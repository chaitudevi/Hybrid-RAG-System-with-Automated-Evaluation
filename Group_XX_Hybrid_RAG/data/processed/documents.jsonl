Art Roger Bradfield won several art contests as a child and had early encouragement from his high school art teacher to pursue a career in the arts . His preferred medium is watercolor , although he has also proven himself to be proficient in pencil , pen and ink , and acrylic . Food products Bradfield worked on the General Mills cereal boxes of the early 1960s. These included children's cereals, such as Kix , Trix , Wheaties and Jets , among other work. He also worked on Mr Bubble and some projects for the Pillsbury Company . In 1964, he did the spot illustrations for the Bisquick Cookbook for the Bisquick baking product.

Children's books \"Jolly\" Roger Bradfield is perhaps best known for his work as a children's book author and illustrator. He began his writing career when he was teaching himself how to type . Bored with the tutorials of his text book , Bradfield chose to practice his typing by writing something fun. Thus, his first book There's an Elephant in the Bathtub was created. Bradfield went on to write and illustrate several other titles including Pickle-Chiffon Pie , Benjamin Dilley's Thirsty Camel , Giants Come in Different Sizes , The Flying Hockey Stick , and Benjamin Dilley's Lavender Lion . The \"Jolly\" Roger books are known mostly for their colorful illustrations and wildly imaginative stories.

Comics From 1972 to 1978, Bradfield worked as a newspaper syndicate cartoonist creating the daily and Sunday comic strip Dooley's World . The strip featured stories centering on a boy and his collection of living toys . These comics featured many unique visual gags and puns . The strip was distributed by King Features Syndicate . In addition to the little boy, Dooley, recurring characters were the Professor, a know-it-all wind-up toy figure, Norman, a sophisticated and reflective wind-up knight , Thelma, an unhappy and bullying rag doll , and Max, an introverted mouse . Paintings Bradfield created vibrant and colorful paintings. These paintings mostly depict subjects that he found on his world travels and playful and fun images that he conjured up with his imagination. His preferred medium was watercolor , but he also dabbled in acrylic , ink , and pencil . World travel He was also an extensive world traveller and visited and sketched in countries that include Greece , Norway , Portugal , France , Italy , Mexico , England , and Spain . On one trip to Mexico, Bradfield's plane had a minor accident resulting in some damage to the plane's wing tanks. So, he enlisted the help of some of the local children getting them to patch the damage up with large wads of bubble gum . The scheme did not work, as the gasoline melted the bubble gum, but the plane managed to reach its destination safely anyway. Personal life and death Bradfield and his wife, Joan, raised five children. He died on December 31, 2021, at the age of 97.

{"id": "doc_fixed_001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_John_Harbour_Bridge", "text": "The Saint John Harbour Bridge is three-span crossing of Saint John Harbour at the mouth of the Saint John River in Saint John , New Brunswick , Canada . It opened in 1968. History Proposals for a bridge crossing of the Saint John Harbour had been a debated topic as early as 1874. During a House of Commons session in April of that year, there was discussion of potentially introducing a harbour crossing via Navy Island . John Ferris , MP of Queen's at the time, opposed the Navy Island crossing and argued that such a bridge would be \"destructive to river craft,\" instead arguing that any harbour crossing should be placed at the Reversing Falls to be high enough to clear passing vessels. By the mid-20th century, the rate of industrial and residential growth in Saint John and surrounding communities necessitated a second bridge over the Saint John River. The old Reversing Falls Bridge was adequate for handling the post-War traffic growth; however public concerns about where to build a new highway and bridge frustrated the idea for many years. On May 1, 1961 the city's Common Council appointed a 6-member citizens' committee which then directed various studies and discussions. Ultimately, the bridge was built as a cooperative project between the federal, provincial and municipal governments. They decided to purchase the majority of the Mill Street Yard from the Canadian Pacific Railway for a new highway alignment which would run through the middle of the city downstream of Reversing Falls. The federally controlled National Harbours Board (now Ports Canada) would build the bridge. Part of this deal involved the NHB collecting a 25\u00a2 toll in each direction. Under the original act prevented any toll increase for forty years without federal, provincial and municipal agreement. . The bridge's construction had early critics, including K. C. Irving , who in 1965 critiqued the $18 million budget through publicly released letters addressed to the vice-chairman of the Harbour Bridge Authority, the Common Council , and the mayor. The selected location remains controversial as it prevents high-clearance vessels from navigating into the upper part of the Saint John Harbour. Construction of the bridge also drew to a close the status of Navy Island as an island within the Inner Harbour and resulted in the demolition of the historic neo- gothic Union Station. Earlier proposals had called for the Saint John Throughway and the bridge to be built north of the Reversing Falls gorge. Design and capacity Saint John Harbour Bridge was designed and built as a hollow box, haunched girder structure. It carries four lanes of traffic across 3 spans, measuring 125 metres (410\u00a0ft), 250 metres (820\u00a0ft), and 125 metres (410\u00a0ft). Contracts for the four main piers were signed in September 1965 and the crossing opened on August 17, 1968 as part of the ambitious Saint John Throughway project. The bridge in 2006 Tolls were set at 25 cents when the bridge was constructed. The Harbour Bridge Authority increased the cash-toll from $0.25 to $0.50 for regular commuter traffic beginning January, 2007. This is the first, and only, permitted rate increase since the bridge was built; however, by 2010, the tolls were eliminated, and the building later demolished. Transfer of authority Meanwhile, by 2010, more than forty years after the bridge was built, it was in need of more than $35 million worth of repairs. Without the necessary repairs, the Harbour Bridge Authority warned it would need to close two lanes of traffic and impose weight restrictions on the bridge, threatening to inhibit traffic flow during commute times as well as posing as a problem to transports coming to and from the bordering state of Maine, USA. The three levels of government negotiating the project's financing. On November 26, 2010 Stephen Harper and David Alward announced an agreement. It eliminated the toll and wiped away a $22.6 million debt, while the Federal Government agreed to pay for half of the $35 million structural repairs. The Bridge Authority was abolished and management of the bridge was placed under the New Brunswick Department of Transportation and Infrastructure . In 2013, the Department announced that it had sold the office building formerly used by the Bridge Authority to the Saint John Port Authority.

Jayd Johnson stars as the protagonist, Paddy Meehan, working for a Glasgow newspaper in the 1980s. Plot The first series of The Field of Blood adapts the novel of the same name, which is set in 1982. This series comprised two episodes, broadcast on BBC One on 8 and 9 May 2011, respectively. The second series adapts the follow-up novel, The Dead Hour , which is set later in the same decade. The second series was commissioned by the BBC in 2012, again containing two episodes, which aired on 8 and 9 August 2013, respectively. Set in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1982, a young female reporter sees an opportunity for a riveting story for her slowly dying city newspaper when a young boy is kidnapped from a Glasgow park and later is found murdered. She sees connections to a year-old prior murder with similar characteristics that nobody else wants to see, and she is determined to connect them and convince the police. Reception Time Out gave the second series four out of five stars and said \"It\u2019s good to see this grubby Glaswegian crime drama get another run \u2013 it slipped under the radar somewhat when it first appeared in 2011.\" Sarah Hughes of The Independent said \"While the television version of The Field of Blood lacks the sense of human fraility of the Denise Mina books on which it's based, occasionally seeming clunky in comparison, its great strength lies in the accurate portrayal of a distant, darker time.\" Sarah Rainey of The Daily Telegraph also gave it four out of five stars and said \"The opening half was bleak but authentic, from the clack-clack of the Olympia typewriters to the obligatory Irn Bru advert. ... The camerawork was clever \u2013 just the right amount of jumpy hand-held shots and haunting close-ups \u2013 and the dialogue was witty.\" Sarah Hughes, also writing for The Guardian , called the first series \"impressive\" and said it was \"a cut above the usual summer schedule-filling fare.\" Lucy Mangan, another journalist for The Guardian said \"this potent brew of corruption, conflict and car coats is nevertheless a waste of David Morrissey's talents\" when talking about the second series. Cast Episode list Series 1 (2011) Series 2 (2013) ^ In Gaelic, the letters MH\u00a0\u2013 when they appear together\u00a0\u2013 are pronounced V in English.

{"id": "doc_fixed_008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic-Man", "text": "This article is about the Headline Comics character. For the real-life technician who was exposed to americium radiation and became known as the Atomic Man, see Harold McCluskey . For the song by Portugal, The Man, see Evil Friends . Atomic-Man is an American superhero created by Charles Voight who appeared in Headline Comics from issue #16 (Nov/Dec 1945) to #21 (Sept/Oct 1946) which were published by Prize Comics . He is often credited for being the first atomic superhero. Origin story Dr. Adam Mann is experimenting with uranium-235 in the aftermath of the first atomic bomb being used in Hiroshima . During the experiment he finds himself being subjected to a strange side effect which changes his body. He finds that he has been changed into a new type of being, a being who was not only immune to most lethal radiations but was also immune to electricity, flame and even bullets. In addition to the change in his body he also found he now possessed many different powers. These superpowers of his included the ability to see radiations which were previously invisible to normal humans. His right hand also now also emitted a large amount of Gamma radiation which allowed him to perform a number of superhuman deeds like punching through brick walls using energy blasts and controlling the minds of other people. When not using his powers he wore a lead glove in his hand to curtail the powers of radiation so as not to harm others. Knowing that the element that had given him his powers could and would be used by others for evil he took the identity of Atomic-Man and dedicated himself to fighting those who might who would try to pervert its use, along with any other criminals, mad scientists or communists who fell under the glow of his right hand.

{"id": "doc_fixed_010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_%26_Legacy", "text": "V & Legacy were a hip hop duo who released the album 2000MG in 1999. History The duo comprised Vlad Radovanov (aka V, born c. 1971) and David Legacy. V originated from Chicago where he had been a member of the hip hop group East of the Rock, and travelled to Los Angeles in 1995, determined to succeed as a rapper. He began performing regularly at the Galaxy Gallery, where he met David Legacy, a local rapper from South Central Los Angeles . United in their dislike of the predominant gangsta rap , they joined forces and began working together, influenced by the likes of Pharcyde and The Freestyle Fellowship . They recorded demos while working their day jobs as a bank teller (Legacy) and cigarette shiller (V). They were finally rewarded with a deal by Flip Records , although they moved to X-Ray Records / Cleopatra Records for their debut release, the \"Lunatic Derelict\" 12-inch in 1999. This was followed by their debut album 2000MG later the same year, which featured guest appearances from George Clinton , DJ Lethal , and Sen Dog and BoBo of Cypress Hill . 2000MG was reissued on CD the following year, but proved to be their final release, although three tracks from the album appeared on the 2004 compilation Cypress Thrill (2004). An extended version of their track \"Monkey Mittens\" with George Clinton was included on the 2004 album A Tribute to Cassidy . V made a guest appearance on Free Murda 's 2007 album RZA Presents Free Murda: Let Freedom Reign . Radovanov later worked as an attorney and co-founded the Universal Records -distributed Cobra Music label in 2006. He has also been involved in film, acting as executive producer for Interloper Films on titles such as We Live in Public , which won the 2009 Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary at the Sundance Festival .

{"id": "doc_fixed_011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bruce_Ellis_Ranken", "text": "Covent Garden , a 1930 portrait by Ranken Portrait of Ernest Thesiger by Ranken in Manchester Art Gallery Warbrook House in Hampshire William Bruce Ellis Ranken (11 April 1881 \u2013 31 March 1941) was a British artist and Edwardian aesthete . Early life and education He was born in Edinburgh , Scotland, to Robert Burt Ranken , a wealthy and successful lawyer, and his wife Mary. He attended Eton College in Eton, Berkshire , and then the Slade School of Art , where he studied under the tutelage of Henry Tonks . A fellow student was the actor Ernest Thesiger , who became a lifelong friend; he was painted by Ranken in 1918, and married Ranken's sister Janette Ranken in 1917. Career Ranken's first exhibition in 1904 at the Carfax Gallery, managed by John Fothergill and William Rothenstein , in London was well received by artists and art critics. He befriended Wilfrid de Glehn and John Singer Sargent . At the outbreak of World War I , Ranken was living at his studio in Chelsea, a short distance from Sargent's studio, with whom he may have ventured to America during the war years. While in the United States, Sargent introduced him to Isabella Stewart Gardner , and he received commissions to paint portraits of the wealthy, including the Whitneys, Vanderbilts and Havermeyers. His output became prodigious as he worked in watercolors , oils and pastels . Returning to Britain in the 1920s, he painted many portraits of the British royal family and the aristocracy, as well as the interiors of their homes. In France during the World War I as a distraction from the trenches, he collected and repaired historical pieces of embroidery for sale with Ernest Thesiger who was invalided and, in 1917, married Ranken's sister, Janette Mary Fernie Ranken (1877-1970). In her biography of Thesiger's friend, Ivy Compton-Burnett , Hilary Spurling suggests that Thesiger and Janette wed largely out of their mutual adoration of Ranken, who shaved his head when he learned of the engagement. On the other hand, it has been said that Janette Ranken was in love with Compton-Burnett's companion, Margaret Jourdain , a fellow Oxford student. Janette Ranken left Jourdain to marry Thesiger. In 1918, Ranken purchased Warbrook House in Eversley, Hampshire , after the success of his first visit to the United States. The maintenance and costs associated with the property proved to be too much in the depression of the early 1930s, and he was forced to give up his beloved house. Ranken died suddenly in London in 1941 and was buried near Warbrook, at St Mary (the church is off the A327 road, about 2 miles from the A30). Public collections Following his unexpected death from a cerebral haemorrhage , his sister Janette gifted over 200 works to be distributed amongst UK public galleries and museums. Ranken's paintings are held in a large number of museum and public collections, including Southampton City Art Gallery , Portsmouth Museum, Bradford Museum, Reading Museum , Bristol Museum and Art Gallery , Northampton Museum , Derby Museum , Leeds City Museum , National Museums Northern Ireland , Glasgow Museums, City of Edinburgh Council and the Government Art Collection .

{"id": "doc_fixed_012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Antivirus", "text": "Personal Antivirus is rogue anti-virus software created by a company named Innovagest (sometimes referred to as \"Innovagest 2000\"), and is related to other rogue software. It claims to be an anti-virus program, but instead merely displays false warnings about virus and spyware infections, and demands money to clean these infections. Description A common way that Personal Antivirus installs itself on a computer is through a malicious pop-up ad (though it may also be installed as part of a malicious video codec package). When a user visits a website hosting a Personal Antivirus ad, a pop-up window appears, claiming to be scanning the computer for virus infections. This \"scan\" inevitably finds a number of virus infections. Afterward, the user is told that they need to buy Personal Antivirus to clean these infections, and is directed to a site that accepts payments. If the user decides to buy and install the program, Personal Antivirus claims to have repaired the infections, but also regularly advertises additional programs or demands more money at regular intervals. New York Times Web Site In September, 2009, the New York Times web site unwittingly started to randomly display ads related to Personal Antivirus. The New York Times uses a mix of in-house advertising and advertising networks to display ads on their web site. The person responsible for the ads originally requested that the New York Times run ads for Vonage VoIP service. Because Vonage had previously advertised directly with the New York Times, the ads were approved and were delivered via a third-party ad network that was unfamiliar to the Times. On September 11, 2009, the Vonage ads that were originally approved switched to Personal Antivirus ads. These ads continued to be displayed throughout the following weekend. The ads were eventually stopped when the New York Times temporarily disabled ads displayed by third-party networks and investigated the source of the Personal Antivirus ads. The New York Times later advised readers that using a reputable, properly-updated anti-virus program would likely resolve any lingering infections from Personal Antivirus. They also discovered that during the same weekend, other sites had experienced similar malicious ads, possibly including the web site of the San Francisco Chronicle . References ^ \"Aurelija\".

Episode Symone ( pictured at RuPaul's DragCon LA in 2022 ) win's the episode's main challenge. Kahmora Hall ( pictured at RuPaul's DragCon LA in 2022 ) is eliminated from the competition. In the Werk Room, the contestants in the \"winners\" group are joined by the other group. Elliott with 2 Ts initially hides behind a screen to avoid detection. The contestants talk about Elliott with 2 Ts, before she reveals herself. On a new day, RuPaul greets the merged group and reveals the main challenge, which tasks contestants with overacting in \"RuPaulmark Channel\" holiday movies. Following are the film titles and group members: Misery Love's Company \u2013 Denali , Elliott with 2 Ts , Kahmora Hall , and Olivia Lux God Loves Flags \u2013 LaLa Ri , Ros\u00e9 , Symone , and Utica Queen April Fool's Rush In \u2013 Gottmik , Joey Jay , Kandy Muse , Tamisha Iman , and Tina Burner The three films are Valentine's Day -, Flag Day -, and April Fools' Day -themed, respectively. The contestants break into groups, review the scripts, select their roles, and begin to rehearse. RuPaul returns to the Werk Room to meet with each group, asking questions and offering advice. RuPaul asks Utica Queen if she has smoked cannabis , prompting an ambiguous reply from the contestant and a hysterical laugh from RuPaul. RuPaul reveals the category for the fashion show (\"Trains for Days\"), then the contestants rehearse and film with Ross Mathews . Back in the Werk Room, the contestants make final preparations for the fashion show. Symone discusses going to prom in drag . Tamisha Iman reveals she has three biological children.

Kahmora Hall wears an outfit for green screen and portrays a tree. Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman appears in all three films; in April Fool's Rush In , he impersonates Prince . According to Billboard , Kahmora Hall's \"tight-fitting, luxuriously accessorized train gown ... would prove to be fatal\" in her lip-sync against Denali. Stephen Daw wrote, \"with her movements hindered, Hall was forced to do her best by walking around the stage while Denali kicked, split, and duck-walked her way back into the competition\". Denali has said of her performance: \"That style of music means a lot to me, and it\u2019s the proudest moment I had on the show!\" Love was later a guest judge on the season's sixth (\" Disco-mentary \"), tenth (\" Freaky Friday Queens \"), and twelfth (\" Nice Girls Roast \") episodes, as well as the fourteenth season 's fourth episode (\" She's a Super Tease \"). Fashion Utica Queen 's runway outfit was inspired by the Curtain Dress ( pictured on display at the National Museum of American History ) designed by Bob Mackie and worn by Carol Burnett during the \" Went with the Wind! \" comedy sketch that originally aired on The Carol Burnett Show in 1976. Inspired by Quetzalcoatl and the quetzal bird , Denali's runway look was described by Kate Kulzick of The A.V Club as \"full Carnival in a bright, feathered leotard with big structured shoulders, a tall, colorful Mohawk wig, and a massive ostrich feather train\". Olivia Lux wears a tall white wig, a coatdress and long train, and a lavender ruffled neck piece with matching boots. Elliott with Two Ts has a white lace bodysuit and a white studded belt, a white ruffled train made of tulle , and tall blonde hair. Kahmora Hall's gold dress has two dragon heads as shoulder pieces, and a dragon tail train in the back. Symone wears a corset and jumpsuit , with a durag that becomes a train. LaLa Ri wears a belted coat, a bodysuit, and thigh-high boots . Inspired by the \" Went with the Wind! \" comedy sketch that originally aired on The Carol Burnett Show on CBS in 1976, Utica Queen wears a \"hoop dress complete with curtain rod and pull tie belt\". Ros\u00e9's look has been described as a \"true blue pantsuit with striking white lapels and a tall white curled Mohawk with a giant blue tulle train\". Gottmik uses a bedazzled leaf blower for wind effects, and Tina Burner's look resembles the uniform of a train conductor . Joey Jay wears a red braid, and Kandy Muse has a red corset. Tamisha Iman wears a pink bodysuit and train. Reception Kate Kulzick of The A.V Club gave the episode a rating of 'B+'. Entertainment Weekly said Kimora Hall \"made herstory as the queen who looked the best during her elimination\". Denali's performance during the lip-sync received both praise and negative criticism, with various outlets consider it among the show's best. Queerty said Denali \"stunned\" during the performance. The lip-sync caused \"100% Pure Love\" to re-enter the Billboard charts . References ^ \" 'RuPaul's Drag Race' Season 13, Episode 4 recap: We made it to the merge!\" . Xtra Magazine .

Once it has reached Chilumba, it starts its travel back to its base in Lusumbwe in the Southern Region of Malawi. Heterogeneity in landscape gives Chilumba a unique environment for diversification of recreation and production activities. From the lake side, it is one of the unique places with Chirwa Island and Chitende Island, that host several species of plants, birds and fishes. The Islands are used by fishermen as temporary docking points. The peninsula facing Chirwa is a typical feature with rocky shore with deep waters potentially suitable for rock diving. The bay facing the jetty has shallow waters for docking boats and potential for shallow water walking to 50m then swim into deep waters facing the Chitende Peninsula and Mphiri hills. West of the peninsula lies a 3 kilometres (2\u00a0mi) stretch of pure sand beach. The sand extends upland a distance of about 1 kilometre (1\u00a0mi) and magnificently looks like a desert of dark sand separated by two swamps. The upper land away from the lake is prime agricultural land used during the 1980s to early 1990s as a maize seed production diversification scheme. Behind lies a natural boundary of forest reserve that extends to the lake through Mphiri hills to the north, ideal for horse riding.

{"id": "doc_fixed_022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huddersfield_R.U.F.C.", "text": "Huddersfield Rugby Union Football Club is an English rugby union club based in Huddersfield , West Yorkshire , England. The team plays in Regional 1 North East following their relegation from National League 2 North at the end of the 2023\u201324 season. The club also competes in the Yorkshire Cup competition and play its home matches at Lockwood Park, which has a capacity of 1,500 with seating for 500. HRUFC also has an academy squad, feeding the senior team with new players. History Rugby football was first played in Huddersfield in 1869 and the club established in 1870. Matches were initially played at the Rifle Field in Trinity Street and then, with the amalgamation of the St John's Cricket Club, at Fartown from 1879. Huddersfield was playing in the top ranks of English clubs when, in August 1895, the town hosted a meeting at the George Hotel and was one of the twenty clubs that resigned from the Rugby Union to set up The Northern Rugby Football Union, which allowed players to be compensated for 'Broken Time.' This meant they could claim for wages lost by playing on Saturdays. They were not allowed to make a living from the game \u2013 they were not 'professional.' A new club was re-formed and named Huddersfield Old Boys in 1909. The club's first ground was at the United Cricket Club in Luck Lane with changing facilities at the Croppers Arms. World War I blew the whistle on the sport and games were not restarted until 1919 on a ground at Salendine Nook initially before the club took a lease on land at Waterloo . It was here that the club established their current colours of white, claret and gold. A stand was built and changing rooms completed for exclusive rugby use a luxury in those days. But the ground was plagued with drainage problems and another move was contemplated. In the event it was decided to buy the ground outright for \u00a3700 and invest in drainage. In 1935 \u00a3370 was invested in a new pavilion and bar and ladies were welcomed to a hitherto male bastion and they themselves began the tradition of post-match tea making. By 1964 the original pavilion was falling to bits and a new one, costing \u00a311,000, was officially opened by Huddersfield's then MP J P W Mallalieu, himself a former Oxford Blue. In 1946 the club changed their name to Huddersfield Rugby Union Football Club. The club sold part of its Waterloo property for \u00a31.4\u00a0million to W Morrison's to help fund the purchase of the 26-acre (110,000\u00a0m 2 ) former brewery estate at Lockwood Park from Bass in 1996 to create a major sports complex backed by a \u00a31.84\u00a0million Sport Council lottery grant. The club won the Yorkshire Cup in 2011 for the first time, beating Hull RUFC 25\u201318 at York RUFC. The Huddersfield team which won the cup in 1890 was the direct antecedent of the Huddersfield Giants and is unconnected to the current Huddersfield RUFC.

{"id": "doc_fixed_026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_division)", "text": "\"H\u00e4rad\" redirects here. For the Swedish locality, see H\u00e4rad, Sweden . A hundred is an administrative division that is geographically part of a larger region. It was formerly used in England, Wales, some parts of the United States, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, and in Cumberland County in the British Colony of New South Wales . It is still used in other places, including in Australia (in South Australia and the Northern Territory ). Other terms for the hundred in English and other languages include wapentake , herred (Danish and Bokm\u00e5l Norwegian ), herad ( Nynorsk Norwegian ), h\u00e4rad or hundare (Swedish), Harde (German), hiird ( North Frisian ), kihlakunta (Finnish), kihelkond (Estonian), and cantref (Welsh). In Ireland, a similar subdivision of counties is referred to as a barony , and a hundred is a subdivision of a particularly large townland (most townlands are not divided into hundreds). Etymology The origin of the division of counties into hundreds is described by the Oxford English Dictionary as \"exceedingly obscure\". It may once have referred to an area of 100 hides ; in early Anglo-Saxon England a hide was the amount of land farmed by and required to support a peasant family, but by the 11th century in many areas it supported four families. Alternatively the hundred may have been an area originally settled by one \"hundred\" men at arms, or the area liable to provide one \"hundred\" men under arms. In this early medieval use, the number term \"hundred\" can be unclear, meaning the \"short\" hundred (100) or in some contexts the long hundred of 120. There was an equivalent traditional Germanic system. In Old High German a huntari is a division of a gau , but the Oxford English Dictionary states that the link between the two is not established. England See also: List of hundreds of England Administrative functions Hundreds of Cornwall in the early 19th century From the 11th century in England \u2013 and to a lesser extent from the 16th century in Wales \u2013 to the middle of the 19th century, the annual assemblies had varying degrees of power at a local level in the feudal system . Of chief importance was their more regular use for taxation, and six centuries of taxation returns for the divisions survive to this day. Groupings of divisions, small shires , were used to define parliamentary constituencies from 1832 to 1885. On the redistribution of seats in 1885 a different county subdivision, the petty sessional division , was used. Hundreds were also used to administer the first five national censuses from 1801 to 1841. The system of county divisions was not as stable as the system of counties being established at the time, and lists frequently differ on how many hundreds a county had. In many parts of the country, the Domesday Book contained a radically different set of divisions from that which later became established. The numbers of divisions in each county varied widely. For example Leicestershire had six (up from four at Domesday), whereas Devon , nearly three times the size, had 32. By the end of the 19th century, several single-purpose subdivisions of counties, such as poor law unions , sanitary districts , and highway districts , had sprung up, which, together with the introduction of urban districts and rural districts in 1894, mostly replaced the role of the parishes, and to a lesser extent the less extensive role of hundreds. The division names gave their name to multiple modern local government districts . Description Map of the Hundreds of Staffordshire , c. 1650. North is to the right. In southern and western England, a hundred was the division of a shire for military and judicial purposes under the common law , which could have varying extent of common feudal ownership, from complete suzerainty to minor royal or ecclesiastical prerogatives and rights of ownership. Until the introduction of districts by the Local Government Act 1894 , hundreds were the only widely used assessment unit intermediate in size between the parish, with its various administrative functions, and the county, with its formal ceremonial functions. The term \"hundred\" is first recorded in the 10th-century laws of King Edmund I as a measure of land and the area served by a hundred court. In the Midlands , they often covered an area of about 100 hides, but this did not apply in the south; this may suggest that it was an ancient West Saxon measure that was applied rigidly when Mercia became part of the newly established English kingdom in the 10th century. The Hundred Ordinance , which dates to the middle of the 10th century, provides that the court was to meet monthly, and thieves were to be pursued by all the leading men of the district. During Norman times, the hundred would pay geld based on the number of hides. To assess how much everyone had to pay, a clerk and a knight were sent by the king to each county; they sat with the shire- reeve (or sheriff ) of the county and a select group of local knights. There would be two knights from each hundred. After it was determined what geld had to be paid, the bailiff and knights of the hundred were responsible for getting the money to the sheriff and the sheriff for getting it to the Exchequer . Above the hundred was the shire, under the control of a sheriff. Hundred boundaries were independent of both parish and county boundaries, although often aligned, meaning that a hundred could be split between counties, or a parish could be split between hundreds. Exceptionally, in the counties of Kent and Sussex , there was a subdivision intermediate in size between the hundred and the shire: several hundreds were grouped together to form lathes in Kent and rapes in Sussex. At the time of the Norman Conquest , Kent was divided into seven lathes and Sussex into four rapes. Hundred courts Over time, the principal functions of the hundred became the administration of law and the keeping of the peace. By the 12th century, the hundred court was held twelve times a year. This was later increased to fortnightly, although an ordinance of 1234 reduced the frequency to once every three weeks. In some hundreds, courts were held at a fixed place; while in others, courts moved with each sitting to a different location. The main duty of the hundred court was the maintenance of the frankpledge system. The court was formed of twelve freeholders , or freemen. According to a 13th-century statute, freeholders did not have to attend their lord's manorial courts, thus any suits involving them would be heard in a hundred court. For especially serious crimes, the hundred was under the jurisdiction of the Crown; the chief magistrate was a sheriff, and his circuit was called the sheriff's tourn . However, many hundreds came into private hands, with the lordship of the hundred being attached to the principal manor of the area and becoming hereditary. Historian Helen Cam estimates that even before the Conquest, over 130 hundreds were in private hands; while an inquest of 1316 found that by that date 388 of 628 named hundreds were held by the king's subjects. Where a hundred was under a lord, a steward \u2013 acting as a judge and the chief official of the lord of the manor \u2013 was appointed in place of a sheriff. The importance of the hundred courts declined from the 17th century, and most of their powers were extinguished with the establishment of county courts in 1867. The remaining duty of the inhabitants of a hundred to make good damages caused by riot was ended by the Riot (Damages) Act 1886 , when the cost was transferred to the county police rate. The jurisdiction of hundred courts was curtailed by the Administration of Justice Act 1977 . Chiltern Hundreds By law in the United Kingdom , a member of parliament (MP) cannot resign their seat , but will be disqualified from sitting if appointed to an \" office of profit under the Crown\". A Crown Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds was appointed to maintain law and order in the area, but these duties ceased to be performed in the 16th century, and the holder ceased to gain any benefits during the 17th century. The position remains in use as a procedural device, with MPs wishing to resign appointed as Crown Stewards. Wapentake A wapentake, an Old Norse \u2013derived term as common in Northern England , was the equivalent of the Anglo-Saxon hundred in the northern Danelaw . In the Domesday Book the term is used instead of hundreds in Yorkshire , the Five Boroughs of Derby , Leicester , Lincoln , Nottingham and Stamford , and also sometimes in Northamptonshire. The laws in wapentakes were similar to those in hundreds with minor variations. According to the 1st-century historian Tacitus , in Scandinavia the wapentake referred to a vote passed at an assembly by the brandishing of weapons. In some counties, such as Leicestershire, the wapentakes recorded at the time of Domesday Book later evolved into hundreds. In others, such as Lincolnshire , the term remained in use. Although no longer part of local government, there is some correspondence between the rural deanery and the former wapentake or hundred; especially in the East Midlands, the Buckingham Archdeaconry and the York Diocese. Wales See also: List of hundreds of Wales Medieval cantrefi of Wales In Wales an ancient Celtic system of division called cantrefi (a hundred farmsteads; singular cantref ) had existed for centuries and was of particular importance in the administration of the Welsh law . The antiquity of the cantrefi is demonstrated by the fact that they often mark the boundary between dialects . Some were originally kingdoms in their own right; others may have been artificial units created later. With the coming of Christianity, the llan (similar to the parish) based Celtic churches often took the borders of the older cantrefi, and the same happened when Norman 'hundreds' were enforced on the people of Wales. Each cantref had its own court, which was an assembly of the uchelwyr , the main landowners of the cantref . This would be presided over by the king if he happened to be present, or if he was not present, by his representative. Apart from the judges there would be a clerk, an usher and sometimes two professional pleaders. The cantref court dealt with crimes, the determination of boundaries, and inheritance. Nordic countries See also: Hundreds of Denmark See also: List of hundreds of Sweden Map of medieval Denmark, showing herreder and sysler . The entire country was divided into herreder , shown outlined in red. Coloured areas show Jutland's syssel divisions. Zealand's four ecclesiastic sysler are not included. The term hundare ( hundred ) was used in Svealand and present-day Finland. The name is assumed to mean an area that should organise 100 men to crew four rowed war boats, which each had 12 pairs of oars and a commander. Eventually, that division was superseded by introducing the h\u00e4rad or Herred , which was the term in the rest of the Nordic countries . This word was derived from either Proto-Norse * harja-rai\u00f0\u014d (warband) or Proto-Germanic * harja-rai\u00f0a (war equipment, cf. wapentake) . Similar to skipreide , a part of the coast where the inhabitants were responsible for equipping and manning a war ship. Hundreds were not organized in Norrland , the northern sparsely populated part of Sweden. In Sweden, a countryside h\u00e4rad was typically divided into a few socken units (parish), where the ecclesiastical and worldly administrative units often coincided. This began losing its basic significance through the Swedish municipal reform of 1862. A h\u00e4rad was originally a subdivision of a landskap (province), but since the government reform of 1634, l\u00e4n (\"county\") took over all administrative roles of the province. A h\u00e4rad functioned also as electoral district for one peasant representative during the Riksdag of the Estates (Swedish parliament 1436\u20131866). The h\u00e4radsr\u00e4tt ( assize court ) was the court of first instance in the countryside, abolished in 1971 and superseded by tingsr\u00e4tt (modern district courts ). Today, the hundreds serve no administrative role in Sweden, although some judicial district courts still bear the name (e.g. Attunda tingsr\u00e4tt ) and the hundreds are occasionally used in expressions, e.g. Sjuh\u00e4radsbygden (district of seven hundreds). It is not entirely clear when hundreds were organised in the western part of Finland. The name of the province of Satakunta , roughly meaning hundred ( sata meaning \"one hundred\" in Finnish), hints at influences from the times before the Northern Crusades , Christianization , and incorporation into Sweden. As kihlakunta , hundreds remained the fundamental administrative division for the state authorities until 2009. Each was subordinated to a l\u00e4\u00e4ni (province/county) and had its own police department, district court and prosecutors. Typically, cities would comprise an urban kihlakunta by themselves, but several rural municipalities would belong to a rural kihlakunta . In a rural hundred the lensmann (chief of local state authorities) was called nimismies (\"appointed man\"), or archaically vallesmanni (from Swedish). In the Swedish era (up to 1809), his main responsibilities were maintenance of stagecoach stations and coaching inns , supplying traveling government personnel with food and lodging, transport of criminal prisoners, police responsibilities, arranging district court proceedings ( tingsr\u00e4tt ), collection of taxes, and sometimes arranging hunts to cull the wolf and bear population. Following the abolition of the provinces as an administrative unit in 2009, the territory for each authority could be demarcated separately, i.e. police districts need not equal court districts in number. The title \"h\u00e4rad\" survives in the honorary title of herastuomari (Finnish) or h\u00e4radsdomare (Swedish), which can be given to lay judges after 8\u201310 years of service. The term herred or herad was used in Norway between 1863 and 1992 for rural municipalities, besides the term kommune (heradskommune). Today, only three municipalities in western Norway call themselves herad : Ulvik herad Kvam herad , and Voss herad . Some Norwegian places have the word herad in their name, of historical reasons such as Kr\u00f8dsherad and Heradsbygd in Norway. United States Counties in Delaware , New Jersey and Pennsylvania were divided into hundreds in the 17th century, following the English practice familiar to the colonists. They survive in Delaware and were used as tax reporting and voting districts until the 1960s but now serve no administrative role: their only official legal use is in real estate title descriptions. Following American independence, the term \"hundred\" fell out of favor and was replaced by \"election district\". However, the names of the old hundreds continue to show up in deeds for another 50 years. Some plantations in Colonial Virginia used the term hundred in their names, such as Martin's Hundred , Flowerdew Hundred , and West and Shirley Hundred . Bermuda Hundred was the first incorporated town in Virginia; it was founded by Sir Thomas Dale in 1613, six years after Jamestown . While debating what became the Land Ordinance of 1785 , Thomas Jefferson 's committee wanted to divide the public lands in the west into \"hundreds of ten geographical miles square, each mile containing 6086 and 4-10ths of a foot\". The legislation instead introduced the six-mile square township of the Public Land Survey System . The hundred was used as a division of the county in Maryland . Carroll County was formed in 1836 by taking hundreds from Baltimore County and from Frederick County . Somerset County , which was established in 1666, was initially divided into six hundreds: Mattapony , Pocomoke, Boquetenorton, Wicomico, and Baltimore Hundreds; later subdivisions of the hundreds added five more: Pitts Creek, Acquango, Queponco, Buckingham, and Worcester Hundreds. The original borders of Talbot County (founded at some point prior to 12 February 1661 ) contained nine hundreds: Treadhaven Hundred, Bolenbroke Hundred, Mill Hundred, Tuckahoe Hundred, Worrell Hundred, Bay Hundred, Island Hundred, Lower Kent Island Hundred, Chester Hundred. In 1669 Chester Hundred was given to Kent County. In 1707 Queen Anne's County was created from the northern parts of Talbot County, reducing the latter to seven hundreds (Lower Kent Island Hundred becoming a part of the former). Of these, only Bay Hundred legally remains in existence, as District 5 in Talbot County. The geographic region, which includes several unincorporated communities and part of present-day Saint Michaels , continues to be known by the name Bay Hundred, with state and local governments using the name in ways ranging from water trail guides to community pools, while local newspapers regularly use the name in reporting news. Australia Main article: Lands administrative divisions of Australia In South Australia, land titles record in which hundred a parcel of land is located. Similar to the notion of the South Australian counties listed on the system of titles, hundreds are not generally used when referring to a district and are little known by the general population, except when transferring land title. When the land in the region of the present Darwin, in the Northern Territory, was first surveyed, the territory was administered by South Australia, and the surveyed land was divided up into hundreds. The Cumberland County ( Sydney ) was also allocated hundreds in the nineteenth century, although these were later repealed. A hundred is traditionally one hundred square miles or 64,000 acres (26,000\u00a0ha), although this is often not exact as boundaries often follow local topography.

It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19235. Rhyme The version given by The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes is: Round and round the garden Like a teddy bear; One step, two step, Tickle you under there! Origins The rhyme was first collected in Britain in the late 1940s. Since teddy bears did not come into vogue until the twentieth century it is likely to be fairly recent in its current form, but Iona and Peter Opie suggest that it is probably a version of an older rhyme, \"Round about there\": Round about there Sat a little hare, The bow-wows came and chased him Right up there! Accompanying actions The adult reciting the verse starts by tracing an index finger in circles on the child's upturned palm, then walks their fingers up the arm with each \"step\", ending with a tickle under the child's arm.

{"id": "doc_fixed_029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Michigan_UFO_event", "text": "On March 8, 1994, multiple individuals reported a sighting of multiple UFOs in West Michigan , United States. The UFOs were described as resembling flickering Christmas lights , consisting of five or six objects, cylindrically shaped or circles with blue, red, white and green lights. Radar data On March 11, press covered comments from the official in charge at the local National Weather Service office, who acknowledged radar data suggesting a \"fast moving phenomenon\" over Lake Michigan on March 8; He reported the sighting to the National UFO Reporting Center. He relayed eyewitness reports that featured \"red and green sets of lights\" which performed \"some rather erratic movements at times\". The sightings were reported to 9-1-1 and were observed by police and a National Weather Service radar at Muskegon County Airport . Witnesses Reports of sightings of March 8 were followed by a subsequent \" UFO flap \". According to Chicago Tribune , in the aftermath, UFO sightings were reported by over 300 witnesses in 42 counties of Michigan (including Muskegon , Ottawa , Berrien and Allegan counties). Interpretations On March 20, experts from the National Weather Service dismissed the radar blips , noting their radar is designed to sense weather not aircraft. Press speculated that the sightings could have been caused by a top-secret US aircraft, though aviation experts expressed skepticism. Press similarly covered a psychologist who opined the sightings were caused by social contagion , likening them to apparitions of Mary the mother of Jesus in stains on a water tower. The Detroit Free Press reported that residents of the very-religious Holland, Michigan were interpreting the sightings as a biblical sign. Assessment by the Mutual UFO Network By March 20, the Mutual UFO Network spokesperson told press they had received over 100 UFO reports in lower Michigan since the initial sightings on March 8. The group interviewed dozens of witnesses, but the event remains unexplained. The group claims to have ruled out most earthly explanations, such as a small plane, gas, blimp, weather balloon, satellite, shooting star, military aircraft or debris. Radar operator In 1996, Jack Bushong, the radar operator that night, began speaking publicly about the incident. Bushong recalled having been called by a 911 dispatcher around 10 that night. In 2008, he appeared on the show \"UFO Hunters\" In 2019, on the 25th anniversary of the event, local media interviewed witness Cindy Pravda. In 2020, retired meteorologist Jack Bushong was interviewed about his experiences at the National Weather Service station the night of March 8, 1994. In 2021, Bushong reported that he \"felt vindicated\" by a recent government UFO report. The event was detailed on an episode of the Netflix series Unsolved Mysteries in 2022; Bushong was featured. In 2024, Bushong recalled using the WSR-74C radar to scan the skies in response to dispatcher call. References ^ a b \"Retired meteorologist shares his account of 1994 West Michigan UFO sightings\" .

Exemption of $3,000 for a single filer, $4,000 for a married couple, and $4,000 for a head of household. Inflation-adjusted numbers Report of payments The War Revenue Act of 1917 required every entity to report certain payments made to another entity. Payments subject to reporting included payments of interest, rent, salaries, wages, premiums, annuities, compensation, remuneration, emoluments, or other fixed or determinable gains, profits, and income. Payments to an entity were required to be reported if the payments totaled at least $800 during the year. The payor was required to report the name and address of the payee and the total amount of payments on Form 1099 and sent to the Internal Revenue Service by March 1 of the year following the payments.

{"id": "doc_fixed_035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Green_(novelist)", "text": "Sarah Green ( fl . 1790 \u2013 1825) was an Irish-English author, one of the ten most prolific novelists of the first two decades of the nineteenth century. Life and writing Green was probably born in Ireland and then later moved to London . Very little is known of her aside from what has been pieced together of her publishing history. She produced works in an array of genres: novels, tales, romances, and, notably, like Jane Austen , mock-romances. She also wrote at least one religious work, as well as conduct literature, a translation, and editing work. Eight of her works were published with the popular Minerva Press by William Lane or his successor, Anthony Newman. \"It is ironic,\" one commentator has written, that her moral tract, Mental improvement for a young lady (1793) \"condemns all novels save those of Fanny Burney .\" Later works, however, engage with a range of other writers: in Scotch Novel Reading (1824), in addition to Burney, Green variously refers to or evokes Lord Byron , Charlotte Dacre , Charlotte Lennox , Sydney Owenson , Ann Radcliffe , and Walter Scott . Her Private History of the Court of England (privately printed, 1808) is a fictionalized account of the life of writer Mary Robinson . Initially Green published anonymously, but after 1810 she began to publish under her own name.

{"id": "doc_fixed_036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_B%C3%A1thory", "text": "Gabriel B\u00e1thory ( Hungarian : B\u00e1thory G\u00e1bor ; 15 August\u00a0[ O.S. 5 August]\u00a01589 \u2013 27 October 1613) was Prince of Transylvania from 1608 to 1613. The Ottomans nicknamed him \"Deli Kiral\" (Mad King). Born to the Roman Catholic branch of the B\u00e1thory family , he was closely related to four rulers of the Principality of Transylvania (a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire which had developed in the eastern territories of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary ). His father, Stephen B\u00e1thory , held estates in the principality, but never ruled it. Being a minor when his father died in 1601, Gabriel became the ward of the childless Stephen B\u00e1thory , from the Protestant branch of the family, who converted him to Calvinism . After inheriting most of his guardian 's estates in 1605, Gabriel became one of the wealthiest landowners in Transylvania and Royal Hungary (a realm of the Habsburg Empire which included the northern and western parts of medieval Hungary). Gabriel made an alliance with the Hajd\u00fas \u2014irregular troops stationing along the borders of Transylvania and Royal Hungary\u2014and laid claim to Transylvania against the elderly prince, Sigismund R\u00e1k\u00f3czi in February 1608. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi abdicated and the Diet of Transylvania elected Gabriel prince without resistance. Both the Sublime Porte and the Habsburg ruler Matthias II acknowledged Gabriel's election. He ignored the privileges of the Transylvanian Saxons and captured their wealthiest town, Szeben (now Sibiu in Romania), provoking an uprising in 1610. His attempts to expand his authority over the Ottoman vassal Wallachia and his negotiations with Matthias II outraged the Ottoman Sultan Ahmed I . The Sultan decided to replace Gabriel with an exiled Transylvanian nobleman, Gabriel Bethlen , and sent troops to invade the principality in August 1613. Transylvania was unable to resist and the Diet dethroned Gabriel. He was murdered by Hajd\u00fa assassins. Early life Childhood Ruins of the B\u00e1thorys' castle at Szil\u00e1gysomly\u00f3 (now \u0218imleu Silvaniei in Romania) B\u00e1thory was born in V\u00e1rad (now Oradea in Romania) before dawn on 15 August 1589. His father, Stephen B\u00e1thory , was a cousin of Prince of Transylvania Sigismund B\u00e1thory . Stephen was captain of V\u00e1rad when Gabriel was born. Gabriel's mother was his father's first wife, Zsuzsanna Bebek. Although she had already given birth to four children, none survived infancy. Sigismund B\u00e1thory dismissed Gabriel's father from V\u00e1rad in the summer of 1592, and Gabriel's family then moved to the B\u00e1thorys' ancient castle in Szil\u00e1gysomly\u00f3 (now \u0218imleu Silvaniei in Romania). The Principality of Transylvania emerged after the disintegration of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary in the 1540s. The principality included the eastern and northeastern regions of the medieval kingdom and its princes paid a yearly tribute to the Ottoman sultans. The princes were elected by the Diet, but they were to seek the Ottoman sultans' confirmation to rule the principality. The Habsburg kings of Royal Hungary regarded the principality as a part of their realm and the first rulers of the principality acknowledged the Habsburgs' claim in secret treaties in the 1570s. The Diet of Transylvania consisted primarily of the representatives of the Three Nations (that is the Hungarian noblemen , the Saxon burghers and the Sz\u00e9kelys ). Sigismund B\u00e1thory, who was a devout Catholic, wanted to join the Holy League of Pope Clement VIII against the Ottoman Empire , but most Transylvanian noblemen opposed his plan. Stephen B\u00e1thory's brother, Balthasar , was an opposition leader. Balthasar was captured and murdered at Sigismund's order in late August 1594. Gabriel's father fled from Transylvania to Poland, leaving his family behind in Szil\u00e1gysomly\u00f3; the five-year-old Gabriel was imprisoned with his mother and newborn sister, Anna . Stephen and Balthasar's brother, Cardinal Andrew B\u00e1thory (who lived in Poland), persuaded Pope Clement VIII to intervene on their behalf. Gabriel, his mother and sister were freed at the pope's request and were allowed to join Stephen in Poland. His mother became seriously ill, and died near the end of 1595. The Ottomans routed the armies of the Holy League in a series of battles after 1595. Sigismund B\u00e1thory abdicated in favor of Gabriel's uncle, Andrew, in early 1599 in the hope that Andrew could regain the Ottoman sultans' favor with Polish mediation. Gabriel's father accompanied Andrew back to Transylvania, and his family followed him. Michael the Brave , Prince of Wallachia , who had joined the Holy League, invaded Transylvania and defeated Andrew with the assistance of Sz\u00e9kely troops. After Sz\u00e9kely commoners murdered Andrew, Michael the Brave took possession of Transylvania. Gabriel's father fled to K\u0151v\u00e1r (now Remetea Chioarului in Romania) and swore fealty to the Holy Roman Emperor , Rudolph (who was also king of Hungary ), before his death on 21 February 1601. In guardianship The orphaned Gabriel and Anna were placed in the guardianship of their father's childless cousin, Stephen B\u00e1thory , and lost most of their father's estates; Szil\u00e1gysomly\u00f3 was seized by the royal treasury, and their scattered estates in Szatm\u00e1r , Szabolcs and Kraszna Counties were seized by a distant cousin, Peter Szaniszl\u00f3fi. Scholar J\u00e1nos Czegl\u00e9di educated Gabriel in Nagyecsed , and the wealthy Stephen B\u00e1thory converted Gabriel from Catholicism to Calvinism. Gabriel pledged that he would expel Catholics, Lutherans and Unitarians from his estates. The young Gabriel's strength was legendary, and he was said to break horseshoes with his bare hands. Rudolf's troops occupied Transylvania in 1603 and his officials started to confiscate the estates of noblemen through legal proceedings on false charges of treason. One of the wealthiest landowners, Stephen Bocskai , was accused of maintaining secret correspondence with Transylvanian exiles in 1604. To avoid imprisonment, he rose up in open rebellion with the backing of the Hajd\u00fa, irregular troops stationed along the borders of Transylvania and Royal Hungary. Although Stephen B\u00e1thory did not openly support Bocskai, he sent Gabriel to Bocskai's court in Kassa. Sixteen-year-old Gabriel participated in a battle against the royal army near S\u00e1rospatak in early February 1605; three years later, poet J\u00e1nos Rimay accused him of fleeing the battlefield. Rimay also said that Gabriel spent his days mainly drinking wine and allegedly had an affair with his aunt, Kata Iffj\u00fa (who was over thirty years old at the time). Rise to power Bocskai was elected prince of Transylvania on 21 February 1605 and prince of Hungary on 20 April of that year. His realm included most of Transylvania proper, Partium and Upper Hungary . Stephen B\u00e1thory died on 25 July 1605. He had willed most of his estates to Gabriel, who became one of the wealthiest noblemen in Bocskai's realm. Bocskai hinted that he regarded Gabriel as his successor, ordering B\u00e1lint Drugeth (commander-in-chief of his army in Upper Hungary) to \"hold Gabriel B\u00e1thory in the highest esteem among the Hungarian lords\" if he did not return from his meeting with Ottoman Grand Vizier Lala Mehmed Pasha in November 1605. Young noblemen (including Gabriel's future enemy, Gabriel Bethlen) and military officials also supported Gabriel. Years later, G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Bojti Veres wrote that Gabriel hosted feasts to win popularity with Bocskai's courtiers and commanders. Gabriel's relatives, Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1thay (Bocskai's chancellor) and J\u00e1nos Imreffy (Kata Iffj\u00fa's husband), were his principal supporters. His position weakened after Bocskai who was taken ill suddenly had K\u00e1thay imprisoned for treason in early September 1606. K\u00e1thay's opponents, Simon P\u00e9chi and J\u00e1nos Rimay, persuaded the dying (and often unconscious) Bocskai to name B\u00e1lint Drugeth his successor in his last will. The B\u00e1thorys' fortress at Nagyecsed in 1688 Bocskai died in Kassa on 29 December 1606. A mob accused K\u00e1thay of poisoning Bocskai, and lynched him on 12 January 1607. Gabriel had demanded the Principality of Transylvania in a 2 January 1607 letter to the grand vizier, Kuyucu Murad Pasha . Bocskai's deputy, the elderly Sigismund R\u00e1k\u00f3czi , continued to administer the principality with the consent of the Diet of Transylvania . Gabriel sent Bethlen to Sz\u00e9kely captain J\u00e1nos Petki to secure his support, but Bethlen was imprisoned at R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's order on 26 January. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi also dismissed V\u00e1rad captain D\u00e9nes B\u00e1nffy, the fianc\u00e9 of Gabriel's sister Anna. The delegates of the Three Nations of Transylvania wanted to demonstrate their right to freely elect the prince. The Diet first passed a decree prohibiting a minor from being elected prince, preventing Gabriel's election. It ignored Bocskai's last will, electing R\u00e1k\u00f3czi prince on 12 February. Gabriel mustered troops, saying that he only wanted to protect Transylvania. He demanded the cancellation of the Transylvanian decrees ordering the confiscation of his father and uncles' estates in 1595. Gabriel approached Rudolph I's councillors after the Diet expelled the Jesuits from Transylvania, offering to defend the Catholic Church in the principality if he ascended the throne and saying that he was ready to reconvert to Catholicism. Rudolph made him governor of Transylvania in June, but the appointment had no real effect on Gabriel's position. Gabriel married Bocskai's kinswoman, Anna Horv\u00e1th Palocsai, about two months later. After being unpaid for months, the Hajd\u00fas rose up in the autumn of 1607. They offered their support to Drugeth, who refused to lead them. Gabriel also treated them with disdain and promised to protect Transylvania against them at the end of October. He soon mustered his troops and marched to Upper Hungary. He again approached the royal court, asking Rudolph to make him voivode of Transylvania . After the representatives of the Hajd\u00fas and the noblemen of Upper Hungary made a fifty-day truce in In\u00e1ncs at the end of the year, Gabriel began negotiations with the Hajd\u00fas. They concluded a treaty on 8 February 1608. Gabriel pledged to grant villages to the Hajd\u00fas in Partium, and they promised to support him in seizing Transylvania. He also promised to expel \"heretics and idolaters\" (Unitarians and Catholics) from the royal council. According to the contemporary Ferenc Nagy Szab\u00f3's memoirs, the Ottoman grand vizier soon decided to support Gabriel. Gabriel sent Imreffy to R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, offering to help R\u00e1k\u00f3czi seize two important domains in Upper Hungary if R\u00e1k\u00f3czi abdicated. He informed Rudolph's commissioner, Zsigmond Forg\u00e1ch , on 13 February 1608 that R\u00e1k\u00f3czi had already agreed to leave Transylvania. Although the Hajd\u00fas took control of the northwestern region of Partium, Gabriel forbade them to invade Transylvania proper. J\u00e1nos Petki announced R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's abdication at the Diet in Kolozsv\u00e1r (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) on 5 March of that year. Reign Consolidation Michael Weiss , mayor of Brass\u00f3 (now Bra\u0219ov in Romania) The Diet elected Gabriel prince on 7 March 1608, and sent delegates to him in Nagyecsed. Although his election was technically free, he controlled the strongest army in the principality (making resistance impossible). He pledged to respect the laws of the principality, especially the privileges of the Three Nations, before accepting his election on 14\u00a0March. Gabriel was ceremoniously installed in Kolozsv\u00e1r on 31 March, and the Diet granted him the domains of Fogaras (now F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 in Romania) and K\u0151v\u00e1r as hereditary estates. He began settling the Hajd\u00fas in Partium, and granted B\u00f6sz\u00f6rm\u00e9ny to those forced to leave Nagyk\u00e1ll\u00f3 ; others received parcels in Bihar County . About 30,000 Hajd\u00fa soldiers received parcels of land from Gabriel during his reign. To assert his suzerainty over Wallachia and Moldavia , he decided to dethrone Prince Radu \u0218erban of Wallachia; however, the royal council and Michael Weiss (mayor of the important Transylvanian Saxon town of Brass\u00f3, now Bra\u0219ov in Romania) dissuaded him. Radu \u0218erban voluntarily swore fealty to Gabriel in the presence of his envoys on 31 May. On 18 July, thirteen-year-old Prince of Moldavia Constantin I Movil\u0103 also acknowledged Gabriel's suzerainty and promised to pay a yearly tribute of 8,000 florins. That month, Gabriel visited Brass\u00f3. His feasts infuriated the burghers, who called him a drunkard or a greedy new Sardanapalus in defamatory poems. Gabriel's promiscuity was notorious; he reportedly seduced young women and promoted noblemen who were willing to offer him their wives. He sent Bethlen to Istanbul and Imreffy to Kassa to secure his recognition by the Sublime Porte and the royal court. After a brief negotiation, Imreffy and representatives of Rudolph's brother Matthias (who had persuaded Rudolph to abdicate in his favor) signed two treaties on 20 August. The first treaty summarized the privileges of the Hajd\u00fas in Royal Hungary and the Principality of Transylvania. The second recognized Gabriel as lawful ruler of Transylvania, but forbade him to secede from the Holy Crown of Hungary . Bethlen returned from Istanbul in late November with the sultan's delegates, who brought the ahidn\u00e2me confirming Gabriel's election. The sultan exempted Transylvania from paying the customary tribute for three years. Romanian Orthodox priests approached Gabriel for support against noblemen who treated them like serfs. At their request, he freed them from taxation and service demands by the landowners in June 1609. Gabriel also granted them the right to freely move about the principality. At his initiative, in October the Diet abolished all grants which had exempted some noble estates from taxation. Assassination attempt While Gabriel was sleeping at Istv\u00e1n Kendi 's home in Sz\u00e9k (now Sic in Romania) during the night of 10\u201311 March 1610, a man entered his bedroom. Although the intruder had wanted to stab Gabriel, he changed his mind and confessed that Kendi and other (mostly-Catholic) noblemen had hired him. Kendi soon fled to Royal Hungary, but his accomplices were captured. The Diet sentenced the conspirators to death on 24 March, and their estates were confiscated. Gabriel made Imreffy chancellor and Bethlen captain of the Sz\u00e9kelys. The motivation for the conspiracy is unclear. According to the contemporary Tam\u00e1s Borsos , the conspirators wanted to murder Gabriel because his undisciplined Hajd\u00fa troops had destroyed many villages. Calvinist pastor M\u00e1t\u00e9 Szepsi Laczk\u00f3 said that the Catholic noblemen wanted to get rid of the Protestant prince. Others claimed that Boldizs\u00e1r Kornis (captain of the Sz\u00e9kelys) joined the plot because Gabriel had tried to seduce his young wife. Gabriel met Palatine of Hungary Gy\u00f6rgy Thurz\u00f3 in Kir\u00e1lydar\u00f3c (now Craidorol\u021b in Romania) in June, but they could not reach an agreement. He said during the negotiations that he was a sovereign, but the palatine was merely a \"lord's serf\". After returning to Transylvania, Gabriel planned to reunite Royal Hungary and Transylvania under his rule with Ottoman support. Although he ordered the princes of Moldavia and Wallachia to send reinforcements and the Saxons to pay a tax of 100,000 florins, the prince of Moldavia did not send troops and the Saxons paid only 10,000 florins. Imreffy again went to Royal Hungary to negotiate with Thurz\u00f3 in Kassa. By 15 August, they reached a compromise which resolved most of the contentious issues. However, Matthias II did not ratify the agreement because it stated that Transylvania was not required to provide military assistance to Royal Hungary against the Ottomans. Conflicts Szeben during the 17th century Gabriel went to Szeben (now Sibiu in Romania), the wealthiest Saxon town, on 10 December. Although only 50 soldiers accompanied him into the town, his army was stationed on the outskirts. Gabriel stopped at the gate of the town the following day, pretending that he only wanted to study it; while the gate was open, his army unexpectedly marched in and captured the town without resistance. He said that he wanted to secure his entry into Szeben because the Saxons could refuse monarchs entry into their towns. According to the contemporaneous Diego de Estrada , Gabriel wanted to transfer his capital to Szeben from Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r (now Alba Iulia in Romania), which had been destroyed during the Long Turkish War . The Diet declared Szeben capital of the principality on 17 December, limiting its privileges, authorizing noblemen to acquire real estate and Calvinist priests to preach in the town's Lutheran churches. Gabriel launched a military campaign against Wallachia on 26 December. Radu \u015eerban fled the country, enabling Gabriel to take possession of T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te without resistance. Gabriel styled himself prince of Wallachia in a 26 January 1611 charter. According to Radu Popescu's chronicle, his troops brought pillage, destruction and death to the countryside. Gabriel sent his envoys to Istanbul, asking Ottoman Sultan Ahmed I to confirm his rule in Wallachia. He outlined a plan for the conquest of Poland. He also demanded compensation for the salaries of his Hajd\u00fas from the Ottomans, who began to call him \"Deli Kiral\" (Mad King) because of his actions. The Ottoman governors of Buda and Temesv\u00e1r (now Timi\u0219oara in Romania) invaded the Hajd\u00fa villages in Partium, forcing them to hurry back and defend their homes. Ahmed I granted Wallachia to Radu Mihnea and ordered Gabriel to return to Transylvania in March. Although the sultan's decision outraged Gabriel, he had no choice but to accept it. Radu \u015eerban ousted Radu Mihnea from Wallachia at the head of an army of Cossack and Moldavian mercenaries. The Diet ordered the mobilization of the Transylvanian army, authorizing Gabriel to collect an extraordinary tax in April. However, Michael Weiss (who had regarded Gabriel as a new Nero ) incited the burghers of Brass\u00f3 to rise up against the monarch. Gabriel dispatched Hajd\u00fa captain Andr\u00e1s Nagy to lay siege to Brass\u00f3, but Weiss bribed Nagy to lift the siege. Radu \u015eerban invaded Burzenland (now \u021aara B\u00e2rsei in Romania) unexpectedly, and routed Gabriel's army near Brass\u00f3 on 8 July 1611. Gabriel barely escaped from the battlefield to Szeben. Matthias II considered Gabriel's attack against Wallachia as treachery, because he regarded Transylvania and the two Romanian principalities as realms of the Hungarian Crown. Zsigmond Forg\u00e1ch, commander-in-chief of Upper Hungary, invaded Transylvania in late June. Although Nagy and the Hajd\u00fas under his command supported Forg\u00e1ch, most Protestant noblemen refused to join the invasion. Most Transylvanians regarded the invasion as an unlawful action, and only the Saxons were willing to support Forg\u00e1ch. He and Radu \u015eerban besieged Szeben, but could not capture it. Gabriel sent envoys to Istanbul, seeking assistance from the Sublime Porte. Nagy and his Hajd\u00fa troops deserted Forg\u00e1ch and routed the reinforcements sent to him from Upper Hungary in mid-September. After learning of the arrival of Ottoman troops to support Gabriel, Radu \u015eerban withdrew from Szeben; this forced Forg\u00e1ch to lift the siege. The Transylvanian army routed the retreating royal troops, capturing hundreds of soldiers. Gabriel led his army from Szeben to V\u00e1rad, but the Ottoman troops did not accompany him. Delegates of the counties and towns of Upper Hungary persuaded Thurz\u00f3 to begin negotiations with Gabriel, and their envoys signed an agreement in Tokaj in December. Gabriel pledged to send delegates to the Diet of Hungary and not allow serfs to join the Hajd\u00fas. However, the princes of the Holy Roman Empire persuaded Matthias II not to ratify the treaty until Gabriel reached an agreement with the Saxons. Meanwhile, Gabriel sent Hajd\u00fa captain Andr\u00e1s G\u00e9czi to Istanbul to express his gratitude for Ottoman support. G\u00e9czi made an agreement with Michael Weiss in Brass\u00f3, however, and asked for Gabriel's removal on behalf of the Three Nations of Transylvania in Istanbul in November. The Imperial Council of the Ottoman Empire accepted the proposal, and decided to replace Gabriel with G\u00e9czi. After the burghers of Brass\u00f3 refused to surrender, Gabriel invaded Burzenland and captured seven Saxon fortresses in late March and early April 1612. The Diet of Transylvania urged the Saxons of Brass\u00f3 to surrender in May, but the Three Nations delegates did not punish the noblemen who had fled to the town. Gabriel proposed a month later at the Diet that the principality should renounce the sultan's suzerainty, but his proposal was refused. G\u00e9czi sent letters to Andr\u00e1s Nagy (who promised to murder Gabriel), but Nagy's letter was captured. Gabriel killed Nagy or had him executed in August, according to various sources. Gabriel Bethlen (the leading figure of the pro-Ottoman policy) fled to Ottoman territory on 12 September, and visited the Ottoman governors of Temesv\u00e1r, Buda and Kanizsa . With their help, he contacted the grand vizier Nasuh Pasha . Weiss, who wanted to install G\u00e9czi as prince in Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, left Brass\u00f3 at the head of an undisciplined army on 8 October 1612. Gabriel attacked Weiss and his troops, annihilating them six days later. Weiss was beheaded on the battlefield, and G\u00e9czi withdrew to Brass\u00f3. The Diet sentenced the absent G\u00e9czi and Bethlen to death, granting amnesty to those who had surrendered. Fall V\u00e1rad (now Oradea in Romania) in 1617 The Diet authorized Gabriel to begin negotiations with Matthias II, and their envoys signed an alliance in Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) on 24 December 1612. Matthias sent his delegates to Transylvania to urge the Saxons to surrender to Gabriel. The treaty outraged Ahmed I, who decided to replace Gabriel with Bethlen in March. Matthias and Gabriel's envoys concluded a new treaty on 12 April, and Matthias acknowledged Gabriel's hereditary right to rule Transylvania. In a secret agreement, Gabriel promised to support Matthias even against the Ottomans. He granted a royal pardon to the Saxons and their allies, including G\u00e9czi (who was made commander of Gabriel's guard). Gabriel Bethlen left Istanbul in August, accompanied by Skender, the Pasha of Kanizsa. Radu Mihnea invaded Transylvania from Wallachia in early September. Canibek Giray , Khan of the Crimean Tatars , invaded the principality three weeks later. By early October, Ottoman troops arrived to support Bethlen. Gabriel fled from Transylvania proper and withdrew to V\u00e1rad to seek assistance from Royal Hungary against Bethlen and his allies. Zsigmond Forg\u00e1ch sent an army of 2,000 troops, commanded by Mikl\u00f3s Abafy, to V\u00e1rad. Skender Pasha convoked the delegates of the Three Nations to a Diet at Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. The Diet dethroned Gabriel on 21 October, urging him in a letter of farewell to accept the decision, and elected Bethlen prince two days later. According to the contemporaneous historian M\u00e1t\u00e9 Szepsi Lack\u00f3, Andr\u00e1s G\u00e9czi and Mikl\u00f3s Abaffy soon hatched a plot to murder Gabriel in V\u00e1rad. They entered his room on 26 October 1613 and persuaded him to give them his sword, but did not attack the strong prince because he still had a dagger. The following day, Abaffy told Gabriel that the troops from Royal Hungary wanted to see him. After visiting Abaffy's army, Gabriel returned to V\u00e1rad in a carriage. Horsemen suddenly attacked the carriage, forcing it to turn into a narrow street. Gabriel jumped out of the carriage, but was soon shot. He tried to resist at a willow tree near the Pece Stream , but dozens of Hajd\u00fas attacked and killed him. Hajd\u00fa infantry captain Bal\u00e1zs Nagy brought Gabriel's body first to Nagyecsed, and then to Ny\u00edrb\u00e1tor . His body lay unburied in the crypt of the church in Ny\u00edrb\u00e1tor, and he was ceremoniously buried at Bethlen's order only in 1628. Transylvania went through a chaotic period during Gabriel's rule. Historian Katalin P\u00e9ter states that Gabriel \"was not the man to tolerate inaction for long\" and \"ruled with extravagance and capricious irresponsibility\". Gabriel, according to P\u00e9ter, was unable to keep a balance among the different groups of the Transylvanian nobility, which gave rise to new tensions between Calvinists and Catholics, natives and newcomers, pro-Habsburg and pro-Ottoman politicians. Neither could he realize that the Ottoman Empire had recovered after the Long Turkish War by the time he ascended the throne and his expansionist ambitions were not tolerated by the Sultan. Historian L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nagy's evaluation of B\u00e1thory's rule is different. He says that B\u00e1thory's bad fame can be traced back to the works of historians who worked in the court of Gabriel Bethlen who made conscious efforts to denigrate his predecessor. Nagy also emphasizes that 17th-century popular literary works show that many commoners was mourning B\u00e1thory's death. The 20th-century Hungarian novelist Zsigmond M\u00f3ricz characterizes Gabriel B\u00e1thory as a \"true fairy prince\", adding that \"fairies are unfit for this world\". Family Gabriel's wife, Anna, was the daughter of Gy\u00f6rgy Horv\u00e1th Palocsai and Krisztina Sulyok. According to Nagy Szab\u00f3, she was \"a big fat woman\" and Gabriel \"did possibly not love her too much\". Michael Weiss said that Gabriel's separation from his wife was a reason for the Saxons' rebellion because it contradicted divine law. Bethlen accused Gabriel of an incestuous affair with his sister, Anna, first mentioning the rumour in Istanbul in 1613 in an attempt to depose him. The accusation was repeated during a secret lawsuit against Anna, whom Bethlen accused of witchcraft in 1614.

{"id": "doc_fixed_042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Horowitz", "text": "Noah Horowitz (born 1979) is an American art historian and the CEO of Art Basel since 2022. Horowitz was previously at Sotheby\u2019s as Worldwide Head of Gallery & Private Dealer Services, and held the post of Director Americas at Art Basel from 2015 to 2021. He has a Ph.D. in art history from the Courtauld Institute of Art in London and is the author of Art of the Deal: Contemporary Art in a Global Financial Market, published by Princeton University Press in 2011 and released as a paperback in 2014. Career Horowitz was born in Princeton, New Jersey in 1979. He graduated from The Lawrenceville School in 1998 and in 2002 received a B.A. degree in Art History with Economics from the University of Virginia , where he was an Echols Scholar. He continued on at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London for his M.A. (2003) and Ph.D. degrees (2006). While finishing the doctorate, Horowitz worked as an associate at the Serpentine Gallery in London where he was mentored by its co-director Hans Ulrich Obrist . He moved to New York in 2010 and joined the team behind the first online-only art fair, VIP. The following year, he was hired as the Managing Director of The Armory Show in New York and became its overall head in 2012. Horowitz is widely credited with revitalizing the art fair, which had been losing gallery participation in the years leading up to his hire. In July 2015, Art Basel , led by Marc Spiegler , announced they had hired Horowitz as its Director Americas, putting him in charge of Art Basel\u2019s annual December edition in Miami Beach. \u00a0Horowitz oversaw the transformation of the Miami fair and firmly established Art Basel\u2019s presence in the United States and New York more broadly. His initiatives included the launch of the Global Art Market report, written by the economist Clare McAndrew. In 2021, Horowitz moved to Sotheby\u2019s , taking on the newly created position of Worldwide Head of Gallery & Private Dealer Services. During his tenure, Horowitz founded Artist\u2019s Choice, a new sale that enables artists to consign work directly to auction. Horowitz returned to Art Basel as CEO in November 2022, succeeding Global Director Marc Spiegler . Other roles Horowitz has written and lectured widely on art and economics. His texts and commentary have appeared in publications including The New York Times , Financial Times , Texte zur Kunst and The Art Newspaper . His book, Art of the Deal: Contemporary Art in a Global Financial Market, was published by Princeton University Press in 2011 and released as a paperback in 2014. Personal life Horowitz lives in Brooklyn, New York. He is married to fellow art historian Louise Sorensen and together they have two kids.

Biden's father had once led an affluent life, but suffered financial setbacks soon after Biden was born, and for several years the family lived with Biden's maternal grandparents. Beginning in 1953, the family lived in an apartment in Claymont, Delaware , before moving to a house in Mayfield, Delaware . Biden's father later became a successful used-car salesman, maintaining the family in a middle-class lifestyle. At Archmere Academy , the later 46th president Joe Biden himself was class president of his junior and senior high school classes, and graduated from Archmere in 1961. At the University of Delaware , Biden earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965 with a double major in history and political science . In 1966, Biden married Neilia Hunter , a student at Syracuse University . They had three children: Beau , Robert Hunter , and Naomi Christina \"Amy\". In 1968, Biden earned a Juris Doctor degree from the university's College of Law , ranked 76th in his class of 85 students. He was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969 and practiced as a lawyer before running for political office. On December 18, 1972, Biden's wife and daughter died in a car crash. He came close to resigning from the U.S. Senate , to which he had recently been elected for the first time that year. Nearly five years later, Biden married Jill Jacobs \u2014they have one daughter together, Ashley . Early life and education Heritage and childhood See also: Family of Joe Biden Sign at the childhood home of Joe Biden in Scranton Biden was born on November 20, 1942, at St. Mary's Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania , to Catherine Eugenia \"Jean\" Biden n\u00e9e Finnegan (1917-2010) and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr (1915-2002). He was the first of four siblings in a Catholic family, with a sister, Valerie (1945), and two brothers, James (1949) and Francis (1953), following. Biden's mother was of Irish descent, with roots variously attributed to County Louth or County Londonderry , while his father had English , French , and Irish ancestry. His maternal great-grandfather, Edward Francis Blewitt , was a Pennsylvania state senator . His maternal grandfather was a graduate of Santa Clara University in California, where he was \"an acclaimed quarterback\" before returning to Scranton to work for local oil and gas companies, then as a newspaper librarian for the remainder of his career. Biden's father led an affluent lifestyle as a young adult, \"sailing yachts off the New England coast, riding to the hounds, driving fast cars, flying airplanes\" while working as an executive for, and experiencing the largess of, the Sheen Company. The Sheen Company was founded and owned by Bill Sheen, Biden's paternal great-uncle. Bill Sheen had invented a material that he then manufactured as lining for cemetery vaults. He subsequently secured a number of US government contracts to make water-tight sealant for merchant marine ships during World War II and renamed the family business to Sheen Armor Company. Early in Biden's life, the family relocated to a \"four-bedroom Dutch colonial in a Boston suburb, with plenty of money and perks to fly back to Scranton to visit the Finnegans whenever they wanted\" so that Joe Sr. could run Sheen Company's branch office in Boston; Biden's sister, Valerie was born there in 1945. Joe Sr. and his cousin, Bill Sheen Jr., were close friends. After the war was over, the business failed, and several attempts by Biden Sr. and Sheen Jr. to start a business together faltered. Jean Biden took their children back to Scranton in 1948, and Biden Sr. soon followed. For several years, the family had to live with Biden's maternal grandparents, the Finnegans. Biden Jr. attended St. Paul's School, a Catholic primary school in Scranton. He made several lifelong friends in Scranton, who describe \"file drawers full of memories\" of childhood antics and escapades. When the Scranton area fell into economic decline during the 1950s, Biden's father could not find steady work. In 1953, the Biden family moved into an apartment in Claymont, Delaware . The next year, the Bidens relocated to the Village of Arden , an art colony. The year after that, they moved to Mayfield , a neighborhood in Wilmington, Delaware . Joe Biden Sr. became a successful used car salesman , and the family's circumstances were middle class. Biden Jr. attended two more Catholic primary schools: Holy Rosary School in Claymont and then St. Helena's Elementary School in Wilmington. At several times during his youth, Biden considered becoming a priest. High school Biden while a student at Archmere Academy in the 1950s Biden attended the Archmere Academy in Claymont where he was a standout halfback / wide receiver on the high school football team. Scoring ten touchdowns, he helped lead a perennially losing team to an undefeated season in his senior year. His coach, who would be inducted into the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame , subsequently said of Biden, \"He was a skinny kid, but he was one of the best pass receivers I had in 16 years as a coach.\" Biden played as an outfielder on the school's baseball team as well, becoming a starter in his senior year albeit batting in the bottom half of the order . From an early age, Biden had been afflicted by a severe stutter , which often brought teasing from other children and embarrassment with teachers. Excelling in sports was especially important to Biden as it gave him a way of gaining social acceptance despite his speech issue. While not a major participant in the ongoing civil rights movement , he did walk out of a restaurant that refused to serve a football teammate of his who was black. Academically, Biden was a 'B' (above-average) student at Archmere, was considered a natural leader among his classmates, and was elected class president during his junior and senior years. He graduated in 1961. College Biden attended the University of Delaware in Newark , where he was more interested in sports and socializing than in studying, although his classmates were impressed by his cramming abilities. He played halfback with the \"Blue Chicks\" freshman football team (at the time, freshmen were not eligible to play varsity sports). However, when he got a poor 1.9 grade point average for the semester, his parents told him that he had to give up football to concentrate on his classes. He continued to get mostly \"C\" and \"D\" grades for his next two semesters. His grades then began to improve, but never became especially good. He wanted to return to the football field, and by the spring practices of his junior year he thought he was about to earn a starting spot as a defensive back on the varsity for that fall. In 1964, while on spring break in the Bahamas , he met and began dating Neilia Hunter , who was from an affluent background in Skaneateles, New York , and attended Syracuse University . He told her that he aimed to become a senator by the age of 30 and then president. He dropped his plan to play for the varsity football team, enabling him to spend more time visiting out of state with her. He earned his bachelor's in 1965 from the University of Delaware, with a double major in history and political science and a minor in English . He had a \"C\" average overall for his four years, graduating with a class rank of 506 out of 688. Law school Biden in the Syracuse 1968 yearbook Biden then entered the Syracuse University College of Law , chosen in part because it would put him near Neilia Hunter. He received a half scholarship based on financial need with some additional assistance based on academics. By his own description, he found law school to be \"the biggest bore in the world\" and he said he pulled many all-nighters to get by. He relied on the notes of other students for classes that he skipped as well as help from Neilia Hunter in studying. He participated in football and rugby at the collegiate club level and ran for class president, losing by one vote to future financial marketplace executive William J. Brodsky . To date, Brodsky is the only person to ever beat Biden in a head-to-head election. During his first year there, Biden submitted a fifteen-page paper for a legal methods course that was found to have contained academic plagiarism of five pages of a recently published article in the Fordham Law Review . A report from the law school faculty said that Biden should be failed in the course as a result; in response, Biden said the copying was inadvertent due to his not knowing the proper rules of citation. Such mistakes were not uncommon among first-year students still learning the requirements of attribution. Biden was permitted to retake the course after receiving a failing \"F\" grade, which was subsequently dropped from his record. Overall, evaluations from Biden's professors were mixed, but Biden's grades were such that he was consistently near the bottom of his class the entire time he was in the school. One professor later said that Biden had done very well in a legislation course and that \"I had the impression this was a young man who was going to do well and go a long way,\" while another professor later said of Biden, \"He was one of the great successes after law school, but not in law school. It happens all the time.\" Biden received his Juris Doctor in 1968, graduating 76th of 85 in his class. He was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969. Other experiences Negative impressions of drinking alcohol in the Biden and Finnegan families and in the neighborhood led to Biden becoming a teetotaler . Having suffered from stuttering through much of his childhood and into his twenties, he has said that he finally overcame it by spending many hours reciting poetry in front of a mirror. During the early 1960s, Biden participated in a demonstration against the last remaining segregated theater in Wilmington. Some sources have also described Biden participating in a protest while he was still in high school, against the Towne Theatre. During the summer of 1962, while in college, Biden worked as the only white lifeguard at a swimming pool in a black neighborhood of Wilmington, an experience which he later credited with expanding his thinking regarding racial issues. Later in life, Biden repeatedly told a story that, while working at the pool, he confronted a man nicknamed \"Corn Pop\", the leader of a gang called the Romans, persuading the man to walk away from a potential fight by apologizing to him. While considered outlandish or bizarre by some commentators, various lifelong Delawareans and contemporary newspaper articles confirmed the broad outlines of Biden's story, identifying his antagonist as a man named William \"Corn Pop\" Morris. Draft Regarding the U.S. military draft , Biden received five \"2-S\" student deferments during this period, with the first coming in late 1963 and the last in early 1968 at the peak of the Vietnam War . Student deferments such as the ones Biden received were given out routinely during this period. In April 1968, he received a draft notice as he was about to graduate from law school; but after a medical examination he was reclassified by the Selective Service System as \"1-Y\", not available for service except in national emergency, due to having had asthma as a teenager. The notion that Biden suffered from asthma has been questioned by some observers, given his past participation in football and other sports and his having appeared healthy in the time leading up to his examination. Some sources report that Biden's 2007 memoir, Promises to Keep , never mentions asthma; but he does briefly mention having had \"childhood asthma\" in a passage in the book describing his health during and after his 1988 presidential campaign. Young men looking to avoid active-duty military service was common during the Vietnam War. Other figures from the era who would go on to become national leaders also received similar numbers of student deferments or non-obvious medical exemptions. Biden was generally supportive of the war during much of this time, and never took part in anti-war demonstrations , later saying that at the time he was preoccupied with marriage and law school, and \"wore sports coats ... not tie-dyed\". Early political career and family life On August 27, 1966, while Biden was still a law student, he married Neilia Hunter. They overcame her Presbyterian parents' initial reluctance for her to wed a Roman Catholic, and the ceremony was held in a Catholic church in Skaneateles . The couple had three children, Joseph R. \"Beau\" Biden III in 1969, Robert Hunter in 1970, and Naomi Christina in 1971. During 1968, Biden clerked for six months at a law firm headed by prominent local Republican William Prickett and, as he later said, \"thought of myself as a Republican\". He disliked the conservative racial politics of incumbent Democratic Governor of Delaware Charles L. Terry and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson , who defeated Terry in 1968. The local Republicans tried to recruit him, but he resisted due to his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon , and registered as an Independent instead. In 1969, Biden resumed practicing law, first as a public defender in Wilmington, Delaware . Most of his clients were African Americans from Wilmington's east side. Biden's time as a public defender was short, but several of his cases attracted newspaper coverage, including his defenses of a fisherman accused of stealing a cow (sentenced to no jail time), and a 15-year-old charged with drug possession (acquitted). Biden later described the job in his memoir as \"God's work\", but also wrote that \"God's work wasn't full time work in 1969\". Biden then joined a firm headed by Sid Balick, a locally active Democrat. Balick named him to the Democratic Forum, a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party, and Biden switched his registration to Democratic. He also started his own firm, Biden and Walsh. Corporate law , however, did not appeal to him and criminal law did not pay well. He supplemented his income by managing properties. Later in 1969, Biden ran as a Democrat for the New Castle County Council on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburban area. He won by a solid, two-thousand vote margin in the usually Republican district and in a bad year for Democrats in the state. Even before taking his seat, he was already talking about running for the U.S. Senate in a couple of years. He served on the County Council from 1970 to 1972 while continuing his private law practice. Biden represented the 4th district on the county council. Among issues he addressed on the council was his opposition to large highway projects that might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods, including those related to Interstate 95 . 1972 U.S. Senate campaign Biden's entry into the 1972 U.S. Senate election in Delaware presented a unique circumstance. Longtime Delaware political figure and Republican incumbent Senator J. Caleb Boggs was considering retirement, which would likely have left U.S. Representative Pete du Pont and Wilmington Mayor Harry G. Haskell Jr. in a divisive primary fight. To avoid that, U.S. president Richard Nixon helped convince Boggs to run again with full party support. No other Democrat wanted to run against Boggs. Biden's campaign had virtually no money and was given no chance of winning. It was managed by his sister Valerie Biden Owens (who would go on to manage his future campaigns) and staffed by other family members, and relied upon handed-out newsprint position papers and meeting voters face-to-face; the small size of the state and lack of a major media market made the approach feasible. He did receive some assistance from the AFL\u2013CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell . His campaign issues focused on withdrawal from Vietnam, the environment, civil rights, mass transit, more equitable taxation, health care, the public's dissatisfaction with politics-as-usual, and \"change\". During the summer, he trailed by almost 30\u00a0percentage points, but his energy level, his attractive young family, and his ability to connect with voters' emotions gave the surging Biden an advantage over the ready-to-retire Boggs. He won the November 7, 1972 election in an upset by a margin of 3,162 votes. Death of wife and daughter On December 18, 1972, a few weeks after the election, Biden's wife and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident while Christmas shopping in Hockessin, Delaware . Neilia Biden's station wagon was hit by a tractor-trailer truck as she pulled out from an intersection, possibly because her head was turned and she did not see the other vehicle; the truck swerved and overturned in an attempt to avoid the collision. Within a couple of days of the accident, a Delaware chief deputy attorney general, Jerome O. Herlihy, announced that the truck driver had been cleared of any wrongdoing in it. Biden's sons Beau and Hunter survived the accident and were taken to the hospital in fair condition, Beau with a broken leg and other wounds, and Hunter with a minor skull fracture and other head injuries. Doctors soon said both would make full recoveries. Biden considered resigning to care for them, saying that the people of Delaware \"can always get another senator\" but that his children \"can't get another father,\" but was persuaded not to by Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield . In later years, Biden said on several occasions that the truck driver had been drinking alcohol before the collision, and several media outlets reported this as fact. The driver died in 1999, but his daughter sought to have his name again cleared and to get an apology from Biden. By this time, the police records regarding the accident had been lost, but the accident investigator Herlihy, who had become a Delaware Superior Court judge, reiterated that \"The rumor about alcohol being involved by either party, especially the truck driver, is incorrect.\" Subsequently, a Biden spokesperson said that Biden \"fully accepts the [driver's] family's word that these rumors were false.\" Biden called the driver's daughter to apologize personally, which she accepted. Senate and recovery See also: United States Senate career of Joe Biden Entering the Senate Biden was sworn into office on January 5, 1973, by Francis R. Valeo , the secretary of the Senate , in a small chapel at the Delaware Division of the Wilmington Medical Center . Beau was wheeled in with his leg still in traction; Hunter, who had already been released, was also there, as were other members of the extended family. Witnesses and television cameras were also present and the event received national attention. At age 30 (the minimum age required to hold the office), Biden became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history, and one of only 18 senators who took office before reaching the age of 31. But the accident had left him filled with both anger and religious doubt: \"I liked to [walk around seedy neighborhoods] at night when I thought there was a better chance of finding a fight ... I had not known I was capable of such rage ... I felt God had played a horrible trick on me.\" To be at home every day for his young sons, Biden began the practice of commuting every day by Amtrak train for 90 minutes each way from his home in the Wilmington suburbs to Washington, D.C., which he continued to do throughout his Senate career. In the aftermath of the accident, he had trouble focusing on work and appeared to just go through the motions of being a senator. In his memoirs, Biden notes that staffers were taking bets on how long he would last. A single father for five years, he left standing orders that he be interrupted in the Senate at any time if his sons called. In remembrance of his wife and daughter, Biden does not work on December 18, the anniversary of the accident. Nonetheless, during these first years in the Senate, Biden focused on consumer protection and environmental issues and called for greater government accountability. He supported legislation dedicated to campaign finance reform , reflecting that during his senate election, offers of campaign funds in implicit return for future favors had been tempting in light of his lack of personal wealth. In mid-1974, Time magazine named Biden as one of the 200 Faces for the Future in a profile that mentioned what had happened to his family, calling him \"self-confident\" and \"compulsively ambitious\". Recovery and second marriage Biden and his second wife, Jill , met in 1975 and married in 1977. By 1974, Biden had begun dating again, while avoiding marriage in the belief it would be unfair to his partner\u2014he described himself to a reporter as \"still in love with his wife\". However, in 1975, Biden met Jill Tracy Jacobs , who had grown up in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania , and become a teacher in Delaware. They met on a blind date arranged by Biden's brother, although it turned out that Biden had already noticed a photograph of her in an advertisement for a local park in Wilmington, Delaware . Biden would credit her with renewing his interest in both politics and life. He proposed marriage to her several times before she accepted; she was wary of entering the public spotlight, anxious to remain focused on her own career, and initially hesitant to take on the commitment of raising his two young sons who had survived the accident. On June 17, 1977, Biden and Jacobs were married by a Catholic priest at the Chapel at the United Nations in New York City. They spent their honeymoon at Lake Balaton in the Hungarian People's Republic , behind the Iron Curtain ; the destination was chosen upon the recommendation of Hungarian-born Biden staffer Tom Lantos . Joe and Jill Biden have one daughter together, Ashley Blazer (born 1981), and regularly attend Mass at St. Joseph's on the Brandywine in Greenville, Delaware . References Footnotes ^ Biden has been defeated in some presidential primary and caucus contests. ^ This incident would attract attention in 1987 when further plagiarism accusations emerged during his 1988 presidential campaign; some exaggerations and inaccurate statements that Biden had made regarding his college and law school accomplishments also became an issue, causing Biden to release transcripts and other documents from both schools.

{"id": "doc_fixed_052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_H._West", "text": "For others of the same name, see Francis West (disambiguation) . Francis Henry West (October 25, 1825\u00a0\u2013 March 6, 1896) was an American businessman, politician, and Wisconsin pioneer. He was a member of the Wisconsin Legislature for three years, and served as a Union Army officer during the American Civil War , earning an honorary brevet to brigadier general. Early life and career West was born in Charlestown, New Hampshire . He moved to the Wisconsin Territory in 1845, eventually settling in Monroe , in Green County , in 1846. In Green County, he worked in the lumber industry. In 1853, he was elected as a Democrat to represent Green County in the Wisconsin State Senate for the 1854 and 1855 sessions. In 1855, he was the Republican nominee for Bank Comptroller, but was not successful. In 1859 and 1860, he accompanied parties of migrants from New York to California. Civil War West joined the Army on August 28, 1862, and was commissioned a lieutenant colonel with the 31st Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment , which was still being organized in Wisconsin. The 31st Wisconsin was created from two volunteer battalions from Crawford County and Racine . The 31st mustered into service in October 1862 and left Wisconsin in March 1863. Kentucky and Tennessee The 31st traveled to Kentucky via Cairo, Illinois , and was attached to the XVI Army Corps . They spent the summer of 1863 on patrols and picket duty in southern Illinois, western Kentucky, protecting supply routes along the Mississippi River . In September 1863, they were ordered to Nashville . Here, their colonel, Isaac E. Messmore , resigned, and, on October 8, Lt. Colonel West was promoted to colonel of the 31st Wisconsin. Through the winter of 1863\u201364, the regiment was stationed at Murfreesboro, Tennessee , and continued to serve as protection for logistics and supplies. In April 1864, the 31st was attached to the XX Corps and split into detachments to protect a long stretch of railroad lines in Tennessee. In June, the regiment was ordered to consolidate and return to Nashville. Georgia On July 5, the 31st Wisconsin was ordered by General William Tecumseh Sherman to proceed to the front of the ongoing Atlanta campaign . The 31st traveled by train to Marietta, Georgia , and reached its position on the line July 21. The regiment worked on constructing siege fortifications around Atlanta and came under frequent enemy fire due to their proximity to the enemy lines. The regiment did not take part in the actual battle, but was one of the first units to enter the city. The regiment was assigned to provide security in the city and protect foraging operations in the surrounding area. On November 15, 1864, the XX Corps broke camp and marched out of the city to begin their part in Sherman's March to the Sea (the Savannah Campaign). They advanced without encountering any resistance until ten miles outside Savannah . There, on December 9, they encountered two small enemy fortifications. The 31st Wisconsin, along with the 61st Ohio , were ordered to flank the position through a thick swamp. They passed the swamp and charged the enemy, taking the position with light casualties. For their action, they received the compliments of General Sherman. The regiment joined the siege of Savannah, and after capturing the city were assigned quarters there. Carolinas On January 18, 1865, the 31st Wisconsin departed Savannah and marched for Purrysburg, South Carolina , at the start of the Carolinas campaign . The regiment proceeded through South Carolina, burning enemy facilities, tearing up railroad tracks, and pushing the enemy's rear guard toward North Carolina. On March 1, the 31st advanced toward Chesterfield, South Carolina , near the border with North Carolina. They forced a small confederate force to flee north, then stopped in the village. On March 16, the 31st took position on the front line for Averasborough , where they were shelled and took casualties. Three days later, they were in the advance on approach to Bentonville , along with two other regiments, where they encountered significant Confederate opposition and found their flanks exposed. They fell back and formed a defensive position with elements of the XIV and XX Corps. The Confederates attacked their position five times and were repelled in fierce fighting. This was the worst fighting that they saw during the war, and suffered ten killed and forty-two wounded. On March 24, they reached Goldsboro, North Carolina , where they stopped to rest and re-equip. While the 31st was camped at Goldsboro, Ulysses S. Grant accepted the surrender of Robert E. Lee at Appomatox . On April 10, the 31st marched out to continue their advance toward Raleigh , pursuing Joseph E. Johnston and the remnants of the Army of the South . But before they reached Raleigh, they received word that Johnston had surrendered to Sherman and the war was effectively over. The 31st was ordered back to Washington, where they participated in the Grand Review of the Armies in May, and West mustered out on June 20, 1865. While in Washington, U.S. President Andrew Johnson nominated Colonel West for an honorary brevet to brigadier general of volunteers for gallant service in the field, effective back to March 19, 1865, the day of their combat at Bentonville. The United States Senate confirmed the brevet on March 12, 1866. Postbellum years After the war, General West moved to Milwaukee County and entered a partnership\u2014Fowler & West\u2014with James S. Fowler in the grain commission business. He served for six years on the board of directors of the Milwaukee Chamber of Commerce, including two years as president. In 1873, he was elected on the Reform ticket to represent Northern Milwaukee County in the Wisconsin State Assembly for the 1874 session. The Reform Party was a short-lived coalition of Democrats, reformers, Liberal Republicans , and Grangers . Their signature accomplishment was the 1874 \" Potter Law ,\" 1874 Wisconsin Act 273 \u2014named for Republican state senator Robert L. D. Potter \u2014which established a new state Railroad Commission to aggressively regulate railroad and freight fees. In the Assembly, Colonel West served on the Committee on Railroads and the Committee on State Affairs. General West did not seek re-election in 1874. During Grover Cleveland 's first presidential term, West was appointed United States Marshal for the Milwaukee district. After completing this final public service, Colonel West retired to Alabama, where two of his sons lived. While on a trip to New York, in 1896, West slipped while attempting to step off of a street car and was severely injured. He was confined to his bed for several days before he was healthy enough to return to Alabama. He died a few weeks later, on March 6, 1896, at Bessemer, Alabama . He was buried at Forest Home Cemetery , in Milwaukee. Personal life and family Francis H. West was the second of four children born to Enoch Hammond West and his wife Lydia ( n\u00e9e Fitch). Both of Francis's brothers, Frederick and Charles, also came to Green County, Wisconsin, and were active in local politics. The West family were descended from Francis West, a carpenter who came to Massachusetts Bay Colony from England in the 1630s. Francis West married Emma Moore Rittenhouse in June 1849. They had at least eight children together, though at least one died young. His former home at Monroe, Wisconsin, now known as the General Francis H. West House , is listed on the National Register of Historic Places .

The A1 motorway crosses the territory of the settlement north of the village. The area is part of the traditional region of Styria . The municipality is now included in the Savinja Statistical Region . Name Arja Vas was attested in written sources in 1368 as Bernstorf (and as Wernstorf in 1428, Bernsdorff in 1441, and Wernsdorff in 1454). The name in modern German was Arndorf , and in the local dialect the settlement is known as Vrja ves . Based on the local name and the medieval transcriptions, the name is based on an adjective form of the personal name *Var or *Varo , thus originally meaning 'Var(o)'s village'. The initial Slovene V- and German W- was lost because it was reanalyzed as the Slovene preposition v 'in'. Shrine The village chapel-shrine dates to the early 20th century and was renovated in 2008.

{"id": "doc_fixed_064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft_Legends", "text": "Minecraft Legends is a 2023 real-time action - strategy video game developed by Mojang Studios and Blackbird Interactive and published by Xbox Game Studios . A spin-off of the 2011 sandbox game Minecraft , it was released on Windows , Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , and Xbox Series X/S on April 18, 2023. The game would later cease development on January 10, 2024. The goal of the game is to defend the Overworld from an invasion of piglins, pig-like humanoid creatures from the Nether dimension, while the player gradually strengthens their structures and troops with resources harvested. The game received mixed reviews from critics, with its gameplay being both praised for its execution and criticized for its repetitive nature. Gameplay Minecraft Legends is set in the Minecraft Overworld, an earth-like dimension filled with various biomes and natural resources that is currently under attack from the piglin hordes from the Nether dimension. The Overworld contains friendly villages, hostile piglin outposts, and the Well of Fate (the player spawnpoint and fast-travel hub). Similarly to Minecraft , the Overworld is procedurally generated, resulting in a unique world for each playthrough of the game. Players collect resources to construct defenses, upgrade buildings, and summon troops. Players collect basic resources such as wood and stone by assigning friendly Allays to harvest them from deposits found in the Overworld. Other resources, such as redstone and lapis lazuli are used to build advanced structures and summon stronger troops but are locked behind Well of Fate upgrades. Prismarine, which is needed to construct some buildings, can only be collected by defeating piglin structures. The player can use resources they've collected to construct buildings and upgrade the Well of Fate. Defensive fortifications such as walls and turrets protect friendly villages and player outposts. Spawners summon friendly troops the players can recruit into their army. Offensive structures such as the redstone cannon, hurl explosive shells at targets from long range. Upgrading the Well of Fate unlocks more advanced buildings and troops. The primary goal of combat is to destroy piglin outposts and defend friendly villages from periodic piglin raids. Players use their summoned troops to assault and destroy piglin outposts. Players travel around the Overworld on their mount, from which they can issue various orders command their army on the battlefield. These commands include orders to rally, halt, and charge. Players can also use their sword to attack enemies directly. Players build their army by constructing spawner buildings that summon troops or recruiting troops from camps found throughout the Overworld. Minecraft Legends incorporates the same Minecoins currency as Minecraft Bedrock Edition . This currency is used to purchase additional skins and mounts within the game. The game is sold with an optional \"Deluxe Skin Pack\", which contains six additional in-game skins: one hero skin and five mount skins. Plot The game begins with the player mining in a cave when they are greeted by three beings: Action, Knowledge, and Foresight. These beings are called Hosts, caretakers of the Overworld. These three persuade the player to help them save their world, where a war has broken out between the Nether and the Overworld. The player is then transported to that world. After completing a tutorial, the player must save a few villages from being invaded by piglins from the Nether. Then, the player destroys three nether outposts that are preparing to invade villages. Subsequently, the player destroys nine Nether portals from three different world areas. In each of these three areas, the player has to defeat a piglin boss: \"the Devourer,\" \"the Beast,\" and \"the Unbreakable\". Once the player destroys all of the portals and defeats all of the bosses, the player fights the final boss: \"the Great Hog.\" Just as the player defeats the Great Hog, it makes a last attempt at destroying the Well of Fate. This backfires and its army is swallowed by a portal that sends them back to the Nether. Then, the Great Hog finally dies. After the battle, there is a grand celebration in the Overworld of their win over the piglins. Not all is well, however. The warrior villagers, who fought alongside the hero, resent the pacifistic villagers who did not, which causes a rift between the two groups. In addition to this, the Hosts have left the world to the Hero's responsibility and moved on. Development Minecraft Legends began development in 2018. The game was announced during the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase on June 12, 2022. After the show, a trailer on the Minecraft YouTube channel confirmed additional platforms. It is developed by series creators Mojang Studios in collaboration with Blackbird Interactive , a team founded by former Relic Entertainment employees, who are best known for developing the real-time strategy video game series Homeworld . After the success of Minecraft Dungeons , another spin-off of Minecraft , Minecraft Legends was released on April 18, 2023. It was made available to play on Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 5 , PlayStation 4 , Steam , Windows 11|10, PC Game Pass, Xbox Game Pass , Xbox Series X/S , Xbox One , and Xbox Cloud Gaming . On January 10, 2024, Mojang announced that no more updates will be released for Minecraft Legends . Reception Reception Reception of the game was generally mixed. According to the review aggregator Metacritic , Minecraft Legends received \"mixed or average\" reviews. Critics viewed the game as a solid addition to the Minecraft franchise but offered differing opinions on its execution. Destructoid writer Timothy Monbleau expressed newfound appreciation for both Minecraft and the strategy genre after playing the game, while Sarah Thwaites of Game Informer described the game as feeling \"caught between the expected complexity of strategy games and the franchise\u2019s approachable brand.\" Critics generally found the gameplay fun but repetitive and lacking in depth. They praised the game for its Minecraft -themed art style, resource gathering mechanics, and base-building gameplay. Critics also liked the multiplayer co-op and PvP modes. Some reviewers criticized the game's lack of strategic depth, poor AI, and tedious gameplay.

Activities Wagensveld has been the leader of Pegida Netherlands since November 2014, at a time when he owned a small internet-based business selling non-lethal weapons, self-defence articles and outdoors products. He had previously that year participated in a Hogesa demonstration. He lives in Germany close to the Dutch border, and commutes to the Netherlands to stage demonstrations, and is a staunch supporter of Geert Wilders . In 2016, he was revealed to have been patrolling for refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey with Tatjana Festerling . In April 2018, Wagensveld was sentenced to two years and nine months in prison for tax evasion . He was investigated by Dutch police for tearing out pages of the Quran and calling it a \"fascist book\" in January 2023 in front of the Dutch parliament building. His desecrations of the Quran contributed to the diplomatic Quran crisis that year. In August, he trampled on and tore up a Quran outside the Turkish embassy in The Hague. During his subsequent trial in November, he tore apart another copy of the Quran. He was sentenced to forty hours of community service. In January 2024, he was violently attacked during a demonstration in Arnhem after he tried to burn a Quran. In March, he was arrested in Arnhem for pulling a Quran on a dog leash.

Born in Kenya to missionary parents, Miller was primarily raised in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania . He ran track, cross country, and played American soccer in high school. He continued to run at Rochester Institute of Technology while studying electrical engineering . After college Miller worked in the print shop on the Queen Mary 2 cruise ship, and trained for running on a treadmill, the ship's stairwells, and at ports of call. After his win of the JFK 50 Mile in 2013 with the third fastest time in course history, he turned pro while continuing his cruise ship work. In 2015, his win of Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc's 105 kilometres (65\u00a0mi) Courmayeur-Champex-Chamonix (CCC) was the first American win of that race. After his cruise work Miller was the resident caretaker at Barr Camp near Manitou Springs, Colorado for five years, which provided the opportunity to live and train at altitude on the Barr Trail and nearby Pikes Peak . After Barr Camp, Miller's primary residence became a converted school bus . After a three-year break to recover from Haglund's syndrome , Miller returned to racing in 2023. He became one of only a few American men to podium at the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc 105 mile race, after coming in second to overall winner Jim Walmsley . Notable race results Miller has won or had a top three finish at a number of the most competitive ultramarathons in the world.

The original venue opened in 1984, and a major redevelopment and expansion was completed in 2023. The centre now has two Olympic size (60\u00a0m \u00d7 30\u00a0m) ice rinks . It is owned by the Lee Valley Regional Park Authority , and is home to the Lee Valley Lions ice hockey team. History The ice centre was opened in 1984 by Torvill and Dean . By the 2010s the centre was aging and unable to cope with demand, and a redevelopment was proposed. There was some opposition from environmental groups due to the impact on Leyton Marsh , but the plans were approved by Waltham Forest council. The \u00a330\u00a0million redevelopment was funded by the Lee Valley Regional Park Authority and the London Borough of Waltham Forest , and added a gym, dance studio and cafe together with the new ice rinks. Robin Cousins , Olympic gold medal winning figure skater and president of British Ice Skating , took part in a \"soft-launch\" event, before the centre opened to the public on Saturday 17 June. Ice hockey The Lee Valley Ice Centre is home to the Lee Valley Lions , an amateur side competing in the English National Ice Hockey League . It used to also be home to the London Racers , who competed in the top-level British Elite Ice Hockey League . The Racers controversially withdrew from the league in 2005 after the club claimed that the rink was not safe enough for \"elite\" level ice hockey, although this was challenged by the park authority. Other clubs playing at the centre include the London Devils, and Eastern Stars IHC. The Lee Valley Vampires entered the Women's National Ice Hockey League in 2024, the first ever league women's club to play at Lee Valley. Additional information The music video for \"Sugar Coated Iceberg\" by The Lightning Seeds , which featured on their 1996 album Dizzy Heights , was filmed inside Lee Valley Ice Centre. Dancing on Ice rehearsals are also occasionally filmed inside Lee Valley Ice Centre. References ^ \"Facilities at Lee Valley Ice Centre\" . Better .

{"id": "doc_fixed_071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Everett-Green", "text": "Evelyn Ward Everett-Green (17 November 1856 in London \u2013 23 April 1932 in Funchal) was an English novelist who started with improving, pious stories for children, moved on to historical fiction for older girls, and then turned to adult romantic fiction. She wrote about 350 books, more than 200 of them under her own name, and others using the pseudonyms H. F. E. , Cecil Adair , E. Ward and Evelyn Dare . Early life and work Evelyn was born at 7 Upper Gower Street, London . Her mother was a historian, Mary Anne Everett Green (n\u00e9e Wood), and her father, George Pycock Green, a portrait and landscape painter. The family were Methodists . She was the second of the family's three surviving daughters and had an older brother. She was baptised at Great Queen Street Wesleyan Methodist Chapel on 22 February 1857 as Eveline, but changed her name to Evelyn in later life. Like the rest of her family, she added Everett to her surname in honour of George Green's friend the Wesleyan historian James Everett . From earliest childhood, Evelyn invented stories to tell her sisters. She was educated at home until the age of 12, then at Gower Street Preparatory School , where she wrote a historical tale about Lady Jane Grey . Next came a year at Bedford College, London on a Reid scholarship (1872\u20131873), during which she wrote Tom's Tempest Victory , her first novel. She continued to write while studying at the London Academy of Music . She also worked as a nurse in a London hospital for two years. Her brother's death in 1876 ended plans to go to India with him. She occupied herself with good works, including Sunday School teaching and nursing, and later hospital nursing. Writing career In 1880 Tom Tempest's Victory became her first published work, under the pseudonym H. F. E. Though it was soon followed by other works, she found writing at home difficult and town winters unhealthy for her. In 1881 she was still living in Gower Street with her family, but in 1883 she moved outside London with Catherine Mainwaring Sladen. In the 1890s and early 1900s they had homes in Albury, Surrey . At the time of the 1891 England Census, however, she and Catherine were currently visiting her family at Gower Street. While in Albury, Everett-Green wrote numerous historical novels and somewhat fewer moral tales for the Religious Tract Society . Her novel about Joan of Arc entitled Called of Her Country (1903), later republished as A Heroine of France , presents Joan as a feminine \"Angelic Maid\" in white armour, whose inspiring adventures were undertaken in a dutiful spirit. Many of her works have been dismissed by critics as apologies for an oppressive order. The girls' historical romance genre is viewed by such critics as a validation of \"traditional\", restrictive, domestic-oriented versions of femininity by showing they had long-established historical precedents. Much of Everett-Green's fiction and non-fiction was meant for girls, but she also wrote boys' adventure stories such as A Gordon Highlander (1901). Many of her books followed values and themes learnt during her Methodist upbringing. These are clearest in her books targeting children in general. She soon turned to novels for slightly older girls, the genre she is best remembered for. They generally followed development in a household from childhood to adulthood. Careers for women were mentioned without disapproval, but the endings invariably featured marriage for the female heroines. Contemporary critics, such as one from the Chicago Daily Tribune, said the works were written with \"obvious good intention\", but the \"day of the weepy, fainting, blue-eyed... heroine has vanished.\" Between 1890 and 1909 she wrote about 50 historical tales before moving to Madeira. Thereafter she wrote romantic novels for adults, often under the pseudonym Cecil Adair . According to a modern critic, \"Family sagas or romances with a historical adventure setting were her speciality.\" Contemporary readers enjoyed these for their chaste sensationalism and they had considerable success. She occasionally collaborated with fellow authors Louisa Bedford and Emma and Beatrice Marshall. Evelyn's works were some of the most popular of her generation. She was one of the bestselling authors with her publisher, Stanley Paul. However, while popular enough to bring in adequate income, they lack real distinction and are now generally read for the light they shed on social backgrounds. Later life and death In the 1911 census, Everett-Green, with several servants, is recorded as still living at Albury with Catherine, as \"joint heads\" of the household. In that year, however, Evelyn and Catherine moved abroad and eventually settled in Quinta Pico de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Madeira . However, during the First World War they both lived at Battramsley near Lymington, Hampshire. She and Catherine remained there, financially independent and unmarried. Dominic James has suggested their partnership may have been a romantic one, in line with the same-sex relationship Everett-Green outlined in Fast friends; or, David and Jonathan (1882), which was published under a pseudonym. Evelyn returned to England each year to visit her sister Gertrude and do business with her publishers. She became an active member of the Anglican community in Madeira and was buried in the British Cemetery. There is a memorial plaque on the interior south wall of the English Holy Trinity Church, Funchal. She left a fortune of \u00a35,657. 9s 3d, with the classical scholar A. S. F. Gow administering her will. Later reception An extract from The Mistress of Lydgate Priory (1885): \"For a time I was afraid of her, with that fear that is not unwholesome in the young and has a fascination of its own. I liked to see her come into my room, and was sorry when she left. I liked to watch her from my window as she paced in her stately way to and fro upon the terrace.... My grandmother was herself a reserved and silent woman; moreover, she was imbued with a sound and practical common sense that I have never seen equalled, and which gave her a power and discernment rarely to be met with. Every one came to her for advice, as it seemed to me; and seldom did they go away without having received just such counsel as they most needed. The confidence she inspired was something marvellous, as was the deep and true veneration with which all regarded her.\" The figure represented in this extract exemplifies the recurring theme of a stern and authoritative matriarch seen in the eyes of an adoring and respectful young woman. This theme has led critics to accuse Everett-Green of apologizing for an oppressive order. Indeed her status as a writer for the juvenile female market has led to her works being lumped together as conservative and reactionary by critics such as Kimberley Reynolds. This reading of them became problematic in the 20th century. The idea of girls' literature enforcing traditional forms of femininity comes from later commentators such as E. J. Salmon. This has led to a perception that all literature of this kind was reactionary and conservative. Hillary Skelding has argued that Everett-Green's historical works maintain a high degree of historical accuracy, due to her mother's background as a historian and other female historians of the era. Some of her narratives focus on the unexceptional, everyday women of history who often acknowledge such domestic authority. She depicts in her fictional mothers and wives greater shrewdness and cleverness than her male counterparts did. Conversely, Kimberley Reynolds has noted that some such characters are powerful only within the domestic sphere and do not change the conventional patriarchal order. In effect, she only offers the illusion of female empowerment by limiting it to the domestic sphere. Selected works The Doctor's Dozen (1880) Fast friends; or, David and Jonathan (1882) (as H. F. E.)

Each flower features five petals , two wings , and a keel that resembles the curled beak of a parrot. If the winter season is too cold, too dry, or too rainy, trees may not blossom. History Historically, palash originated in Bihar and Jharkhand . Dhak forests covered much of the Doaba area between the Ganges and the Yamuna rivers, but these were cleared for agriculture in the early 19th century as the English East India Company increased tax demands on the peasants. Use The plant is used to make timber, resin, fodder, medicine, and dye. The wood is dirty white and soft. Being durable under water, it is used for well curbs and water scoops. Spoons and ladles made of its wood are used in various Hindu rituals to pour ghee into the fire. Good charcoal can be obtained from it. Farmers typically plant trees on field bunds and use them to reduce soil erosion. Young shoots are grazed by buffaloes as fodder. The leaves were once used to serve food where plastic plates would be used today. Consumption of Palash Sharbat (a drink made with the plant) is noted in Ayurvedic traditions to help the body endure heat and may support general health. Some modern studies have highlighted its antioxidant content, but robust clinical evidence is currently limited. Fixed oil in the seed and glucoside butrin of the flower sap are considered to be poisonous. Its consumption may cause dizziness , headache, and hypotension . A young cowherd preparing bankh from Butea roots Lac production In India, the tree serves as a crucial host for the lac bug ( Laccifer lacca ), which creates shellac . It produces the most lac sticks per hectare of any lac tree. Leather production The bark produces a crimson exudate that, when dried, hardens into a substance called \" Butea gum \" or \"Bengal kino\". The gum is considered valuable by druggists because of its astringent qualities and by leather workers because of its tannin . Culinary use The gum from the tree, called kamarkas in Hindi , is used in certain food dishes. In Maharashtra state of India it is prepared as a summer beverage out of tea of the flower which is considered to have medicinal benefits. Patravali plate Main article: Patravali In villages of many parts of India, for example in Maharashtra , this tree provides the leaves that are used either with many pieced together or singly (only in case of a banana leaf) to make a leaf-plate for serving a meal. Up until a century ago, a would-be-son-in-law was tested on his dexterity in making this plate and bowl (used to serve daal, gravy dishes) before being declared acceptable by the father-in-law-to-be. Dye The flowers are used to prepare a traditional Holi colour called \"Kesari\". It is also used as a dye for fabric. Butein , a vibrant yellow to deep orange-red dye made from the flowers, is used mostly for dying silk and occasionally for dying cotton. Hindus ink their foreheads with this colour. Literature The plant is known as pal\u0101\u015ba in Sanskrit and is found in Sanskrit texts including the Rigveda and Yajur Veda. The first sloka of the Sukla Yajurveda speaks about the Palasa tree. The Palasa tree branch is cut and trimmed by the Adhvaryu priest who performed the practical part of sacrifice, the day before a new moon or a full moon, and used it to drive the calves away from cows whose milk was to form a part of the offerings for the next day's special ceremony. The flame of the forest is mentioned in the description of the landscape of Punjab in Khushwant Singh 's A History of the Sikhs Vol. 1 . He writes, \"While the margosa is still strewing the earth with its brittle ochre leaves, the silk cotton, the coral and the flame of the forest burst into flowers of bright crimson, red, and orange . \" References to this tree are often found in Punjabi literature. The Punjabi poet Harinder Singh Mehboob employed its symbolism in his poems. In Rudyard Kipling 's short story Beyond the Pale (contained in Plain Tales from the Hills , published in 1888), he says of the dhak: The flower of the dhak means diversely \"desire\", \"come\", \"write\", or \"danger\", according to the other things with it. The tree was also featured in The Jungle Book in the story Tiger! Tiger! as the tree Mowgli instructs his wolf-brother Grey Brother to wait under for a signal that Shere Khan has returned. Cultural associations According to legend, the tree sprang from a falcon's feather that was infused with soma. The right side of Yama's body is where the plant, according to Vayupurana, had its start. This lovely tree is revered by both Hindus and Buddhists . It is said to have used as the tree for achieved enlightenment, or Bodhi by second Lord Buddha Medha\u1e45kara Buddha . In West Bengal , it is associated with spring , especially through the poems and songs of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore , who likened its bright orange flame-like flower to fire. In Santiniketan , where Tagore and Vishalnarayan lived, this flower has become an indispensable part of the celebration of spring. The plant has lent its name to the town of Palashi , famous for the historic Battle of Plassey fought there. In the state of Jharkhand , palash is associated with folk tradition. Many folk literary expressions describe palash as the forest fire. The beauty of dry deciduous forests of Jharkhand reach their height when most trees have shed their leaves and the Palash is in its full bloom. Palash is also the State Flower of Jharkhand. It is said that the tree is a form of Agni , the God of fire and war. In Telangana , these flowers are specially used in the worship of Shiva on occasion of Shivaratri . In Telugu , this tree is called Moduga chettu . In Kerala , it is called plasu , chamata or vishalnarayan . Chamata is the vernacular version of Sanskrit word harinee , small piece of wood that is used for agnihotra or the fire ritual. In most of the old Nambudiri (Kerala Brahmin) houses, one can find this tree because this is widely used for their fire ritual. Tamil Brahmins have a daily agnihotra ritual called Samidha Dhanan , where barks of this tree is a main component for agnihotra, and this ritual is very essential for brahmachari s during the first year of brahmacharya . Palash in full bloom at Ranchi in Jharkhand, India Gita Govinda In Sanskrit, the flower is extensively used as a symbol for the arrival of spring and the colour of love. Jayadeva in the Gita Govinda compares these blossoms to the red nails of Kamadeva or Cupid, with which the latter wounds the hearts of lovers. The imagery is all the more appropriate as the blossoms are compared to a net of kimsuka flowers (\u0915\u093f\u0902\u0936\u0941\u0915\u091c\u093e\u0932\u0947). In a completely leafless tree, the blossoms look like a net. The following stanza is translated by Barbara Stoller Miller ; for kimsuka blossoms, she uses the common name \"flame tree petals\": \u092e\u0943\u0917\u092e\u0926\u0938\u094c\u0930\u092d\u0930\u092d\u0938\u0935\u0936\u0902\u0935\u0926\u0928\u0935\u0926\u0932\u092e\u093e\u0932\u0924\u092e\u093e\u0932\u0947\u0964 \u092f\u0941\u0935\u091c\u0928\u0939\u0943\u0926\u092f\u0935\u093f\u0926\u093e\u0930\u0923\u092e\u0928\u0938\u093f\u091c\u0928\u0916\u0930\u0941\u091a\u093f\u0915\u093f\u0902\u0936\u0941\u0915\u091c\u093e\u0932\u0947\u0965 Tamala tree's fresh leaves absorb strong scent of deer musk.

{"id": "doc_fixed_073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoja", "text": "For the American pornographic actress, see Stoya . Stoja Novakovi\u0107 ( Serbian Cyrillic : \u0421\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0430 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b ; born 4 June 1972), known mononymously as Stoja ( Serbian Cyrillic : \u0421\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0430 ), is a Serbian hardcore-folk singer. Recognised as one of the most popular turbo-folk performers, Stoja is noted for her strong deep voice and often eccentric appearances. She released her first album, Kako je meni sada , in Lazarevi\u0107 Production in 1998. Later, she released her albums in the record label Grand Production . Within a short time, Stoja became one of the most popular singers in the Balkans. She is currently signed to BN Music , and has recently released songs with IDJ and Balkan Star too. Early life Novakovi\u0107 was born on 4 June 1972 in the village of Perlez , in the Zrenjanin , Vojvodina municipality in northern Serbia. Her father Milan was born in Puki\u0161 , a village in the Lopare municipality in northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina , and her mother Katica was from Vojvodina . Stoja has a younger brother \u017divko. She was raised in Perlez, where she lived until the age of 25. When describing her childhood, Stoja said; \u201c We had a hard life, we were poor. I was an energetic girl and caused problems for my parents. I was drawn to do everything I shouldn't. \" According to Stoja, her father had a nice voice and he often sang sevdalinke , and she often listened to him. As a young girl she liked Marina Perazi\u0107 , Bajaga i instruktori , Bijelo Dugme and Madonna . She is said to have received her uncommon and strong voice from her father, Milan, but her talent was discovered by her teacher Sida. Sida, who led the second class, suggested that Stoja should go to a singing competition that was organized for students from the first to fourth grade, as well as to be the first voice of the choir . The competition went well, she won first place, and lived up to teacher Sida's expectations. Her father was not supportive of her singing career and they didn't speak for years because she decided to pursue that career path. It was only after her mother intervened that they reconciled. After finishing elementary school, she enrolled in a commercial high school in Zrenjanin . On third school year, she decided to get married at the age of 16. Career Beginnings (1987-1997) Novakovi\u0107 began singing as an amateur in kafanas and discoth\u00e8ques in 1987. According to her, she started singing accidentally. She went to the local neighbourhood Slava where she sang for the first time. She quotes from that night; \" Tips were flying in all directions, everyone was on tables and chairs. When we finished, the head of the orchestra told me not to go anywhere until we split the tip because I deserved it. My purse was full of money, I couldn't close it. \". The band she sang with, came to her house and propose the idea to her of singing again with them. After her husband died in a car accident, she had to move out of his parents house where she was living with their son, and moved to her friends house. She continued singing, and eventually moved to Novi Sad , then Bor\u010da near Belgrade . One night she was noticed by composer Stevan Simeunovi\u0107 , upon which they started collaborating. In 1997, she began recording an album for the record label Lazarevi\u0107 Production. Kako je meni sada ( How am I doing now ), her debut studio album, was released in 1998, with songs like: Da, da, da ( Yes, yes, yes ) and a duet with Serbian folk singer Mile Kiti\u0107 on the song: Takva je Ljubav ( Such is love ) That first album became a big success. Later that year, she signed with the label Grand Production , owned by Lepa Brena and Sa\u0161a Popovi\u0107 , and released her second album, \u0106iki, \u0107iki in 1999. The album featured multiple hit songs, the biggest being \"\u0106iki, \u0107iki\". The title song \"\u010ciki, \u010diki\" and the track \"Ne\u0107u da ostarim\" ( I\u2019m not going to get old ) gained the greatest popularity. Television appearances followed, which she admits she was not fond of, but interest in her was growing. Despite the stormy year on the political and social front, Stoja performed throughout Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina . Success (2000-2006) She released her second studio album in 2000 under the name Samo ( Only ). It contained eight new songs and four bonus versions from the previous album. The title song \"Samo\" delighted the listeners and experienced greater success than the previous hit. In the same year, Stoja was named folk singer of the year. In 2001, it won the \"Popularity Oscar\" award in the \"best circulation of the year\" category. The album Evropa ( Europe ) was released in 2002, and the title song gained great popularity in Serbia and the diaspora. Concerts and performances in Germany , Austria , Switzerland and other European countries followed. In addition to the title song, the songs \"Idi, nek' te sre\u0107a prati\" ( Go, Let the luck follow you ), \"Umri\" ( Die ) and others were also well listened to, and considering that she also included previous hits on that album, the listeners could recall the songs \"Samo\", \"Ne\u0107u da ostarim\" ( I won't grow old ) and others. The title song from that album, and one of Stoja's greatest hits, song \"Evropa\" ( Europe ), can be heard in episode 19 of Bosnian TV series Viza za budu\u0107nost ; that is when many people in Bosnia and Herzegovina started to listen Stoja, and since then she has been notably popular in this country; Stoja herself uploaded the mentioned insert from the series on her official YouTube channel. She released her next, fifth studio album in 2003 under the name Zakletva ( Oath ). And then she treated the audience with eight new songs, among which \"\u017diveo\" ( Live long ), \"Da zavolim ludo\" ( To Fall Madly in Love ), \"Samo idi\" ( Just go ) and others stood out. After that, there was a new turn in her career. She decided to completely change her appearance, lost more than twenty kilograms, dyed herself blue and released the ballad \" Starija \" ( Older ), which represented something completely different from the songs she had previously sung. The album of the same name was released on the market in 2004, and besides the title track, \"Diamonds\", \"Da se\u010de\u0161 vene\" ( To cut your veins ) and others were also heard. \"Starija\" was declared folk album of the year. Stoja released the EP Osveta with two songs in 2006 with the band Ju\u017eni Vetar . Two years later, in 2006 she released her seventh studio album under the title Metak ( Bullet ). There were eight new songs on it, including a duet with \u0160ako Polumenta called \"Gde god podjem tebi idem\" ( Wherever I go, I go to you ), \"Ne slu\u0161aj vesti\" ( Don\u2019t listen to the news ) and one of her most acclaimed songs in her career \"Ne\u0161to mi govori\" ( Something is telling me ). The audio of that song has 53 million views on her YouTube channel as of 2024. Both the title song and the duet song were well received by the audience. That year, Stoja was declared the best folk singer in BiH, and her song \"Metak\" won the \"Belgrade Winner\" award. Acclaimed Success (2008-2015) In 2008, she released her most acclaimed album Do gole ko\u017ee ( To the bare skin ) by the Grand Production Company. The title song and track \"Ku\u010dka\" stood out from this album, for which Stoja released attractive videos. The ninth studio album appeared on the market already the following year under the title \"Naj, naj\". The most popular songs from that album are \"Are you for sex\", \"Zamalo\", \"Ja\u010da nego pre\", \"Naj, naj\", \"Potopicu ovaj splav\" and her most famous song, a duet with Dejan Mati\u0107 \"Muzika\" ( Music ), which has over 21 million views on Grand Productions YouTube channel. The song \"Revolucija\" ( Revolution ) and its music video were both released in October 2010. The video caused some stir in the media because it featured Stoja bathing in a bathtub full of peppers. Her tenth studio album entitled Nije da nije ( It's Not That It's Not ) was released on 6 May 2013 by the Bosnia-based label BN Music , marking the first time in 15 years that Stoja has released an album with a production company other than Grand Production. Following the release of Nije da nije , Stoja began releasing non-album singles including \" Bela ciganka \", \" Ola ola \", \"Takvog de\u010dka ho\u0107u ja\", \"Lila lila\", and \"Ti brate ima\u0161 sve\". Her song \" Bela ciganka \" ( White Gypsy ) which was published on her YouTube channel, became an international success with over 100 million views as of 2024, making in one of the most viewed videos on Balkan . Album Bela ciganka was released in 2015; it includes old hits, as well as new such as \"Kao ovde nigde nije\" (first song, displayed on cover). Two singles were released the next year: \"Ponovo\" and \"Ko pre\u017eivi neka pri\u010da\". BN Music published her single \"Lila, Lila\" in February 2015. Stoja hired a proven good team of collaborators for this song as well, so success was not lacking. The track has so far been viewed more than 10 million times on YouTube. In October of the same year, she presented the single \"Kao ovde nigde nije\", which became one of the most requested songs at performances abroad. Tours all over Europe followed, and she organized a big concert for her listeners in Sofia, Bulgaria , which was attended by more than 18,000 people. Now (2015-present) In the following period, singles with music videos are released by Stoja: \"Bomba\" (2017). In April 2017, with young singers Relja Popovi\u0107 and Coby , they released the song \"Samo jako\" (\"Just go hard\") which samples her song from 2000 \"Samo\" from her album Samo in April. In one show, she admitted that this type of music was not close to her, but she decided to support her dear colleagues. The collaboration was immediate success, and the song gained 77 million views on YouTube. In May 2018, Coby and Stoja released the duet \"Cista hemija\", whose lyrics were written by Petar Lugonja and Vuka\u0161in Jasni\u0107, and music and arrangement by Veljkovi\u0107. The song divided Stoja's fans into those who like her and those who think she should return to the music she did a few years ago. \"Ne treba mi \u017eivot\" (2017), \"\u010cista hemija\" (music video in which she is dressed like Gaddafi ; ft Coby, 2018), \"Ko bi rekao\" (ft Kija Kockar , 2018), \"Idi mami pa se \u017eali\" (2019), \"\u017dena sa Balkana\" (ft Mimi Mercedez , 2019), \"Svet se vrti oko nas\" (ft Mimi Mercedez , 2019), \"Taki taki\" (2019), \"Neka pati\" (ft Milan, 2019) and \"Aj, chiki, chiki\" (ft Ludi Srbi, 2019).

The last release in 2019 was Geto Gerila remix of Stoja's hit \"\u0106iki, \u0107iki\" (same-named album, 1999) entitled \"Aj, chiki, chiki\" and published on 20 December. Stoja had announced release of song \"Lice\" which was not published then because of 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic ; the song was published in June 2020. In June 2021 she released song \"Hera\" with Balkan Star label. Stoja released \"Da li ona zna\" (\"Does she knows\") on her YouTube channel in June 2023. Stoja has been working with her long-time friend and lyricist Stevan Simeunovi\u0107 who is author of almost all her songs since her career has started. Personal life Relationships Novakovi\u0107 was first married at age 16, became a mother at 17 and was widowed at 19 when her first husband lost his life in a 1991 car crash, ending their three-year marriage. When talking about her husband, she said; \"I knew my first husband from the village. He was from a rich farming family and much older than me. One day he came to my father to propose me. Dad told him that it will be as I decide. I was 16 years old and I got married literally right out of school. After a few months, I became pregnant and it was a real shock for my parents. It wasn't a problem for me. I went to school pregnant and graduated. My first husband was attentive to me and I had a carefree life. He looked after our son and me and did not allow anything to disturb us. Whenever I wanted to do something, he would tell me that there was no need because he had enough money for everything.\" The period after his death was financially difficult for her. She was quoted as saying \"I was very poor. I did not have anything to eat.\" She became a grandmother at age 33 when her son Milan's first child was born. Since 2007, she has lived in Belgrade , more specifically the Be\u017eanijska kosa neighborhood in New Belgrade . Novakovi\u0107 married architect Igor Jovanovi\u0107 on 1 November 2009, after being in a relationship for five years. Their relationship has been on-again-off-again, with the couple constantly breaking up and getting back together. In a March 2014 interview, Novakovi\u0107 revealed that she once attempted suicide by driving her car into a wall to keep their marriage from dissipating. Family On 4 October 2011, Stoja found her mother Katica, who had heart problems and diabetes , dead in bed after being suspicious when Katica did not emerge from her bedroom that morning. Stoja survived a car accident on 28 May 2012 when her car was totaled after being hit by a truck. She escaped with a minor injury to the forehead. Stoja has said that her favorite singer is \u0160emsa Suljakovi\u0107 and she has frequently covered Suljakovi\u0107's songs at concerts and television appearances, and was even interviewed with her in June 2012. Cosmetic surgeries Stoja is known for numerous cosmetic procedures and exceptional figure, which has accompanied her since the beginning of her career. Stoja is one of the first people from Serbia 's showbusiness world to admit that she went to Turkey for cosmetic surgery and that it cost a lot (the figure of over 100,000\u20ac is also mentioned). The surgeries were mostly corrective and aimed at getting a more beautiful figure, because Stoja has been struggling with \"extra pounds\" since the beginning of her career. - I know that! When I change, I change everything! This summer I promised to lose weight and do something new. I tried and it worked, I'm really happy. I spent 10 days and two months recovering in Turkey. It still hurts, I was immobile for 3-4 days - she said and added: - I was in an artificial coma for nine and a half hours. I would not like to talk about the figure, but it is somewhere around 100,000\u20ac. When you say Turkey, everyone knows that it is not very cheap and easy, but I am very satisfied - concluded Stoja for Pink.rs . After these corrections, Stoja specially secured one part of her body: - I secured my butt like J.Lo . It's not exactly a million like her, because we live in Serbia, but in accordance with our financial possibilities - the folk singer pointed out.

{"id": "doc_fixed_074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaye_Radisich", "text": "Jaye Amber Radisich (29 March 1976\u00a0\u2013 17 March 2012) was an Australian politician. She was a Labor Party member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly from 2001 to 2008, representing the electorate of Swan Hills . Radisich was the youngest woman ever to be elected to the Western Australian parliament. Early life Radisich was born and raised in Perth, Western Australia . At 12 years of age, she was awarded a Citizenship Award from the City of Stirling Council for her all round academic performance and community involvement. Radisich attended Mount Lawley Senior High School . In Year 12, Radisich was appointed as School Prefect, Caltex All-rounder, and Belle of the Ball. Radisich was also a member of the Senior Debating Team and a participant on numerous committees including the Student Council, Common Room and Amnesty International. Radisich went on to study arts, law and commerce at the University of Western Australia . Radisich became involved in student politics while at university, and served as a member of the National Union of Students executive, and the Vice-President (Asia-Pacific) of the International Union of Socialist Youth . While at university, she worked two jobs, as a check-out operator at a budget cosmetics chain and a research officer. She was juggling these commitments with the final year of her degree when she won pre-selection to contest the theoretically safe Liberal seat of Swan Hills as the Labor candidate for the 2001 state election. Political career Swan Hills was held by a sitting Liberal minister in the Court government, June van de Klashorst , and in the leadup to the poll, there was little sign that she was in any danger of losing the seat. In a major upset, the Labor vote increased enough that Radisich was able to narrowly defeat van de Klashorst with the assistance of Liberals for Forests and One Nation preferences. She became the second-youngest person, and the youngest woman, to be elected to the Western Australian parliament. She faced re-election at the February 2005 election, and was widely expected to lose her seat, due to the surprise result that had elected her in 2001 and a redistribution that had further slashed her tenuous margin. Radisich herself claimed that \"many people\" had anticipated her defeat. However, as the election drew closer, some analysts began to predict that she could hold on. These assertions were proved correct when, on election day, Radisich received a swing of more than 3%, and held onto her seat. Radisich served as Chair of the Economics and Industry Standing Committee from 2005 to 2007. In 2006 Radisich tabled a report on the production and marketing of foodstuffs. The report examined the market dominance of the major retail chains and also analysed issues relating to the health and safety of our food, labelling requirements and the production and marketing of foodstuffs. The committee recommended a new way forward in support of consumer information about the food we eat that is grown, farmed or fished in WA by way of a voluntary state of origin certification and marketing program. Radisich's parliamentary service culminated in her appointment as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Energy, Resources, Industry and Enterprise in April 2007. Radisich also served on the Joint Standing Committee on the Anti-Corruption Commission and the Public Accounts Committee during her term. In the leadup to the 2008 state election , Radisich sought preselection for the new seat of West Swan , a safer seat for Labor than the more marginal Swan Hills. However, after reports stating that she would likely lose in any preselection contest for West Swan to Rita Saffioti , the chief of staff to Premier Alan Carpenter , she announced that she would retire from politics at the next election. Radisich expressed a desire to pursue other ambitions, including post-graduate study and public policy interests at a Federal level. Graham Giffard , a then-sitting MLC, won Labor Party pre-selection for Swan Hills and lost the seat to the Liberal candidate Frank Alban in the 2008 election . Post-political career Council of Small Business Australia In February 2009, Radisich was selected from 160 applicants for the position of chief executive officer at the Council of Small Business Australia (COSBOA). During her tenure, Radisich successfully lobbied to prevent the Australian Federal Communications Minister from extending the \"Do Not Call\" Register to business numbers. She also oversaw a twelvefold increase in revenue. Radisich demonstrated a solid track record of working with the private sector as CEO of COSBOA. She formed a partnership between COSBOA, Telstra and the Federal Government to deliver information to small businesses about new, modernised awards following the introduction of the Fair Work Act in July 2009. Radisich resigned from the position in May 2010. Illness and death Initial diagnosis In 2002, during the early months of her first parliamentary term, Radisich was diagnosed with adult wilms tumour , a rare form of cancer. She had the kidney containing the tumour removed and continued to work as a member of parliament while undergoing subsequent chemotherapy . Secondary diagnosis In November 2010 Radisich was again diagnosed with a wilms tumour in her remaining kidney. Radisich underwent surgery to remove the tumour while preserving her kidney, followed by a course of chemotherapy . Radisich was informed that no further treatment for the cancer was required in June 2011. A routine scan conducted in October 2011 revealed that the cancer had aggressively returned and she was informed that surgery and cancer treatments available in Australia would not remedy her condition, only prolong her death. Radisich underwent Sonodynamic, Photodynamic, P53 Gene, Ozone and Dendritic Cell therapies in Xi'an , China from October til December 2011. Due to a lack of accessible and accurate information available about the alternative treatments, she maintained a blog to share her experience with other cancer sufferers also considering the treatments. The alternative treatments in China ultimately proved unsuccessful. The cancer continued to spread and Radisich succumbed to her condition at approximately 11\u00a0am, 17 March 2012, aged 35.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade\u00a0II listed building . History The site has been occupied since before 1327. The oldest surviving part of the present house dates from 1595, when it was built for Thomas Dod. In 1873 the house was extended, incorporating fabric from the older house, by the Chester architect John Douglas . This was commissioned by Sir\u00a0Philip de\u00a0Grey Egerton of Oulton Park as a dower house . Late-19th century occupants of the Hall included the calico printer William Graham Crum JP (son of the Scottish chemist Walter Crum and father of John Macleod Campbell Crum ). It was purchased by Malcolm Walker, owner of the Iceland Food Store Chain, in 1985 for \u00a3750,000, and re-modelled and extended for him by The Carnell Green Partnership in 1987\u201388. Architecture The house is timber-framed with oak frames and plaster panels. The roofs are of stone slates and have ornate bargeboards and finials . The chimneys consist of detached diagonal flues . The house is in two storeys. The original part of the house has four bays and two gables and a gabled porch. To the left of this part of the house is a recessed wing with one gable and to its right is a projecting wing with one gable. To the sides of each of these are further recessed wings, that to the left having a further gable. The windows are of oak; those in the upper storey have mullions and those in the lower storey have mullions and transoms . The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner described it as being \"an ornate gabled black and white house\". The lodge to the hall is also listed Grade\u00a0II. It is dated 1873, is a timber-framed building on a brick plinth and was designed by John Douglas. It has one storey and is in Jacobethan style. Gardens The grounds of the hall contain a formal garden, garden terraces, lawns, a lake, follies and a yew avenue. The grounds are not open to the public. In the garden is a structure cut into a cliff and partly lined with blocks of sandstone . It dates from the early 19th\u00a0century or before. Its base measures around 6m square and it is 4m high. On the floor are stone flags and the ceiling slopes to a central ridge. To its right is a shallow partly natural cave. The structure is a Grade\u00a0II listed building. It has been described variously as a \"stone parlour\", a grotto, or King James' Parlour.

After a career-best ten goals in 28 matches in 1974\u201375 , he caught the attention of S.L. Benfica , where he would however appear rarely over the course of two Primeira Liga seasons. After reviving his career with his first club, Romeu moved in 1979 to FC Porto , where he would be much more used than at Benfica, in a four-season spell. The northern side however, only won one Portuguese Supercup , in 1981. Aged 29, Romeu joined the last of the Big Three , Sporting Clube de Portugal . Except for his debut campaign , he would not be more than a fringe player as the team came totally empty on silverware, and finally retired in 1988 after one-year spells with modest S.C. Salgueiros and Amora FC (the latter in division two ). In the 90s/2000s, Romeu had several spells as a manager, also working with Benfica as a scout and match observer (1999\u20132001).

Concepts In an interview with New Noise Magazine vocalist Michael Lessard stated that \"Level 3 is a slight continuation of Level 2, but it\u2019s not all about video games. It evolves from the concept of the character from the previous album transcending from the second dimension into the third, it\u2019s kind of a twisty, turny thing in that, but it\u2019s not about video games this time. It\u2019s a different animal.\" Commenting on the writing process Lessard stated \"The processes were similar but there were different musicians in the mix, so that made for a different creative process just dealing with different people. Generally, it was kind of the same thing but there was a little more distance between us so we had to use the interwebs a little more than usual.

{"id": "doc_fixed_084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMBC_Nikko_Securities", "text": "SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. (SMBC\u65e5\u8208\u8a3c\u5238\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e) is a securities firm in Japan which engages in the operation of large-scale comprehensive securities broking and trading services. The company was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan . It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group . It is the third largest securities brokerage firm in Japan. History The origins of SMBC Nikko Securities can be traced back to a company named Kawashimaya Shoten (\u5ddd\u5cf6\u5c4b\u5546\u5e97) which was formed in July 1918 by Genichi Toyama. It was formed to buy and sell stocks and bonds. In 1920, the firm was created out of the securities department of the Industrial Bank of Japan and incorporated as a stock company. In 1939, Kawashimaya Shoten spun off its securities division forming Kawashimaya Securities. In 1943, Kawashimaya Securities absorbed Kawashimaya Shoten. In 1944, Kawashimaya Securities and Nikko Securities merged, and the resulting company used the Nikko Securities trade name. In 2001, the firm changed its name from Nikko Securities to Nikko Cordial Securities. In 2007, the firm became a subsidiary of Citigroup after Citigroup purchased Nikko Cordial Corporation forming Nikko Citi Holdings Inc . In September 2009, Citigroup sold the firm to the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation . In 2011, the firm changed its name from Nikko Cordial Securities to SMBC Nikko Securities. In 2016, the firm became a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group. In 2018, the firm merged with SMBC Friend Securities, while continuing to use the SMBC Nikko Securities trade name. Controversies 2012 insider trading fine In April 2012, the Financial Services Agency fined the firm for leaking information about a stock offering which was considered insider trading . Directors of the firm passed on word of the offering to at least 21 sales branches without carrying out the proper internal procedures to control the information flow. At eight of those branches a total of 23 sales staff tipped off 34 clients to purchase the shares once the deal was launched. The deal was said to be a roughly 1\u00a0trillion yen ($12.4\u00a0billion) offering by Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Nikko's parent, in early 2010. Investigation into block trade market manipulation In November 2021, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) launched an investigation into the firm over suspicious stock transactions. The firm was suspected of using its proprietary trading desk to illegitimately maintain the price of stocks in block trades . The firm launched a complaint with financial regulators after a senior trader died following intensive questioning. On 4 March 2022, four employees of the firm were arrested on allegations of market manipulation in connection with the same block trades. The employees were Trevor Hill (Head of equity), Alexandre Avakiants (Deputy head of equity), Makoto Yamada (General manager of equity trading ) and Shinichiro Okazaki (General manager of structured products ). The firm's President & CEO, Yuichiro Kondo issued a public apology afterwards. On 24 March 2022, prosecutors arrested a vice president of the firm and brought criminal charges against the company and five bankers. On 13 April, prosecutors charged the vice president and filed new criminal charges against the firm. On 14 February 2023, a court ordered SMBC Nikko Securities to pay a fine of 700 million yen ($5.3\u00a0million) and an additional penalty of around 4.47\u00a0billion yen for manipulating stock prices.

{"id": "doc_fixed_086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacker_rock", "text": "Slacker rock (originally known as lo-fi or lo-fi indie ) is a subgenre of indie rock that emerged in the United States during the late 1980s to early 1990s. Characterized by a rejection of technical proficiency and production quality, in favor of stripped down lo-fi aesthetics and an apathetic singing style. The style was originally associated with Generation X slacker culture . However, experienced a resurgence during the 2000s and 2010s amongst Millennials and Gen Z . Notable acts include Pavement , Built to Spill , Sebadoh , the Microphones , Silver Jews and Guided By Voices . Etymology and characteristics Slacker rock was initially intertwined with \" slacker \" culture which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s amongst Generation X , with its association with a specific cultural attitude being primarily popularized by director Richard Linklater 's 1990 cult film , Slacker . The term \"slacker\" described a teenager that showcased a nonchalant attitude and general blas\u00e9 approach to life. Slacker rock became musically reflective of slacker culture, employing less emphasis on technical proficiency and production quality, in favor of stripped down lo-fi aesthetics and an apathetic singing style. History 1980s\u20131990s: Origins See also: Indie rock and Lo-fi music Slacker rock emerged out of the American indie and college rock scene, originally drawing influence from alternative rock bands like Sonic Youth , Pixies , and Dinosaur Jr. as well as 1980s cassette era lo-fi artists like Beat Happening and Daniel Johnston , earlier influences included New Zealand 's Dunedin sound which featured bands such as the Clean and Chris Knox 's Tall Dwarfs . During the 1980s, slacker rock first came to prominence through the indie rock scene, though initially referred to as \"lo-fi\", the music was associated with bands like Guided by Voices who formed in 1983 and treated low-fidelity analog recording as an intentional musical aesthetic, which had previously been viewed as a negative technological limitation. By the late 1980s to early 1990s, the American lo-fi movement began to gain prominence in the alternative and DIY underground music scene, with the sound evolving into a distinct indie rock genre popularized by bands like the Lemonheads , Camper Van Beethoven and Pavement . Later bands like Built to Spill , Sebadoh , and Sparklehorse , further proliferated the movement. Slacker rock saw its commercial height in the 1990s with popular artists like Beck . 2000s\u20132020s: Revival In the 2000s, the indie music scene experienced a resurgence in analog technology and retro aesthetics brought upon by the popularity of genres like chillwave and hypnagogic pop , which brought about a re-interest in cassette culture and early lo-fi and slacker rock bands. In the 2010s, slacker rock experienced a revival spearheaded by artists like Mac DeMarco , Alex G and Car Seat Headrest , as well as artists like Kurt Vile , Vivian Girls , Courtney Barnett , and Ovlov . Subsequently, slacker rock's resurgence would later influence the bedroom pop movement.

Representatives of the Thirteen Colonies met in New York City in 1765 as the Stamp Act Congress to discuss a unified response to the abuses exemplified by the 1765 Stamp Act and other legislation from the British Parliament deemed contrary to the British constitution . A result was the Declaration of Rights and Grievances passed on October 19, 1765. This deliberative body and the Declaration it produced was at the other end of the resistance spectrum from the Sons of Liberty , who were at the same time using civil disobedience and public displays to agitate for British reform in the colonies. American colonists opposed the acts in large part because they were passed without consultation with colonial legislatures, violating their rights as Englishmen . The Declaration of Rights raised fourteen points of colonial protest but was not directed solely to the Stamp Act. Among the assertions it made that were not specific protests of the Stamp Act are the following: Colonists owe to the crown \"the same allegiance\" owed by \"subjects born within the realm \". Colonists owe to Parliament \"all due subordination\". Colonists possessed all the rights of Englishmen . Trial by jury is a right. The use of Admiralty Courts was abusive. Without voting rights , Parliament could not represent the colonists. There could be no taxation without representation . Only the colonial assemblies had a right to tax the colonies.

{"id": "doc_fixed_088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Verdery", "text": "Katherine Verdery (born 1948) is an American anthropologist , author, and emeritus professor, following her tenure as the Julien J. Studley Faculty Scholar and Distinguished Professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York . Career She used to be the Eric R. Wolf Professor of Anthropology and Director of the Center for Russian and East European Studies at the University of Michigan (1997\u20132005), following twenty years as an assistant/associate professor of anthropology at the Johns Hopkins University (1977\u20131997). Verdery played a number of important roles in academic research institutions. The first anthropologist to be elected to the presidency of the National Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (2004\u20132006), she also held important advisory positions (such as on the Board of Overseers, Harvard University , and the Board of Electors, William Wyse Professorship and Chair of Social Anthropology , Cambridge University ). From 1987 to 1990 she was the American Anthropological Association 's representative to the American Council of Learned Societies / Soviet Academy of Sciences Commission on Ethnography, and from 1989 to 1990 she was the vice president of the Romanian Studies Society . She served on the National Council for Soviet and East European Research as trustee (1989\u20131996), an executive board member (1991\u20131993), and chair of the board (1995\u20131996). From 2002 to 2005, she was a member of the executive board of the Social Science Research Council , as a representative for anthropology. She also served on the boards of the American Anthropological Association and the American Ethnological Society. Academics Among the first anthropologists to conduct research behind the Iron Curtain , Verdery spent an extended period working in Romania in the 1970s\u20131980s. From this research she published eight books and numerous articles, as well as several edited collections, all informed by her theoretical model of socialism. Her work placed her in the forefront of scholars of the socialist system, both in anthropology and more broadly. Her primary themes were ethno-national identity; the political economy of Romania before, during, and after socialism; property relations; and ethnography in the archives of the communist-era Romanian Secret Police , a topic she pioneered. Having worked in Romania for an extended period in the 1970s\u20131980s, she was extensively surveilled by the Securitate under the Ceau\u0219escu regime, which incorrectly suspected her of spying. After Ceau\u0219escu's fall , she was able to view her surveillance files through the National Council for the Study of the Securitate Archives ( CNSAS ). Her book My Life as a Spy: Investigations in a Secret Police File describes the files' contents and her reactions to seeing them.

{"id": "doc_fixed_090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start-up_Nation", "text": "Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle is a 2009 book by Dan Senor and Saul Singer about the economy of Israel . It examines how Israel was able to reach such economic growth that \"at the start of 2009, some 63 Israeli companies were listed on the NASDAQ , more than those of any other foreign country.\" In 2010, Start-up Nation was ranked fifth on the business bestseller list of The New York Times . It also reached The Wall Street Journal bestseller list. Despite claims in the media that Dan Senor coined the phrase \"start-up nation\" in 2009, the phrase was featured in American technology media at least since November 2000 in an article by Stacy Perman titled \"Startup Nation\" describing Israel. Book overview The Council on Foreign Relations stated in its publisher's blurb for the book that Start-up Nation addresses the question: \"How is it that Israel\u2014a country of 7.1 million people, only sixty years old, surrounded by enemies, in a constant state of war since its founding, with no natural resources\u2014produces more start-up companies on a per capita basis than large, peaceful, and stable nations and regions like Japan, China, India, Korea, Canada, and all of Europe?\" The Economist noted that Israel had more high-tech start-ups and a larger venture capital industry per capita than any other country in the world. The Economist described Start-up Nation as the most notable of a \"growing pile\" of books on the success of Israel's technology sector. In their attempt to explain Israel's success in this area, Senor and Singer discard \"the argument from ethnic or religious exceptionalism, dismissing 'unitary Jewishness' or even individual talent as major reasons for Israel's high-tech success\" and analyze two major factors that, in the authors' opinion, contribute most to Israel's economic growth. Those factors are mandatory military service and immigration . The authors argue that a major factor for Israel's economic growth can be found in the culture of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), in which service is mandatory for most young Israelis. The authors suggest that service in the IDF equips future entrepreneurs with a broad range of skills and valuable connections. They assert that the IDF provides experience in taking on responsibility within a relatively flat organizational structure. IDF soldiers \"have minimal guidance from the top, and are expected to improvise, even if this means breaking some rules. If you're a junior officer, you call your higher-ups by their first names, and if you see them doing something wrong, you say so.\" Neither ranks nor ages matter much \"when taxi drivers can command millionaires and 23-year-olds can train their uncles,\" and \"Israeli forces regularly vote to oust their unit leaders.\" The book also dwells at length on immigration and its role in Israel's economic growth: \"Immigrants are not averse to starting from scratch. They are by definition risk-takers. A nation of immigrants is a nation of entrepreneurs. From survivors of the Holocaust to Soviet refuseniks through the Ethiopian Jews, the State of Israel never ceased to be a land of immigration: 9 out of 10 Jewish Israelis today are immigrants or descendants of immigrants, the first or second generation. This specific demographic, causing fragmentation of the community that still continues in the country, is nevertheless a great incentive to try their luck, to take risks because immigrants have nothing to lose.\" Additional factors cited by the authors include a sense of dissatisfaction with the status quo, a culture that encourages experimentation with technology, and government policies that support start-ups. Using stories and anecdotes, the book provides examples of Israel's technological and medical achievements, among them \"the Israeli innovations that made possible Google Suggest, the list of suggestions that appear instantly in menu form as you type a search request, the capsule endoscopy, a miniature camera embedded in a pill so that 18 photos per second can be wirelessly and painlessly transmitted from gastrointestinal tracts.\" The book highlights Israel\u2019s numerous achievements in technological innovation, but also examines why Israel has yet to produce its own major corporations. The authors attribute this partly to the tendency of Israeli startups to be acquired by large foreign companies and partly to mismanagement. To write the book, Senor and Singer interviewed over 100 individuals, including Israeli venture investors, historians, U.S. military officials, and Israeli heads of state. they conclude that \"while Israel has much to learn from the world, the world has much to learn from Israel.\" Authors Dan Senor is a former foreign policy official in the United States government. He served as chief spokesman for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq and now advises venture capital firms. Saul Singer is a columnist and former editorial page editor for The Jerusalem Post . Critical reception Praise Jon Rosen of USA Today believed that the book is written from an Israeli perspective and could frustrate those opposed to the nation's foreign policy . However, he still considered it an accomplishment, \"not simply for exposing the roots of Israel's success, but by showing what the Israeli case might teach the rest of the world.\" In The Wall Street Journal , James K. Glassman said that \"the greatest strength of Start-up Nation is not analysis but anecdote. The authors tell vivid stories of entrepreneurial success, such as that of Shai Agassi, the son of an Iraqi immigrant to Israel, with his electric-automobile technology, now in the process of creating 'Car 2.0.'\" Publishers Weekly stated that \"the authors ground their analysis in case studies and interviews with some of Israel's most brilliant innovators to make this a rich and insightful read not just for business leaders and policy makers but for anyone curious about contemporary Israeli culture.\" In The Economic Times , R Gopalakrishnan wrote that the use of Hebrew expressions made the book \"alive and eminently-readable.\" Gopalakrishnan concluded that the ideas demonstrated in the book \"are highly relevant for innovation capability in general, but for India, especially at this juncture.\" David Horovitz of The Jerusalem Post said that conclusions of Start-up Nation are validated by real-world events, such as the treatment given to Gabby Giffords after the 2011 Tucson shooting , where an emergency medical team used a elasticized bandage developed in Israel to control her head wounds. A review in The Washington Post says that \"the book weaves together colorful stories of Israeli technological triumphs\" such as the story of Shvat Shaked , who \"founded a cybersecurity firm with his old buddy from Army intelligence and had the chutzpah to bet a top executive at PayPal, the online commerce company owned by eBay, that his few dozen engineers could beat PayPal's thousands in developing secure online software.\" The review also states that the authors could have done a better job drawing \"straight lines between their theories about Israel's success and these case studies\". Maureen Farrell of Forbes was disappointed that the authors mostly ignored the effects of United States foreign aid to Israel . This percentage was as high as ~13% during some years of the first decades after 1950, according to The Times of Israel . She says the book \"is worth reading to understand not just Israel's history but the history of capitalism and innovation.\" Criticism Ruth Schuster, reviewing the book for Haaretz , feels that it is \"tarnished by a jarring, tub-thumping patriotism.\" A review in The Christian Science Monitor notes that \"critics say that the story behind how a country of 7 million has more Nasdaq-listed companies than Europe is more complex than Singer and Senor paint it to be.\" Yusuf Mansur , writing in The Jordan Times , contends that two factors cited by Senor and Singer as key to Israel\u2019s success\u2014the IDF and Soviet-Jewish immigration\u2014have only been sustainable due to foreign aid from the United States and private sources. Mansur also criticizes the authors for attributing the gap in entrepreneurship between Israel\u2019s Palestinian and Jewish communities to Arabs and Palestinians' exemption from military service, instead of what he views as \"Israel\u2019s discriminatory policies against its Arab citizens,\" particularly in areas of education and employment. Gal Beckerman, writing in The Forward magazine, observes that the book \"presents Israel in an extremely positive light as a bastion of entrepreneurial spirit and technological achievement. It skirts a discussion of the conflict with the Palestinians , or even the wealth inequality within Israel, thereby dovetailing nicely with recent public relations efforts by Israel to shift attention away from its problems and toward its achievements.\" Impact Journalists and policymakers in several countries have recommended Start-up Nation as a useful guide for promoting entrepreneurship. A review of the book in The Irish Times calls on Ireland to follow Israel's model. Andrius Kubilius , the prime minister of Lithuania , has cited Start-up Nation as his favorite book. Yrj\u00f6 Ojasaar, managing partner of Solon Partners, an executive consulting and angel investor company in Estonia , says \"there is much to be learned from the Israeli experience of venture capital incubation through building incentives for privatization.\" CNN 's Fareed Zakaria called Start-up Nation \"a book every single Arab businessman, Arab bureaucrat, and Arab politician should read.\" The book is cited as a handbook of \"classic economics.\" It teaches small businesses \"how effective a cohesive team can be, especially when that team emphasizes chutzpah first.\" Former Palestinian prime minister Salam Fayyad reportedly kept a copy of Start-up Nation on his desk as a source of inspiration for the West Bank 's own burgeoning technology industry.

{"id": "doc_fixed_092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Meckler", "text": "Nancy Meckler is an American-born director, known for her approach to theatre, specifically her work in the United Kingdom with Shared Experience , where she was a joint artistic director alongside Polly Teale . Educated in the US and England, she has directed for a number of prominent theatres, including the Globe Theatre, the Royal National Theatre, and the Royal Shakespeare Company. She has also directed feature films such as Sister My Sister , and Alive and Kicking/Indian Summer . Early life and education Meckler is native to Long Island, New York. It was there that she began to take interest in the arts, though directing was not her original passion; at first she wanted to be an actor. She was initially attracted to theatre because of its ability to expose audiences to new and different worldviews. Meckler attended several academic institutions in the US, beginning with Antioch College for her undergraduate degree, then moving on to study acting at HB Studios. Finally, she obtained a master's degree in Performance Theory and Criticism from NYU . Meckler also spent a year in London training at the London Academy for the Dramatic Arts. After this, her focus slowly moved to directing; she realized she did not want to be in the spotlight, but still had a strong interest in theatre. Her future directorial pursuits were greatly steered by the New York avant-garde scene of the 1960s; her influences at the time included Jerzy Grotowski , a prominent experimental and avant-garde figure of the era. She moved to London in 1968, a time when many American artists were relocating to the UK, permanently changing the theatre scene in the places they landed. Career Once in the UK, Meckler founded the Freehold Theatre Company (1968\u201372), which, while it did not last long, had a successful and recognized production of the play Antigone . In 1970, Antigone was sent by the British Council to represent the UK at BITEF and the Venice Biennale . The Freehold Theatre Company won the John Whiting Award for New Writing in 1970. Freehold Theatre Company disbanded after Meckler started her family, but she returned to theatre shortly after, becoming the associate director at Hampstead Theatre . During this time, Meckler struggled with the constraints of directing traditional scripted plays and the structure of British theatre, as her work in the past had been more creative and experimental. In 1984, having outgrown the Hampstead scene, Meckler and her husband, David Aukin , who she had been working with at Hampstead, relocated to Leicester Theatre in London. There, Meckler went on to direct the plays of authors such as Shakespeare and other traditional playwrights, but alongside that, she returned to her more experimental pursuits through freelance directing. Meckler was the first woman to direct at the Royal National Theatre , with Edward Albee 's Who's Afraid of\u00a0Virginia Woolf? in 1981. She was the artistic director of Shared Experience Theatre , a fringe theatre company in London, from 1988 to 2011. The company is known for its non-traditional approaches to theatre, namely their tendency to stage well known plays in a way that has not been done before. Meckler has directed 5 plays at the Royal Shakespeare Company as well as King Lear at Shakespeare's Globe .

Both films contain LGBTQ+ subject matter, Robin Griffiths has categorized Sister My Sister as a notable queer British film. Reviewers described Meckler's direction as theatrical; her experience as a stage director clearly present in her on screen work. Various reviewers interpreted this style of directing in different ways, with some saying it adds to the films, and others saying it detracts from them. Sister My Sister , Meckler's most popular film, falls into a common trope of killer or murderous queer people, with the main characters, two sisters working as maids, plotting to kill their employer. However, Meckler's work stands out from others in this trope because it was directed by a woman; this is uncommon for the genre. The film portrays a controversial relationship, an incestuous lesbian romance between two sisters. Ballet Meckler was the director of A Streetcar Named Desire for the Scottish Ballet .

Incumbent Democratic senator Jon Tester successfully ran for reelection to a second term, gaining 48.6% of the vote against Republican U.S. Representative Denny Rehberg who received 44.9% of the vote and Libertarian candidate Dan Cox received 6.56% of the vote.

General election Candidates Dan Cox (Libertarian), retired businessman Denny Rehberg (Republican), U.S. Representative, former lieutenant governor and former state representative Jon Tester (Democratic), incumbent U.S. Senator and former state senator Debates Three debates were scheduled, including one with the Libertarian candidate whose ultimate influence on the race remains uncertain. The first, between Rehberg and Tester, was held on October 8, 2012, at 7 p.m. at Petro Theatre at the MSU Billings University campus. The debate was televised live by Montana PBS andbroadcast on KEMC/Yellowstone Public Radio and streamed on the Gazette's website. It was moderated by Steve Prosinski, editor of The Gazette, with questions from a panel of political reporters. Representatives from the Associated Students of Montana State University Billings, the student government, served as timekeepers. Complete video of debate , October 8, 2012. Complete video of debate , October 20, 2012 Campaign Former president of the Montana Senate and farmer Jon Tester was elected with 49.2% of the vote in 2006, defeating incumbent Conrad Burns . As of June 30, 2011, Jon Tester had saved $2.34 million in campaign funds. Tester has been accused by Republican Denny Rehberg's senate campaign of depending on financial contributions from Wall Street banking executives and movie stars. On February 5, 2011, U.S. Representative Denny Rehberg announced his intention to run for the U.S. Senate. Steve Daines had announced he would seek the Republican nomination on November 13, 2010, but just before Rehberg's announcement he dropped out of the primary and announced he would instead seek the Republican nomination for Montana's at-large congressional district in 2012 . Daines later won Montana\u2019s other U.S. Senate seat in 2014 . As of early July 2010, Denny Rehberg had saved $1.5 million of an original $2 million in campaign funds. Rehberg accused Democrat Jon Tester's senate campaign of depending on financial contributions from Wall Street banking executives and Hollywood while Rehberg's campaign relies primarily on in state donations. Tester's campaign countered that Rehberg has been funded by petroleum special interests and Wall Street. The National Republican Senatorial Committee aired an attack ad against Jon Tester that mistakenly included a digitally manipulated photo of Tester (who has only two fingers on his left hand) with full sets of fingers. Another ad against Tester, from the Karl Rove group Crossroads GPS , falsely asserted that Tester had voted in favor of Environmental Protection Agency regulation of farm dust. In fact, Tester had praised the EPA for not attempting such a regulation. The vote cited in the anti-Tester ad concerned currency exchange rates. In early October 2012, Crossroads GPS announced it would launch a $16 million advertising buy in national races, of which four were this and three other Senate elections.

Top industries Predictions Polling Hypothetical polling Results Tester won re-election to a second term, albeit by a narrow margin. He received about 4% more of the vote than Republican Rehberg, but the difference in Tester and Rehberg's vote totals was less than the vote total of Libertarian Dan Cox, who received 6.6% of the vote.

{"id": "doc_fixed_098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Country", "text": "This article is about the 2009 movie. For the music genre, see Gothic country . Dark Country is a 2009 American mystery thriller film directed by and starring Thomas Jane in his directorial debut. It also stars Lauren German and Ron Perlman . Plot Newlyweds Dick and Gina decide to head across the Nevada desert for their honeymoon, driving at night to beat the heat. Before they head off, a stranger warns Dick to be careful, as couples have been known to get lost, and to stick to the Interstate. Shortly afterward, the couple realize they are heading the wrong way and turn off the highway onto another road. Dick turns off the car headlights to drive by starlight and Gina masturbates herself to orgasm as they head across the desert. Eventually Dick turns the lights back on, immediately swerving to avoid a figure in the middle of the road. Investigating, they find a man severely injured from a car accident. Unable to get a phone signal, they decide to drive him to a hospital themselves, only for the road to come to a sudden end a few miles ahead. During the drive, the couple argue and the injured man awakens with a scream. He asks Gina for a cigarette, advises her to leave her husband and becomes increasingly erratic, finally attempting to strangle Dick and almost causing the car to crash. Gina stops the car and the two men tumble out, continuing to fight until Dick beats the stranger to death with a rock. Dick convinces his wife they need to dispose of the body, and together they bury it in a shallow grave. While she fills the hole, Dick finds a revolver in her handbag. Soon after, they arrive at a rest area where several cars are parked. They tidy themselves up and argue until Dick discovers he lost his watch while they were burying the stranger. Refusing to go back, Gina waits at the rest stop with the gun while Dick returns to find his watch. Arriving at the site where they hid the body, Dick finds the grave empty. Gunshots ring out across the desert and Dick races back to the rest stop to find Gina is missing. Nearby, he stumbles onto a woman's grave and realizes that the other cars are rusted and covered with dust. In a panic, he flees, almost colliding head-on with a deputy sheriff. In the back of the police car, he rides with the deputy to a crime scene, where police are excavating murder victims from a mass grave surrounded by abandoned vehicles. The deputy explains that this was where the rest area had been 30 years before. Dick recognizes the spot as the location where he buried the stranger. As he watches on from the back of the police car, a deputy exhumes Gina's body and finds Dick's watch. Dick kicks his way out of the patrol car and escapes in one of the nearby vehicles, leading the squad of police in a chase across the desert. Driving with the lights off, he loses them, but a short while later he finds a swarm of insects, losing control and rolling the car. Thrown clear of the wreck, he is then almost run down by another car before he passes out. Some time later, Dick wakes to find himself in the back of his own car, listening to himself and Gina argue, and realizes that he was the mysterious stranger that he fought with and murdered earlier in the evening, screaming at this. Cast Thomas Jane as Dick / Bloodyface Lauren German as Gina Ron Perlman as Deputy Thompson Con Schell as Bloodyface Double Chris Browning as Stranger Rene P. Mousseux as Crime Scene Trooper Production The idea for making Dark Country came after Jane had read the short story by the film's writer Tab Murphy . After working for a year on the story, Jane and Murphy brought it to Lionsgate , who purchased the script. Upon learning Jane's intention to shoot the film 3D, Lionsgate backed out of the deal and allowed Jane and Murphy to take the script to Sony Pictures , whose home video division were looking for content for their new line of 3D televisions that were soon to be released. The inspiration Jane had cited for making the film came from his admiration for the horror films of old and film noir , in addition to The Twilight Zone , The Outer Limits and old issues of EC Comics comic books. \"I wanted to make a movie that was for people who enjoy movies that are off the beaten track, you know?\" said Jane. \"I wanted to make a movie for fans of cult films, for fans of \"The Twilight Zone\" , for guys who stayed up late to watch \"The Outer Limits\" when they were probably too young to do that.\" Before filming began, Jane, together with his storyboard artist, story boarded every shot, approaching the film like they were doing a live-action graphic novel. Wanting to have graphic novel elements, Jane brought on-board comic artist Tim Bradstreet to work as the visual consultant and production designer, in addition to Berni Wrightson , who provided the designs for the character Bloodyface, and Ray Zone as the 3D supervisor. Jane chose to do the film in 3D as a way to prove to the filmmaking community that you could create a low-budget film in 3D and have it turn out looking great. The 25-day shoot took place in Albuquerque , New Mexico . The film was shot in both 3-D high definition and 2-D high-def, with the intention of a limited theatrical run in 3D. The 3D for Dark Country was done using two Silicon Imaging (SI) HD heads capturing at 2K resolution, the cameras were built by Hector Ortega and Stephen Pizzo of Element Technica, and supervised by Geoff Boyle, Max Penner, Tim Thomas and Paradise FX in California. The small size of the cameras allowed for more fluid camera movements compared to the cameras previously used to shoot 3D films. For the filming of scenes in 3D, Jane wished for the effect to vary in intensity and be impactful. To help in that, Jane devised a color-coded system for his cameraman to know how he wanted the 3D to be visually in any particular scenes. If I wanted the 3D to be popping-off the screen in a particular shot \u2013 I had a color code for that. If the 3D was to be deep in the background so that you get a real sense of depth, that was another color code. And there were colors for the middle ground. I indicated wherever the 3D would be and map it through the movie \u2013 because I think it can be overstimulating. Thomas Jane has voiced his disappointment over the fact that the studio didn't give the film a theater run, rather releasing it on DVD and not in the 3-D format in which it was intended. Further disappointment comes with the fact that the released cut of the film is far from Jane's preferred version. Release Dark Country was released on DVD on October 6, 2009 in North America by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment and Stage 6 Films . On April 1, 2011, French distributor Metropolitan Filmexport released a Blu-ray 3D edition of the film. A graphic novel adaptation of Dark Country by Swiss artist Thomas Ott was released on May 30, 2012, by Raw Studios through comiXology as a digital download. Critical reception Upon its release Dark Country received mixed reviews, though many reviewers praised Jane's acting and directing style. David Ray Carter of PopMatters said of the film, \" Dark Country throws its whole body into its final sucker punch only to miss by a mile. Jane shows flashes of talent as a director, but he'd be better served with stronger material for his next effort.\" Robert Fure of FilmSchoolRejects.com remarked that \"Dark Country is not a perfect film, but it's a much better film in 3D. The story isn't groundbreaking and again I'll mention The Twilight Zone , but the acting is top notch from Jane, the style of the film is very much grounded in the comic world, and several scenes are over the top awesome. If nothing else, Jane has proven two things: The guy can direct and 3D is awesome.\" JimmyO of JoBlo.com gave the film a positive review stating, \"With Dark Country , his directorial debut, he manages to pump a ton of noir-ish atmosphere into what could have been a by the numbers thriller. Sure you may figure out the big secret pretty quickly, I did, but Dark Country is a visually intense thriller that keeps you watching.\" Conversely David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews gave the film 1 out of 4 stars, stating that \"It's clear right from the opening frames that Jane is going for a hyper-stylized throwback to the film noir thrillers of the 1950s, yet, despite his best efforts, the first-time filmmaker is simply unable to transform the two protagonists into figures worthy of the viewer's interest and sympathy. Jane's reliance on visuals that are almost astonishingly garish.\" And concluding that \" Dark Country ' s pervasive lack of compelling elements cements its place as a misfire of impressively epic proportions (and this is to say nothing of the laughably nonsensical twist ending, which would seem like a stretch within a David Lynch film).\" Jeff Allard of Shock Till You Drop stated of the films problems \"If the same story were told in less time, it might've worked better. This is a half-hour or hour-long anthology episode at best, not a feature. Even with a brief 88 minute running time, Dark Country feels like it's taking excessively long to get to its climax and by the end, what should be an ironic wallop is more of a shoulder shrug.\" While ultimately praising the performances of Jane and German, he concluded that \" Dark Country is a noble effort that takes too many wrong turns and ends up getting lost. For fans that find themselves jonesing for a Twilight Zone -esque tale or some noir atmosphere, however, your mileage may vary.\" See also List of films featuring time loops References ^ a b c d e Michael Fleming (2007-11-13). \"Thomas Jane lights up 'Dark Country' \" .

Brickman in 1898 and currently owned and run by Gordon and Macphail of Elgin . It is situated near Forres in Moray and is fed with spring water from the Chapelton Springs in the Romach Hills beside Forres . History Duncan MacCallum and F.W. Brickmann founded the Benromach Distillery Company in 1898. Duncan MacCallum had previously been working at the Glen Nevis Distillery in Campbeltown and FW Brickmann was a spirit broker in Leith , Edinburgh . Construction work started at the site of Benromach Distillery in 1898 however due to the depression in the Scotch Whisky industry in 1898 the distillery did not start producing whisky until 1900 but closed the same year due to a lack of money. In 1911 Benromach was acquired by the London based Harvey McNair & Co who continued distilling until the onset of the First World War . After the war Benromach was acquired by Benromach Distillery Ltd and was run by this new private company until 1925. In 1938 Benromach was acquired by Associated Scottish Distilleries Ltd which later became a part of Scottish Malt Distillers Ltd . Between 1966 and 1974 the distillery was modernised and continued to run until 1983 when the distillery was officially closed. In 1993 Gordon and MacPhail took over the site and in 1997 they started to restore the distillery to a working order. The design of the distillery was changed slightly to allow it to be operated by one man. Finally in 1998 the distillery was officially reopened by Charles, Prince of Wales and bottling of the new malt started in 2004. At the World Whisky Awards 2014, Benromach 10 Years Old won gold in the \"Best Speyside Single Malt \u2013 12 Years and Under\" category. Scotland's Malt Whisky Trail is a tourism initiative featuring seven working Speyside distilleries including Benromach, a historic distillery ( Dallas Dhu , now a museum) and the Speyside Cooperage . According to a BBC article, visitors can try some of the whiskies and \"see the traditional dunnage warehouse (where the whiskys are stored to mature), the mash tun, the burnished copper stills \u2014 and the cask signed by Prince Charles\". The distillery released its first gin, Red Door, in July 2018. The gin is vapour-infused with eight botanicals, including rowan berries and sea buckthorn The gin was named after the distillery's painted-red doors; a dedicated gin tour was launched at Benromach in August 2019. A limited release winter gin followed later that year.

{"id": "doc_fixed_101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove_Cycle", "text": "Glove Cycle is a 1984 public art installation by Mags Harries , located throughout the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Porter subway and commuter rail station in Porter Square , Cambridge, Massachusetts . The artwork consists of 54 separate bronze pieces and was created with a budget of US$ 30,000. Sculpture Glove Cycle is a sculptural installation of 54 separate bronze sculptures of gloves located throughout Porter station. Individual gloves are located on a turnstile and between the up and down escalators . Small piles of gloves are located at the bottom of the escalators and on the inbound platform, while other gloves are embedded in the floor of both platforms as well as the mezzanine. The gloves are arranged, some in small vignettes, to have different stories and emotions connected to them. Richard Wolkomir of Smithsonian Magazine explains that the first gloves one approaches in the station are \"a big glove giving birth to a little glove\", and that \"Some gloves have two thumbs, or only three fingers. One large glove extends a finger toward a smaller glove, like a caricature of Michelangelo 's Jehovah transmitting life to Adam on the Sistine ceiling .\" Robert O. Boorstin from The Harvard Crimson adds that there are gloves \"in piles, gripping rails, pushing imaginary buttons\u2014as a constant image that the passenger follows from one point of the station to another\". Mags Harries explains that the gloves she crafted \"are anthropomorphic objects with many character possibilities and by their multiplication, take on a life form that might be analogous to the people movement in the subway.\" Robert O. Boorstin claims that this philosophy and explanation are \"somewhat extravagant.\" History Interior of Porter station showing the inbound platform Glove Cycle was created as a part of the MBTA and the Cambridge Arts Council's \" Arts on the Line \" program. This first of its kind program was devised to bring art into the MBTA's planned Northwest Extension of the Red Line subway stations in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and became a model for similar drives for public art across the country. This installation was one of 20 artworks created for this program, out of over 400 proposals submitted by artists for artworks spread out across five different newly created subway stations. The first 20 artworks, including this one, were completed with a total cost of $695,000 USD , or one-half of one percent of the total construction cost of the Red Line Northwest Extension. The cost of this particular sculpture was $30,000. Gloves was not the first theme that Harries considered for her subterranean artwork. Initially her concept revolved around bronze tree roots appearing to come through the walls and into the stations. This idea was turned down by the architects of Porter Station for bringing attention to the fact that the station is deep underground. Harries stated, \"The whole philosophy of subway stations, it turns out, is to make them seem as un-underground as possible,\" something the tree roots idea would be the exact opposite of. The next theme she considered was to create a flock of sheep-shaped turnstiles. This concept fell to the wayside as the snow from a blizzard in Boston began to melt. Harries began to find lost gloves emerging from the snow. She said that, \"They were wet, compacted, squashed\u2014really beautiful!\" These lost items gave her the inspiration for her new sculptural theme, gloves. Three of the gloves were stolen during the sculpture's first decade by vandals who broke them out of walls. References ^ a b Glove Cycle Archived 2012-04-22 at the Wayback Machine .

{"id": "doc_fixed_102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Bernstein", "text": "Leslie Bernstein (October 9, 1939 \u2013 July 28, 2022) was an American cancer epidemiologist and biostatistician. Known particularly for her research on breast cancer , in 1994 Bernstein led a ground-breaking study that found a correlation between moderate exercise and breast cancer risk reduction. Bernstein received many awards for her research, including from the American Association for Cancer Research , and was described as the \"mother of cancer epidemiology\" by City of Hope . Personal life and education Bernstein was born on 9 October 1939 in Long Beach , California . During her youth, she was a nationally ranked swimmer. She graduated from Hughes Junior High in Long Beach and started her studies at the University of California, Los Angeles at the age of 16, earning an undergraduate degree in mathematics in 1959, having initially hoped to become a statistician . When she was 18, she married Saul Bernstein, a physical education student who had similar aspirations to work in medicine . Recognising they could not afford to pay two sets of tuition fees, Bernstein paused her studies to raise their children while her husband trained as a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon . During the Vietnam War , Bernstein's husband was drafted, and the family relocated to Kansas and subsequently Georgia , where he treated wounded soldiers. They later spent a period of time in the United Kingdom, where Bernstein's husband completed his medical fellowship. After a 17-year break, Bernstein resumed her studies at the age of 36 at the University of Southern California . She went on to obtain a master's degree in gerontology in 1978 and a PhD in biometry in 1981, at the age of 41. Bernstein was married until her husband's death in 2010, and they had three children together. Bernstein died on July 28, 2022 at the age of 82. Career and research After receiving her PhD in 1981, Bernstein worked as a researcher and professor at the USC Keck School of Medicine for 25 years, before officially retiring in 2007. She went on to serve as the director of the cancer aetiology at the Beckman Research Institute City of Hope, a cancer research and treatment centre. During her career, Bernstein led several ground-breaking studies. In 1994, she identified that people could reduce their risks of developing breast cancer through moderate exercise, becoming the first researcher to highlight the links between exercise and cancer survival. In 2017, Bernstein participated in a study that found the use of low-dose aspirin could reduce the risk of developing breast cancer in women. In addition to her breast cancer research, Bernstein also contributed to research on other forms of cancer, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma and oesophageal cancer , as well as into the long-term impact of cancer treatments on survivors. Alongside Jonine Bernstein, Bernstein worked on the twenty-year Women's Environmental Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) study, which was the largest study of genetic susceptibility and risk for second primary breast cancer in women already diagnosed with the disease. In 1995, she co-founded the California Teachers Study, a cohort of 133,479 female public school professionals, which studied the impact of health behaviours on disease development through completing regular questionnaires with participants. Bernstein served as the California Teachers Study's Principal Investigator between 2006 and 2016. Bernstein joined the American Association for Cancer Research in 1996, and served as a council member for its Women in Cancer Research group from 2011 until 2013. She also worked closely with the National Breast Cancer Coalition as a proponent for patient advocacy. Her additional support of the NBCC included joining them in testifying before Congress , and taking part in work to dispel myths around abortion being a cause of breast cancer. Recognition In recognition of her cancer prevention research, Bernstein received the AACR\u2013 Prevent Cancer Foundation Award for Excellence in Cancer Prevention Research in 2007, and the AACR\u2013 American Cancer Society Award for Research Excellence in Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention in 2018. She also received recognition the Abraham Lilienfeld Award for Lifetime Contributions to Epidemiology, in addition to awards from the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, the American Society for Preventative Oncology, and the University of Southern California. Bernstein also received recognition for her prominence as a woman in science, as well as for her commitment to mentoring female students, researchers, and faculty members throughout her career. For this, she received City of Hope's Lifetime Achievement Mentoring Award, as well as the Rosalind E. Franklin Award for Women in Science.

Career Our Lady Peace In 1993, Jim Newell, the band's previous drummer, left Our Lady Peace due to commitment issues. The remaining members and their management held open auditions for his replacement. They auditioned over a hundred drummers, ultimately choosing Taggart, who was 17 at the time. The band offered him the drumming position, which Taggart accepted. Our Lady Peace had also recently been given a record deal with Sony Music Canada. In June 2014, Taggart announced that he had left Our Lady Peace and was not coming back. Other projects In addition to drumming for Our Lady Peace, Taggart has worked on various side projects, including providing the drums on Chantal Kreviazuk 's song \"Blue\", Geddy Lee 's song \"Home on the Strange\", and The Beautiful Unknown 's song \"Riot in the House of Ruin\". He also appears in the music video for Chad Kroeger and Josey Scott 's song, \" Hero \", off the Spider-Man soundtrack .

{"id": "doc_fixed_108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_for_Science_Fiction", "text": "The National Association for Science Fiction ( NASF ), New Zealand 's first national science fiction club, was formed in December 1975 by Wellington resident Frank Macskasy. The club expanded over several years and by the early 1980s had branches in Wellington, Auckland , Christchurch and Dunedin , and was for nearly 15 years New Zealand's only nationwide science fiction fan organisation. The logo of NASF - a kiwi , representing New Zealand, superimposed on a stylised rocket History Members in Auckland, Wellington and Dunedin were involved in running national conventions, although none were officially run by NASF, and in many of the fanzines that sprouted up in the late '70s and early '80s, as well as amateur press association Aotearapa . NASF was also a motivating force behind the inauguration of a New Zealand Science Fiction fan awards in the late 1980s (these later reappeared as the Sir Julius Vogel Awards ), and was also the umbrella organisation responsible for the appointing of host sites for national conventions . At its height in the mid-1980s, NASF had a membership of about 150 and a bimonthly club magazine called Warp . By the mid-1990s, the Auckland and Christchurch branches had folded, although there were still club members in those areas. The Dunedin branch and the Wellington branch continued until the late 1990s. Debate continues on why NASF died, as well as whether it was officially wound up, but it was largely inactive by the mid 1990s and went into indefinite recess in late 1997. The rise of science fiction as a popular genre in the cinema and television, coupled with easier access to science fiction books, magazines, movie and television series on video, and later DVD, possibly contributed to NASF's demise. Considerable infighting within the Wellington and Christchurch branches may also have contributed, along with an unwieldy National Committee. The Phoenix Science Fiction Society was founded in Wellington specifically as an alternative to what was seen as a moribund branch of NASF, draining many active fans away from NASF. Other factors included the growth of the internet, which made an organised club less relevant. In contrast to when Macskasy formed NASF in 1976, by the late 1990s, New Zealanders could soak themselves in science fiction without any need to meet other people with the same interest. Many of the national functions of NASF were later taken up by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Association of New Zealand (SFFANZ), which was founded in 2002. Branches Dunedin branch The Dunedin branch of the National Association for Science Fiction (NASF) existed from 1978 until the late 1990s. The branch was the first science fiction club formed in Dunedin and for many years was the southernmost science fiction club in the world. It held fortnightly meetings (later monthly), initially at the children's library in Stuart Street , then at various other venues, the last of which was the W.E.A. building in Crawford Street. The branch organised social events and outings and ran a small lending library. About a dozen people attended the first meetings, but it took till the middle of the year for the official formation of the branch. Membership began to increase as a side effect of Dunedin winning the rights to hold the New Zealand National Science Fiction Convention , Octacon, in 1982. There was also a jump in social gatherings with members meeting every weekend and on some week days. By 1983, the Dunedin branch was the most socially active within NASF and second in size only to the Wellington branch. Branch members were instrumental in staging other national conventions in Dunedin in 1986, 1989 and 1994. Dunedin branch members contributed to the NASF club fanzine Warp which was edited from Dunedin for several years, but the branch itself did not have a regular branch fanzine or newsletter other than the short-lived Larque's Lament , which ran for five issues in the late 1980s, and a one-off fanzine called Can\u2019t Think of a Name So We Called it This! in 1982. Several branch members were also members of Aotearapa , or published their own fanzines, notably Tom Cardy's Worlds Beyond , which ran for 11 issues.

His early NASA assignments have included work on rocket upper stages such as PAM , IUS , and Centaur , as well as Shuttle software verification at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL). In addition, he was the Astronaut Office training coordinator, worked on various Department of Defense payloads, served as a spacecraft communicator ( CAPCOM ) at Mission Control for STS-41-D , STS-41-G , STS-51-A , STS-51-C and STS-51-D , worked Space Station issues for the Astronaut Office, and served as head of the Mission Development Branch within the Astronaut Office. In May 1985 he was named to the crew of STS-61-F , which was to deploy the Ulysses spacecraft on an interplanetary trajectory using a Centaur upper stage. This mission was to have flown in May 1986, but the Shuttle Centaur project was terminated in July 1986, and Hilmers then worked in the areas of ascent abort development, payload safety, and Shuttle on-board software. During 1987 he was involved in training for STS-26 and in flight software development. He later became head of the Mission Development branch in the astronaut office. A veteran of four space flights, he has logged over 493 hours in space. He served as a mission specialist on STS-51-J (October 3\u20137, 1985), STS-26 (September 29 to October 3, 1988), STS-36 (February 28 to March 4, 1990), and STS-42 (January 22\u201330, 1992). Space flight experience STS-51-J Atlantis , a classified Department of Defense mission, launched from Kennedy Space Center , Florida , on October 3, 1985. This was the maiden voyage of the Orbiter Atlantis . Hilmers had prime responsibility for a number of on-orbit activities during the mission. After 98 hours of orbital operations, Atlantis landed at Edwards Air Force Base , California, on October 7, 1985. STS-26 Discovery , the first mission to be flown after the Challenger accident , was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 29, 1988. During the four-day mission, the crew successfully deployed the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-C), which was subsequently carried to orbit by the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) rocket.

Hilmers replaced Manley Lanier \"Sonny\" Carter Jr. , killed in a plane crash, for his last mission. STS-42 Discovery launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on January 22, 1992. Fifty-five major experiments conducted in the International Microgravity Laboratory-1 module were provided by investigators from eleven countries, and represented a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines. During 128 orbits of the Earth, the STS-42 crew accomplished the mission's primary objective of investigating the effects of microgravity on materials processing and life sciences. In this unique laboratory in space, crew members worked around-the-clock in two shifts. Experiments investigated the microgravity effects on the growth of protein and semiconductor crystals. Biological experiments on the effects of zero gravity on plants, tissues, bacteria, insects and human vestibular response were also conducted. This eight-day mission culminated in a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on January 30, 1992. Post-NASA experience Hilmers decided to apply to medical school while training for his third shuttle flight. He attended pre-med courses at night while training for his fourth flight.

{"id": "doc_fixed_122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaconing", "text": "Meaconing is the interception and rebroadcast of navigation signals. These signals are rebroadcast on the received frequency, typically with power higher than the original signal, to confuse enemy navigation. Consequently, aircraft or ground stations are given inaccurate bearings. Meaconing is more of a concern to personnel in navigation ratings than to radio operators. However, communications transmitters are often used to transmit navigation signals. Since communications personnel operate the transmitters, they must know how to deal with any communications problems resulting from meaconing. Successful meaconing can cause aircraft to be lured into \"hot\" (ambush-ready) landing zones or enemy airspace, ships to be diverted from their intended routes, bombers to expend ordnance on false targets, or ground stations to receive inaccurate bearings or position locations. The term 'meacon' is a portmanteau of masking beacon . Alleged cases of meaconing Iran says it used this technique (among others) to capture a USAF RQ-170 Sentinel drone, causing it to crash land. Meaconing in this case could provide a drone with false altitude measurements, causing a crash landing. Acronym MIJI (Meaconing, Intrusion, Jamming, and Interference) In popular culture In the film Tomorrow Never Dies , a military GPS signal is meaconed to send a Royal Navy frigate off course. In the novel and miniseries of the John J. Nance novel Pandora's Clock , an attempt to warn the airliner about an impending attack is summarily dismissed as an attempt at meaconing. The villain of Die Hard 2 changes the Dulles Airport 's ATC beacon altitude to below ground level, causing planes' altimeters to provide false readings, thus causing landing planes to crash.

{"id": "doc_fixed_123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_M._MacEachran", "text": "John Malcolm MacEachran (January 16, 1877 \u2013 1971) was a Canadian philosopher and psychologist , whose most notable credentials involved the development of the Psychology and Philosophy Department at the University of Alberta . He was a co-founder of the Canadian Psychological Association and the appointed Chairman of the Alberta Eugenics Board which was responsible for approving the sterilization of thousands of Albertans , hundreds of which were without consent. Early years (1877-1909) John Malcolm MacEachran was born in Glencoe , Ontario in Canada to David and Christina MacEachran. After finishing his primary education in the public school system of Glencoe, he was admitted to Queen's University in Ontario. There, MacEachran obtained an MA in Mental and Moral Philosophy (1902), became the appointed assistant to Professor John Watson , and obtained his first PhD in 1906. Following his apprenticeship, MacEachran traveled to Berlin , Germany , where he worked with the well-known scholars Friedrich Paulsen and Carl Stumpf , further increasing his knowledge of modern psychology, ethics , and the philosophy of education . MacEachran then officially commenced schooling in Germany where he became a student of the psychologist/philosopher Wilhelm Wundt at the Leipzig University (1907). Here he wrote his doctoral thesis Der Pragmatismus (1909) earning him his second PhD. MacEachran then traveled to Paris where he studied sociology under \u00c9mile Durkheim and took a class under Alfred Binet , who had recently developed the IQ test (1908). MacEachran's academic relationship with Henri Bergson spurred his interest in combining the disciplines of philosophy and biological science. Dr. MacEachran accepted an offer from the then newly founded University of Alberta to head its Department of Philosophy and Psychology in 1909. University of Alberta years (1909-1945) In 1909, J.M. MacEachran was appointed head of the Department of Psychology and Philosophy at the University of Alberta. As the head of a new department, MacEachran fabricated the curriculum from scratch and in his first year at the U of A, MacEachran offered introductory courses in experimental and modern psychology . As the program developed, MacEachran made junior and senior level courses available and in 1911, he made it possible to graduate with a M.A and B.A in the field of psychology. Other classes that were added to the curriculum included: psychology and logic , comparative psychology (animal evolution , child psychology and racial psychology), physiological psychology , abnormal psychology and psychology of religion . At this point, MacEachran had developed and supported the whole of the undergraduate philosophy and psychology programs and supervised at least one Masters level student. He MacEachran also began administrative duties for the university in 1911, and officially accepted the position as the University of Alberta's first Provost in 1912. All of these responsibilities earned him a salary of $4,900. During the First World War (1916-1918), J.M. MacEachran enlisted as captain in the 196th Western Universities Battalion on March 15, 1916. He also served with the 19th Reserve Battalion , the C.E.F. Young Soldiers' Battalion , and the 13th Brigade C.F. in France . After MacEachran's return to the University of Alberta after World War I (1918), a central focus was developing applied psychology. Courses such as applied psychology, educational psychology , industrial psychology , legal psychology and psychology and economic problems were introduced into the curriculum. While studying at Leipzig University , Wilhelm Wundt lectured to MacEachran that experimental psychology would have to be meticulously studied for two or three centuries before it was to be applied \u2013 MacEachran installed applied psychology at the University of Alberta only one decade later. In 1938 MacEachran co-founded the Canadian Psychological Association and became the first honorary President in 1939. With the additional faculty, the number and range of classes broadened. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, laboratory psychology was crafted. In August 1945, after shaping the Department of Philosophy and Psychology, and much of the Universities' administrative routine, MacEachran retired as Emeritus Professor of Philosophy. His successor was John MacDonald. In 1960 the Department of Philosophy and Psychology split into independent departments. Alberta Eugenics Board (1928-1965) J.M. MacEachran was appointed Head of Alberta Eugenics Board in 1928, immediately after the Alberta government enacted the Sexual Sterilization Act . MacEachran was appointed Chairman for the purpose of developing a philosophical justification for the eugenics movement. He was an ideal candidate for the position because of his extensive background in philosophy and psychology. The purpose of the Alberta Eugenics board is outlined in section 4(1) of the Sexual Sterilization Act : Section 4(1) of the Sexual Sterilization Act empowered the medical superintendent of a mental hospital to cause a patient of the mental hospital whom it proposed to discharge to be examined by or in the presence of the eugenics board, with a view to sterilization. Section 5 of the Act established two grounds for sterilization: that procreation by the person under consideration would result in the transmission of any mental disability or deficiency to his or her progeny or involved the risk of mental injury either to such a person or his or her progeny. J.M MacEachran of Edmonton (U of A, Chairman), E.L. Pope of Edmonton (U of A, Professor of Medicine ), E.G. Mason of Calgary , and Mrs J.H Field of Spurfield (Secretary) were the original four members of the board whose job was to approve or reject patients for sterilization with respect to the guidelines of the Sexual Sterilization Act . Five years after the first meeting of the Alberta Eugenics Board in 1929, at the annual meeting of the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) in 1934, it was noted that 288 cases had been approved by the Eugenics Board for sterilization, and that 60% of these cases involved serious mental or nervous disease in the patients family record. Two classes of individuals were sterilized - those with low mental IQ's and those who had suffered serious mental breakdowns, and therefore could not be recommended for parenthood by any physician . It was also noted that any operations to be completed on the patients first required personal consent, or consent from family. If no one was eligible to provide consent and the patient was not capable of signing personal consent due to physical or mental barriers, the Minister of Health could do so. In 1933, the Eugenics Board consented that the Chairman, Dr. MacEachran, would have the authority to dictate when an operation for sterilization would take place. Members of the CMA, agreed: Evidence [had] shown overwhelmingly that sterilization [was] a sound, humane and effective procedure, and [was] one of the chief means of coping with the grave problem of the increasingly large number of mentally sick and mentally deficient persons that each province [was] being called upon to care for. In 1937, the Social Credit government passed an amendment that strongly restricted the need for the Eugenics Board to obtain the consent of the patients to be sterilized. This increased the efficiency of the sterilization process, as more patients could be approved for sterilization by the Eugenics board. In the 44 years that the board was empowered by the government of Alberta, 2822 sterilizations were processed. MacEachran resigned from Chairman of the Alberta Eugenics Board on June 30, 1965, serving for 38 consecutive years. During his term as Chairman, MacEachran signed over 3200 applications approving for sterilization of adults and children (~60% of approvals resulted in sterilizations). His successor was R.K. Thomson who was chairman until 1972 when the Sexual Sterilization Act was repealed. University of Alberta ceases honours in MacEachran's name (1990s) In 1975, the University of Alberta's Department of Psychology inaugurated an annual lecture series honouring MacEachran. Every year a distinguished scholar of psychology would be invited to give a lecture to students and faculty in MacEachran's honor. Awards and scholarships were also distributed in MacEachran's honour, first in 1958 and then 1972 with endowments from his estate. After 1972, the Faculty of Education and the Departments of Philosophy and Psychology awarded annual scholarships to students honouring MacEachran's accomplishments. On September 3, 1997, a committee at the University of Alberta voted to rename the lecture series due to MacEachran's involvement in the unlawful sterilization of many Albertans. In 1998, a University of Alberta panel submitted a request to halt the distribution of awards in J.M. MacEachran's name. This request was based on data obtained from the Leilani Muir versus the Province of Alberta trial, which showed that many of the sterilizations were unlawfully approved by the Alberta Eugenics Board. The board, headed by J.M. MacEachran, approved sterilizations without clear evidence that the patient's deficiencies would be transmitted to their progeny. The board approved sterilizations of patients who did not fall into the category of \"mentally defective\". A section of the Sterilization Act stated that upon sterilization, the patient would be discharged from the holding facility and in many instances, patients were sterilized even though discharge was not imminent. The board also approved the sterilization of patients already known to be infertile (patients with Down syndrome ). Furthermore, castrations were approved in order to obtain testicular tissue for research purposes. The board approved sterilizations with the understanding that patient's sexual behaviour would be altered, therefore eliminating sexual deviancy, and also with the goal of stopping menstruation in women. MacEachran had also signed application forms, approving sterilization before the patients had been interviewed by the board. With regards to the Leilani Muir vs. Alberta trial, Madame Justice Joanne B. Veit noted: Dr. Thompson's [a former chair holder of the Alberta Eugenics Board] evidence demonstrates that the operations of the Board initiated on a purported scientific rationale, degenerated into unscientific practices. The decisions of the Board were not made according to the standards imposed on them by the legislation, but because the members of the Board... thought that it was socially appropriate to control reproduction of \"these people\". Because of the previously stated reasons, in 1998, the Department of Philosophy at the University of Alberta stopped giving out rewards honouring MacEachran's name. A single MacEachran award was given out in 2003 from the Department of Philosophy, and then no more thereafter.

The team plays its home games at Saxon Stadium , located on the campus of Mercyhurst University . The SeaWolves adopted the name \"Commodores\" to honor Oliver Hazard Perry , a U.S. Navy commodore who commanded forces from Erie's Presque Isle Bay during the Battle of Lake Erie , a pivotal event in the War of 1812 . Perry's flagship, the USS Niagara , flew the iconic \"Don't Give up the Ship\" battle flag, both elements featured in the Commodores' logo. The Erie Maritime Museum now maintains the Niagara at Presque Isle Bay. History In 2009, local soccer coach Pedro Arg\u00e1ez founded Erie Admirals SC , building upon an existing youth program. John Melody, a former player at Mercyhurst University, initially served as head coach and later took full ownership of the club. On April 24, 2015, Melody rebranded the team as Erie Commodores FC . He appointed Micky Blythe\u2014a fellow Mercyhurst alumnus\u2014as head coach for one season, followed by Neil Brown (holding a UEFA\u202fA License) for the 2015 NPSL campaign. In 2021, they announced addition of a senior women's team to its overall program, to play in the United Women's Soccer League Two. Player development Several Commodores alums have advanced to professional soccer, including: Adam Clement, signed by Vancouver Whitecaps FC (MLS) Sam Dorf, signed by Waterford FC (League of Ireland 1st Division) Jeremy Deighton , Greg Blum, and Neil Shaffer , who played with Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC (USL) Danny Deakin , drafted by Orlando City SC in the 2017 MLS SuperDraft Rust\u2011Belt rivalries and venue changes The Commodores developed rivalries with fellow Rust Belt Conference teams, such as Cleveland SC . In 2020, the club participated in the NPSL Members Cup, alongside Cleveland SC, FC Buffalo , and Pittsburgh Hotspurs . They also contested the Erie County Derby against FC Buffalo until Buffalo's move to USL League Two in 2023. From 2013 to 2021, the team played at McConnell Family Stadium on the campus of Gannon University . In 2022, the Commodores relocated to Saxon Stadium on the Mercyhurst University campus, a facility that seats approximately 2,300 spectators and features a synthetic turf playing surface. Brewers Cup In 2024, Erie revived its rivalry with FC Buffalo through the Erie County Brewers Cup, sponsored by John Russell Brewing (Erie) and Big Ditch Brewing (Buffalo). The two-leg series featured a commissioned tropical IPA, \"Lake Erie Life,\" released by the collaborating breweries. 2025 season During the 2025 NPSL campaign, Erie qualified for the Great Lakes conference playoffs by defeating Cleveland SC on July 5, marking another strong season under the club's continued leadership.

{"id": "doc_fixed_126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battleships_of_Italy", "text": "Battleship Roma in 1940 Starting in the 1890s, the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) began building a series of modern battleships. Early designs were marked by their small size, light armor, and high speed compared to contemporary foreign counterparts. The first pre-dreadnought battleship design, the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class , was constrained by budgetary limits imposed by the legislature. Two ships were ordered by the class's namesake, Admiral Simone de Pacoret Saint Bon , though the design was also influenced by Benedetto Brin , who replaced di Saint Bon as naval minister after his death. Brin designed the next pair of battleships, the Regina Margherita class . These ships were larger than the preceding class, and were intended to challenge the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg -class battleships then under construction. Brin himself died during the construction process. Vittorio Cuniberti designed the next class of small pre-dreadnoughts, the Regina Elena class , which were the fastest battleships in the world at the time of their completion. These ships all served in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911\u20131912, where they were primarily used to provide naval gunfire support for the Italian ground troops, as the Ottoman Navy largely confined itself to port. By the time that the Regina Elena s had been built in the early 1900s, the British battleship HMS\u00a0 Dreadnought had been completed, a revolutionary design that rendered all previous battleships obsolete. Therefore, a new dreadnought-type battleship was needed. The new ship was Dante Alighieri , and was designed by Rear Admiral Edoardo Masdea . The Italian Navy built five further battleships to two similar designs: the Conte di Cavour and Andrea Doria classes . These six dreadnoughts formed the core of the Italian fleet during World War I , as a further four-ship class was cancelled. Both the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies adopted cautious fleet policies and neither chose to risk their capital ships in a major engagement; as a result, the Italian battle line spent the war in harbor and did not see combat. Nevertheless, the dreadnought Leonardo da Vinci was destroyed by a magazine explosion in August 1916. The pre-dreadnought Benedetto Brin was also destroyed by an internal explosion in September 1915, and her sister Regina Margherita was sunk by a German mine in December 1916. The remaining battleships of the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon and Regina Elena classes were discarded after the end of the war. In the interwar period , the Italian Navy\u2014along with the rest of the major naval powers\u2014was limited by the Washington Naval Treaty , which granted Italy parity with the French Navy. The Italians had 70,000 long tons (71,000\u00a0t) worth of battleship tonnage available for new vessels before they would reach their treaty limits, but they avoided new construction in the 1920s due to severe budgetary problems and to avoid a naval arms race with France. These financial limitations also forced the Italians to scrap Dante Alighieri in 1928. Nevertheless, the Regia Marina decided to make use of its excess tonnage by the early 1930s, which resulted in the four Littorio -class battleships . Two were finished early in World War II and were used extensively to escort convoys during the North African Campaign . The third ship, Roma , was finished in 1942, but was sunk in September 1943 by a German radio-controlled bomb when Italy surrendered to the Allies. The fourth ship, Impero , was never finished and was instead sunk by American bombers and scrapped after the end of the war. The two surviving ships, Littorio and Vittorio Veneto , were surrendered to the Allies and were later broken up for scrap. Of the surviving members of the Conte di Cavour class, Conte di Cavour was scrapped after the end of the war and Giulio Cesare was surrendered to the Soviet Union as war reparations. Only the two Andrea Doria -class battleships survived in Italian service for any significant length of time after the conclusion of hostilities; both served as training ships until the mid-1950s, when they too were broken up for scrap. Pre-dreadnought battleships Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class Ammiraglio di Saint Bon underway Main article: Ammiraglio di Saint Bon -class battleship The first of the Italian Navy's modern battleships, the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class were smaller than their contemporaries due to limitations imposed by the Italian government and indecision in the naval design staff over what kind of battleship should be built. They were designed under the supervision of Admiral Simone di Pacoret Saint Bon , the namesake of the lead ship , and Benedetto Brin . Ultimately, the ships' small size, weak main battery, and slow speed made them ineffective capital ships, since they were not strong enough to engage foreign battleships, and too slow to catch cruisers. Both ships served in the active duty squadron early in their careers, and participated in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911\u20131912. They took part in the Italian offensives in North Africa and the island of Rhodes , but did not see combat with the Ottoman fleet. They were reduced to harbor defense ships by the outbreak of World War I , and spent the war in Venice . The ships were discarded shortly after the end of the war, both having been stricken in 1920. Regina Margherita class Regina Margherita on sea trials in 1904 Main article: Regina Margherita -class battleship The pattern of experimentation in Italian capital ship construction continued with the Regina Margherita class. The negative experience with the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class convinced the constructors, led by Benedetto Brin, to design a larger battleship that could engage its foreign counterparts. The new class was designed specifically to counter the new Habsburg -class battleships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy . For this purpose, the ships were armed with the 12-inch (305\u00a0mm) gun that had become standard for most pre-dreadnought battleships of the day. As was typical for Italian capital ships of the period, armor protection was reduced in order to secure high speed. Brin died during the construction process, and the Italian Navy named the second vessel after him. The two ships also saw action in the Italo-Turkish War, alongside the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class in the 3rd Division of the fleet. Benedetto Brin took part in the attack on Tripoli in October 1911, and both ships were involved in the campaign to seize Rhodes in the eastern Aegean Sea . The Regina Margherita class had become obsolete by the outbreak of World War I and had been reduced to training ships. Both were lost during the war: Benedetto Brin to an internal explosion in Brindisi in September 1915, and Regina Margherita to a German mine in December 1916. Regina Elena class Regina Elena 1907 Main article: Regina Elena -class battleship The final class of Italian pre-dreadnoughts were designed by Vittorio Cuniberti , the naval architect whose projected design for the first \"all-big-gun\" battleship would quickly make the Regina Elena class obsolescent. These ships sacrificed two of the 12-inch guns to obtain a powerful secondary battery of twelve 8-inch (203\u00a0mm) guns. Their high speed\u2014the fastest of any battleship then built, including the revolutionary, turbine -powered HMS\u00a0 Dreadnought \u2014permitted them to also engage cruisers. All four ships served in the 1st Division of the Italian fleet during the Italo-Turkish War, and were the workhorses of the operations off North Africa and in the eastern Mediterranean. During World War I, the ships were primarily based in Brindisi, Taranto , and Valona ; they saw no action during the war due to the cautious fleet policies adopted by both the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies. The ships remained in the Italian fleet for a few years after the war, but all were discarded and broken up for scrap by 1927. Dreadnoughts Dante Alighieri Dante Alighieri at high speed Main article: Italian battleship Dante Alighieri Dante Alighieri was the first dreadnought battleship built by the Italian Navy, and was designed by Rear Admiral Edoardo Masdea . Cuniberti's call for heavy artillery arranged to emphasize broadside fire led to the placement of four triple 12-inch gun turrets along the centerline. This allowed a broadside of all twelve guns, while the first generation of British dreadnoughts could only fire eight of their guns on the broadside. Dante Alighieri was the first battleship to mount her main battery in triple turrets, though the Austro-Hungarian SMS\u00a0 Viribus Unitis was completed first. The ship had a very limited service life. At the outbreak of World War I, she was the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron, based in Taranto. But due to the policy of restraint adopted by the Italian Navy, Dante Alighieri and the other battleships of the Italian fleet saw no action. Financial limitations in the post-war period forced the navy to scrap the ship to reduce the naval budget. The ship was accordingly stricken on 1 July 1928 and sold for scrap. Conte di Cavour class Conte di Cavour as originally built Main article: Conte di Cavour -class battleship The first design in the second generation of Italian dreadnoughts, the Conte di Cavour class was also designed by Edoardo Masdea. They were ordered in response to the French Courbet -class battleships . They remedied many of the deficiencies of the previous design; the most significant improvement was a dramatically more effective arrangement of the main battery. Ten guns were arranged in twin turrets superfiring over triple turrets forward and aft, and a third triple turret was placed amidships . All thirteen guns could fire on the broadside, but the firing arcs for most of the guns were significantly improved. The three ships had limited careers during World War I, and did not see action. On the night of 2/3 August 1916, Leonardo da Vinci was sunk by an internal explosion. She was raised in 1919; the navy planned to repair and modernize her, but lacked sufficient funds, and she was sold in 1923. The two surviving ships were heavily rebuilt in the mid-1930s, and both saw action during World War II . On the night of 11/12 November 1940, both ships were attacked by British torpedo bombers in the Battle of Taranto . Conte di Cavour was badly damaged, and had not been fully repaired when Italy surrendered in September 1943. Giulio Cesare meanwhile escaped unscathed, and participated in the battles of Cape Spartivento and First Sirte in November 1940 and December 1941, respectively. After the end of the war, Conte di Cavour was scrapped, and Giulio Cesare was surrendered to the Soviet Union. Renamed Novorossiysk , she was ultimately sunk in October 1955 by an old German mine left over from World War II. Her wreck was later salvaged in 1957 and broken up thereafter. Andrea Doria class Andrea Doria after her reconstruction in 1937 Main article: Andrea Doria -class battleship Vice Admiral Giuseppe Valsecchi was responsible for the next battleship design, the Andrea Doria class. The class comprised two vessels\u2014 Andrea Doria and Duilio \u2014and the design was based on the previous Conte di Cavour with minor modifications. These two ships were ordered in response to the French Bretagne class . As with the Conte di Cavour s, the two Andrea Doria -class battleships were significantly modernized in the late 1930s along similar lines: the central turret was removed, the propulsion system was completely replaced with more efficient machinery, and the secondary battery was replaced with new turret-mounted guns. The two ships entered service in 1916, and were based in Taranto with the rest of the main fleet for the duration of World War I. Both ships were involved in the Corfu incident in 1923. The ships' modernization work was completed after Italy entered World War II. Duilio was damaged at the Battle of Taranto, while Andrea Doria was not hit. Both ships were present at the First Battle of Sirte, though only Andrea Doria engaged British forces. The two ships survived the war, and were the only battleships the Allies permitted Italy to retain after the conclusion of hostilities. They served in the Italian Navy for another decade until they were discarded in the mid-1950s. Francesco Caracciolo class Line-drawing of the Francesco Caracciolo class Main article: Francesco Caracciolo -class battleship The next Italian battleship design represented a major qualitative step forward. The design was prepared by Rear Admiral Edgardo Ferrati , and was intended to match the latest foreign battleships, such as the British Queen Elizabeth class . The new ships were to be armed with a main battery of eight 15\u00a0in (381\u00a0mm) guns and had a top speed of 28 knots (52\u00a0km/h; 32\u00a0mph), much faster than any contemporary design. The Francesco Caracciolo class was ordered in 1914; the lead ship was laid down that year, and the other three vessels were laid down in 1915. After Italy entered World War I in May 1915, work slowed dramatically, as resources were diverted to more pressing needs. Work on the ships stopped completely by March 1916, and the three ships begun in 1915 were scrapped shortly after the end of the war. In 1919, the Italian Navy considered completing Francesco Caracciolo as an aircraft carrier similar to the British HMS\u00a0 Argus or as a floatplane carrier, but both proposals were too expensive for the cash-strapped navy. Ultimately, she was broken up for scrap in 1926. Littorio class CG rendering of Roma Main article: Littorio -class battleship The final group of Italian battleships was the Littorio class. These ships, which weighed in excess of 40,000 long tons (41,000\u00a0t) standard displacement , violated the naval arms limitation system created by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. The ships were armed with a battery of nine 15-inch guns in three triple turrets, and they incorporated a novel underwater protection system designed by Umberto Pugliese . Littorio and Vittorio Veneto were laid down in 1934 and completed in early 1940; a second pair, Roma and Impero , were laid down in 1938. Roma was finished in mid-1942, while Impero was not completed. The first two ships entered service in August 1940, shortly after Italy joined World War II. Littorio was badly damaged in the November 1940 raid on Taranto, and repairs lasted until March 1941. Vittorio Veneto was undamaged, and later that month took part in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. In March 1941, she was damaged by British torpedo bombers after the Battle of Cape Matapan . Both ships were back in action for the First and Second Battle of Sirte in January and March 1942, respectively. By the end of the year, Roma was ready for service and replaced Littorio as the fleet flagship. After Benito Mussolini fell from power in July 1943, Littorio was renamed Italia . During the Italian surrender in September 1943, Roma was hit by a pair of Fritz-X guided glide bombs; her ammunition magazines blew up in a tremendous explosion and she quickly sank.

{"id": "doc_fixed_127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_I_Never_Knew", "text": "The Jesus I Never Knew is a popular 1995 Christological book by the American Christian author Philip Yancey . It won the Gold Medallion Book Award and ECPA Christian Book of the Year 1996: it is a book that appeals to the wider Christian public for its personal approach to the figure of Jesus , with a fresh and vivid portrayal extracted from a dynamic reading of the four canonical gospels . Synopsis With this book, Yancey intends to offer a new and different perspective on the life of Christ and his work \u2013 his teaching, his miracles , his death and resurrection \u2013 and ultimately, who he was and why he came. The author chronicles his journey of discovery, looking past traditionally perpetuated beliefs about Jesus and reporting facts about him and his teaching as recorded by the authors of the gospels . Juxtaposing the Gospel events with the world we live in today, The Jesus I Never Knew gives a dynamic portrait of this central figure of history. The author examines some of the radical words of Jesus with a willingness to tackle the difficult questions raised by them, and asks whether today Christians are taking them seriously enough. Yancey affirms: \"No one who meets Jesus ever stays the same. In the end I found the process of writing this book to be a great act of faith-strengthening. Jesus has rocked my own preconceptions and has made me ask hard questions about why those of us who bear his name don't do a better job of following him.\" Candidly recalling his own journey of rediscovery of Jesus, Yancey demonstrates to his readers the arc of many Christians' intellectual faith walk. First he addresses possible misconceptions about Jesus physical appearance (probably not tall and gaunt, based on what one knows today of Jews of the time), moves onto his character, and his interactions with people and his disciples. He sincerely questions preconceived notions about who Jesus was and is, drawing from a number of sources including many of Hollywood 's various celluloid representations. Right through the book, Yancey creates what is essentially a prose harmony of the Gospels, reconstructing Jesus life, challenges, and teachings in a fluid and easy language. The text is not academical, but the research is meticulous and diverse, with sections exploring essential questions, whilst others remind the reader of significant details of Jesus' life one may take for granted: \"Distrusting crowds and public opinion, he spent most of his time in towns of small size and little importance\" (p.\u00a092). While Yancey could have speculated about how Jesus' ministry would have been different had it been concentrated in a major metropolis (ultimately irrelevant), his reminder of this detail shines additional light on the wonder that Jesus' ministry became a worldwide phenomenon.

Views on Jesus Jesuism Jews for Jesus Redeemer (Christianity) Lost years of Jesus Related lists List of books about Jesus List of founders of religious traditions List of people claimed to be Jesus List of people who have been considered deities Notes ^ American Christian evangelist Billy Graham , in commenting this book and its author, stated; \"There is no writer in the evangelical world that I admire and appreciate more.\" [1] . ^ Yancey's purpose in presenting this book is to reintroduce readers to Jesus by focusing the reader's attention on Jesus as a man who was born human, lived a fantastic and unpredictable life, taught how to live against the grain, offered paradigm shifts in the understanding of God, loved the simple and despised the self-righteous, and ultimately died to fulfill his mission. Walter Wink sums up the complex, incredible life of Jesus by saying, \"If Jesus had never lived, we would not have been able to invent him.\" Cf. Pt. 1, Ch. 1, pp. 23-25. ^ Cit. int. al., Jesus of Nazareth , The Gospel According to St. Matthew , The King of Kings , Godspell . More than once, Yancey references Jesus' reputation among his contemporaries as \"a wine-bibber and a glutton\" ( Ibid. , p.15, pp.86-87 - cf. Matthew 11:18\u201319 ), which certainly must go against any contemporary Christian's beliefs about Jesus' actions and character. ^ Cf. Ibid . pp.91-96.

Wilson was the first Marine Corps commandant to serve full-time on the Joint Chiefs of Staff . Awards and decorations Wilson was the recipient of the following awards: Medal of Honor citation The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to CAPTAIN LOUIS H. WILSON, JR . UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS for service as set forth in the following CITATION: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as Commanding Officer of Company F, Second Battalion, Ninth Marines, Third Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces at Fonte Hill, Guam, Marianas Islands, 25 and July 26, 1944. Ordered to take that portion of the hill within his zone of action, Captain Wilson initiated his attack in midafternoon, pushed up the rugged, open terrain against terrific machine-gun and rifle fire for 300 yards and successfully captured the objective. Promptly assuming command of other disorganized units and motorized equipment in addition to his own company and one reinforcing platoon, he organized his night defenses in the face of continuous hostile fire and, although wounded three times during this five-hour period, completed his disposition of men and guns before retiring to the company command post for medical attention. Shortly thereafter, when the enemy launched the first of a series of savage counterattacks lasting all night, he voluntarily rejoined his besieged units and repeatedly exposed himself to the merciless hail of shrapnel and bullets, dashing fifty yards into the open on one occasion to rescue a wounded Marine lying helpless beyond the front lines. Fighting fiercely in hand-to-hand encounters , he led his men in furiously waged battle for approximately ten hours, tenaciously holding his line and repelling the fanatically renewed counterthrusts until he succeeded in crushing the last efforts of the hard-pressed Japanese early the following morning. Then, organizing a seventeen-man patrol, he immediately advanced upon a strategic slope essential to the security of his position and, boldly defying intense mortar , machine-gun and rifle fire which struck down thirteen of his men, drove relentlessly forward with the remnants of his patrol to seize the vital ground. By his indomitable leadership, daring combat tactics and dauntless valor in the face of overwhelming odds, Captain Wilson succeeded in capturing and holding the strategic high ground in his regimental sector, thereby contributing essentially to the success of his regimental mission and to the annihilation of 350 Japanese troops. His inspiring conduct throughout the critical periods of this decisive action enhanced and sustained the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service . /S/ HARRY S. TRUMAN Post-military Wilson retired on June 30, 1979, and returned to his home in Mississippi. For \"exceptionally distinguished service\" during his four-year tenure as commandant, and his contributions as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he received the Defense Distinguished Service Medal (first oak leaf cluster ), upon retirement. Wilson died at his home in Birmingham, Alabama , on June 21, 2005. As with all former Marine Corps commandants, in accordance with Article 1288 of Navy Regulations, all ships and stations of the Department of the Navy flew the national flag at half-mast from the time of Wilson's death until sunset of the date of interment.

In 1803 he was appointed to the newly built 74-gun HMS\u00a0 Colossus and afterwards to the 90-gun HMS\u00a0 Barfleur , in which he took part in the Battle of Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805, and later in the blockade of Brest under Admiral William Cornwallis . In November 1808 he was promoted to lieutenant of HMS\u00a0 Dannemark , and served in her at the reduction of Flushing in August 1809. In 1812 he was a lieutenant of the 74-gun HMS\u00a0 Clarence in the Bay of Biscay . Post-war and first commands Glascock afterwards served in a number of frigates on the home station, successively HMS\u00a0 Tiber , HMS\u00a0 Madagascar , and HMS\u00a0 Maeander , and in the 32-gun HMS Sir Francis Drake , flagship of Sir Charles Hamilton on the Newfoundland Station . He was promoted from her to the command of the sloop HMS\u00a0 Carnation in November 1818. In 1819 he commanded the brig HMS\u00a0 Drake , from which he was obliged to resign as an invalid. In 1830 Glascock was appointed to the sloop HMS\u00a0 Orestes , which he commanded on the home station during 1831, but in 1832 he was sent to the coast of Portugal, and during the latter months of the year was stationed in the Douro , for the protection of British interests in the disturbed state of the country during the Liberal Wars . Glascock continued in the Douro, as senior officer, for nearly a year, during which time his conduct under troublesome and often difficult circumstances won for him the approval of the Admiralty and promotion to post-rank, on 3 June 1833, accompanied by a special and complimentary letter from Sir James Graham , the first lord . He did not, however, leave the Douro until the following September, and on 1 October he paid off the Orestes . From April 1843 to January 1847 he commanded the frigate HMS\u00a0 Tyne on the Mediterranean station, and during the following months was employed in Ireland as an inspector under the Poor Relief Act . He died suddenly on 8 October 1847 at Baltinglass . He was married and left children. Writing career Glascock devoted the long intervals of half-pay , both as commander and captain, to writing, and produced several volumes of naval novels, anecdotes, reminiscences, and reflections. His biographer in the Dictionary of National Biography , J. K. Laughton remarked that \"as novels, [they] are stupid enough, and in their historical parts have little value, but are occasionally interesting as social sketches of naval life in the early part of the century.\" Glascock wrote a two-volume work, The Naval Sketch Book, or The Service Afloat and Ashore , published in 1826. This was followed by the three-volume Sailors and Saints, or Matrimonial Man\u0153uvres in 1829, Tales of a Tar, with Characteristic Anecdotes in 1836, and the three-volume Land Sharks and Sea Gulls in 1838. He also wrote a two-volume work entitled Naval Service, or Officers' Manual , published in 1836. This useful manual for young officers passed through four editions in England. The last, published in 1859, had a short advertisement by Glascock's daughter, stating that \"the work has been translated into French, Russian, Swedish, and Turkish, and adopted by the navies of those powers, as well as by that of the United States.\" Laughton remarked that the work was \"of course, quite obsolete, though still interesting to the student of naval history and customs.\" See also O'Byrne, William Richard (1849). \"Glascock, William Nugent\"\u00a0 .

His real name was Franz . A student of Commerce , he moved from Heidelberg to Geneva in 1912, so that he could follow his studies. He would live in Geneva the rest of his life. There he started to work for the World Esperanto Association , of which he had been a member since 1909. In 1934 he resigned from the role of Director , as a form of protest, and started working elsewhere. In the end, he worked in an office of the Swiss federation until he retired. He got married two times, and had a daughter. He was a member of the Swiss Socialist Party . Jakob and Esperanto In 1920 Jakob became the director of the central office of UEA; he cared after the publication of Jarlibroj and after the magazine Esperanto . He became General Director of the World Esperanto Association in 1924; he left the post in 1934, when he resigned, as a form of protest, during the World Esperanto Congress in Stockholm . Since 1936, when the association split into two branches (headquartered respectively in Geneva and London), he began once again to serve as a redactor for the Genevan association. After the reunification of the two associations, in 1947, he joined the governing council of the reborn UEA and started caring after the magazine. In 1955 he resigned from all the posts as a form of protest, but he was nevertheless awarded the title \"honorary redactor\". In 1960 the governing council of UEA learnt that Jakob had been unduly taking some money from the association; a years-long judicial procedure followed suit. When Jakob died, in 1967, UEA inherited part of his money.

His performances as goalkeeper under the leadership of coach Richard P\u00e1ez , and later C\u00e9sar Far\u00edas , for the national team made him an important player in Venezuelan football 's emergent recent history. Club career Venezuela and Europe In 1997, Vega traveled to Italy to play in the youth ranks of Udinese . However, he returned to Venezuela in 1998, joining Nacional T\u00e1chira , a first division club of his country.

In 2006, he was signed by Carabobo , playing 29 games in the club. In 2007, because of his good performances with the national team and his club, he was transferred to Turkish club Bursaspor , being this his second adventure in the old continent. He established himself as the Turkish club's top keeper and appeared in 22 league matches. After his spell at Bursaspor, he joined to Denizlispor , playing only one friendly game for the club.

After five-match unbeaten with him in goal and caretaker coach Luis P\u00e9rez since one-nil over San Felipe (between Torneo Apertura 's regular phase and playoffs), on 24 June, he conceded four goals in rematch semifinal against Universidad de Chile, after having won 2\u20130 in first leg at Macul , where Vega made a well game. International career In 1998, Vega was named the best keeper of the Primera Divisi\u00f3n youth ranks and one year later was listed in the Copa Am\u00e9rica 22\u2013man squad of Venezuela national team by the Argentine coach Jos\u00e9 Omar Pastoriza . He made his international debut on 30 July 1999 against Brazil , in where his team lost 7\u20130, in a match that Ronaldinho realized a very well goal, who made an incredible dribbling that passed over the head of the centre back Jos\u00e9 Manuel Rey . Three seasons later, Renny was called\u2013up by Richard P\u00e1ez to the 2001 Copa Am\u00e9rica held in Colombia , not making an international appearance.

{"id": "doc_fixed_139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchase_Parkway", "text": "The Julian M. Carroll Purchase Parkway was the designation for a 52.3-mile (84.2\u00a0km) freeway in the U.S. state of Kentucky that ran between the Tennessee state line at Fulton and US\u00a062 in Calvert City . It began concurrent with U.S. Route\u00a051 (US 51) only a few yards from an intersection with US\u00a045W , US\u00a045E , and US\u00a045 at its southern terminus. It was one of seven highways that are part of the Kentucky Parkway System . The parkway was upgraded to Interstate Highway standards and incorporated into I-69 in two phases. The northern half between US\u00a045 Bypass in Mayfield and I-24 near Calvert City was redesignated as I-69 in July 2018. The interchange with I-24 was reconstructed from a basic cloverleaf interchange to include a pair of direct high-speed connectors for I-69 through traffic continuing east concurrent with I-24, with the northernmost 1.67 miles (2.69\u00a0km) of the parkway becoming exit\u00a051A-B (unsigned KY\u00a02602 ) and facilitating access to westbound I-24 and US\u00a062 for northbound traffic. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC) acquired and closed the nearby Kentucky Lake Motor Speedway in 2015 via eminent domain for the reconstruction of the interchange. The southern half of the parkway from the Tennessee state line in Fulton to US\u00a045 Bypass in Mayfield was redesignated as I-69 in December 2024. History The Purchase Parkway formerly used a light blue shield. Federal legislation designated the entire length of the Purchase Parkway as I-69 in 2002. On June 6, 2008, President George W. Bush signed HR 1195 (SAFETEA-LU Technical Corrections Act of 2008), reaffirming the I-69 designation for the Purchase Parkway and further authorizing Kentucky to sign the route as such with Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approval. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet had planned I-69 signs on the parkway during the summer of 2008, but the FHWA required the KYTC to either upgrade substandard portions of the route or obtain a design waiver before the parkway could be signed as I-69. On July 6, 2018, a 30-mile segment of the parkway was re-designated as Interstate 69, and the parkway was truncated to exit 21 in Mayfield The northernmost stub of the Purchase Parkway between I-24/I-69 and US-62 (now unsigned KY\u00a02602 ) is now signed as \"TO US-62\" in the northbound direction and \"TO I-24/I-69\" in the southbound direction. Originally named Purchase Parkway for the Jackson Purchase area it diagonally traverses, the road was renamed for Julian Carroll , a former Kentucky governor from McCracken County , in 2001. The Purchase Parkway carried the unsigned designation of Kentucky Route 9003 ( JC 9003 ). The Mayfield Bypass, which was incorporated into the parkway following its construction, is also signed as US\u00a045 Bypass . Transition to Interstate 69 The Julian M. Carroll Purchase Parkway from the junction with Interstate 24 west was legally designated to become part of I-69 . On May 15, 2006, Governor Ernie Fletcher announced that the Purchase Parkway would become part of the alignment of I-69 in Kentucky, along with parts of I-24, the Edward T. Breathitt Pennyrile Parkway , and the Wendell H. Ford Western Kentucky Parkway . To reflect this, Future I-69 shields were erected along the parkway in the middle of 2006. Additional federal legislation enacted in 2008 confirmed the route of I-69, and authorized Kentucky to immediately begin signing the Purchase Parkway (and parts of the Western Kentucky Parkway and Pennyrile Parkway ) as I-69, even though the parkways did not yet meet Interstate Highway standards . The reason the 2008 legislation (HR 1195) immediately applied the I-69 designation to the Purchase Parkway was to tap into federal Interstate Highway money to fund upgrades to the parkway. This is because Interstate Highway funds typically could not be used to upgrade an existing freeway until it is designated and signed as an Interstate. Median improvements near Mayfield , increased bridge heights to 16 feet (4.9\u00a0m), shoulder improvements, and interchange reconstructions will all need to take place to bring the alignment into federal compliance. No official funding has been set in the six-year plan stipulating modernization of the parkways that will be affected by I-69's routing, nor has any official study been completed. As a toll road Except for the Mayfield bypass, which remained free, the parkway was originally a toll road , as were all Kentucky parkways. State law requires that toll collection cease when enough tolls are collected to pay off the parkway's construction bonds; which in the case of the Purchase, occurred in 1992.

The family's branches are descended from John Ames, the son of a 17th-century settler of the Province of Massachusetts Bay . Numerous public and private works throughout the U.S. are named after family members, including the city Ames, Iowa , and the NASA Ames research center in California. Origins The scion of the American Ames family was William Ames, who was born in England to John Ames and Cyprian Ames (n\u00e9e Brown) in 1605. The family's earliest known ancestor died in 1560. It is thought the family's surname was, at some point prior to emigration, changed from Amyas . In the 16th century Amyas was frequently confused with Ames. William Ames immigrated to Massachusetts Bay in 1638, eventually settled in Braintree , and died in about 1653. With his wife Hannah, he had one son, John, born in 1647.

{"id": "doc_fixed_141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perizzites", "text": "The Perizzites ( Hebrew : \u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b4\u05d6\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9 , romanized :\u00a0 P\u0259rizzi ) are a group of people mentioned many times in the Hebrew Bible as having lived in the land of Canaan before the arrival of the Israelites. The name may be related to a Hebrew term meaning \"rural person.\" History Biblical mentions of Perizzites extend from the time of Abraham (Genesis 13:7) to the time of Ezra and Nehemiah ( Ezra 9 :1\u20132). According to Michael LeFebvre, Ezra's reference to the Perizzites does not imply that a group still known as Perizzites existed in the land in Ezra's time. It is instead to be understood as a literary reference by Ezra to passages such as Exodus 34:11\u201316, Exodus 33:2 and Deuteronomy 7:1\u20135, which prohibited intermarriage with a variety of non-Israelite peoples, including Perizzites, among others. The time during which Perizzites were most in conflict with the Israelites seems to be the time of Joshua into the early period of the Judges. According to the Book of Joshua , the Perizzites were in the hill country of Judah and Ephraim (Joshua 11:3, 17:14\u201315). According to 1 Kings 9:21, they were servants to Solomon . According to Hittitologist Trevor R. Bryce , \"The Perizzites cannot be linked to any peoples or lands known from extra-biblical sources,\" but there are speculative links to the Hivites and the Jebusites , who may have originated from a region called Que in Assyrian sources or Kue/Quoah in biblical sources. Jewish Encyclopedia entry Canaanitic tribes settled in the south of Canaan between Hor and Negeb, although it is not mentioned in the genealogy in Gen. x. According to the Biblical references, Abraham, when he entered Canaan, found the Perizzites dwelling near the Canaanites (ib. xiii. 7), and God promised to destroy both these peoples (ib. xv. 20). Jacob reproved his sons because of the crime of Shechem, inasmuch as he feared the Perizzites and the Canaanites (ib. xxxiv. 30). Moses promised the Israelites to bring them unto the place of the Perizzites and the Amorites (Ex. xxx. 8); and at a later time the tribes of Simeon and Judah conquered the Canaanites and the Perizzites (Judges i. 4). The Perizzites were among the tribes that were not subjected to tribute by Solomon (I Kings ix. 20\u201322), while the complaint was brought to Ezra that the priests and the Levites would not separate themselves from the Perizzites and the other peoples of the land (Ezra ix. 1). The view was formerly held that the Perizzites were a prehistoric tribe which became assimilated to the Canaanites when the latter invaded Canaan; but this is in contradiction to the fact that the Perizzites are not mentioned in the genealogy. More recent commentators are of the opinion that the names \"Perizi\" and \"Perazi\" are identical, and that the Bible has included under the name \"Perizzites\" all stocks dwelling in unwalled towns.

{"id": "doc_fixed_145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondo_(putty)", "text": "Bondo is a polyester putty product originally marketed as an automotive body filler. Nowadays the brand name is used by 3M for a line of American-made products for automotive, marine and household repairs. The term Bondo is trademarked by 3M, but is commonly used to refer to any brand of automotive repair putty due to its popularity. It is also used by sculptors . History Before the 1950s, body solder was often used to repair large imperfections prior to painting in both new cars and vehicle repair shops. Solder repairs were conducted using a flame and wooden paddles covered in tallow or motor oil, which prevented the half-molten lead from sticking. After World War II , automotive panels became thinner and larger, with a greater susceptibility to warping, making hot solder unsuitable. The earliest 'plastic solder' can be traced to around 1940, a do-it-yourself solution to panel beating. This gave the consumer the ability to attempt reasonably priced and long lasting repairs. These early fillers were epoxy -based and one-part, drying by outgassing. Originally, the plastic fillers performed badly compared to solder, but later improvements addressed this. Bondo, a two-part mix ( resin with hardener added) of talc and plastic, was introduced in 1955. It was developed by WWII veteran and automotive repair shop owner Robert Merton Spink of Miami , Florida . Bondo was acquired by 3M in 2007.

{"id": "doc_fixed_147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencers_Building", "text": "Spencers Building is a pair of heritage-listed warehouses at 45\u201347 and 49\u201351 Edward Street , Brisbane City , City of Brisbane , Queensland , Australia. It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built from 1889 to 1890 by Thomas Rees . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 August 1993. History Spencers Building (left) during the 1890 flood with \"To Let\" sign The land at the site occupies part of allotments 4 and 5 of section 35 which were acquired respectively by James Donald in 1852 and the well-known Benjamin Cribb in 1854. Cribb and Donald cooperated in the subdivision and resubdivision of the allotments with the land under study passing to William Hood in 1876. Hood was a principal of the firm Hood & Binnie whose iron foundry works were located at the site until 1888. In that year title to the land passed to Frances Sophia Jones wife of the Anglican clergyman Rev Thomas Jones who had accompanied Brisbane 's first Anglican Bishop, Edward Tufnell on his arrival in 1860. It was unusual in those times for a married woman to have sole title to this kind of property, but Frances Jones probably did not have ultimate control over it. Until the Married Women's Property Act was introduced in Queensland in 1890, a husband was entitled to the income from such a property and could mortgage it without his wife's consent \u2013 unless her family had secured it to her through a trust. By May 1889 Frances Jones had mortgaged the property to a total of \u00a35000, presumably to finance the erection of the building which Thomas Rees undertook during the year; FDG Stanley, former Queensland Colonial Architect , was the designer. Rees had also built the adjacent warehouse ( South East Queensland Water Board Building ) several years earlier. The building was completed by early 1890 and in February Benjamin Brothers Ltd occupied the western section (Nos 49\u201351) \u2013 using it as a bulk store. The building was flooded in the March 1890 floods and a photo taken at the time shows a \"To Let\" sign advertising the eastern section. The leasing agent was the Queensland Trustees Executors Agency Co (QTEA), presumably acting for Frances Sophia Jones. Benjamin Brothers bulk store during the 1893 flood Two floods (1890 and 1893 Brisbane flood ), low occupancy rates and a severely depressed economy no doubt contributed to the repossession of the building in 1894. In the same year, QTEA was struck off the companies register. The vacancy rates of the 1890s were relieved somewhat around the turn of the century with the first of a series of long-term tenancies. Leonard Spencer, coach builder and ironmonger, began a twenty-odd year occupancy of Nos 45\u201347 in 1903. Another enduring tenancy, that of Roche & Dahl leather merchants (Nos 49\u201351), began in 1911. In 1913, ownership of the property was transferred to James Milne and James Raff of the machinery firm Smellie & Co, whose two business premises ( Smellie's Building and Old Mineral House ) were nearby. In the late 1920s or early 1930s, Leonard Spencer built his own building, Spencer Chambers, at 53 Edward Street and moved out of Nos 45\u201347. His place was taken by John Mitchell Hamilton, a tent manufacturer who eventually bought the entire building, with his son, in 1941. In the mid-1940s Jolly & Batchelor carried on the leather tradition at the building, buying out Roche & Dahl and moving into their premises. For many years, Jolly & Batchelor operated their business there; in 1964 they left the central city area for South Brisbane where they continue to provide materials and equipment to the leather trade and to the public. Another Spencer, a typewriter dealer, bought Nos 45\u201347 in 1978, but sold them to the present owners in 1987. The present owners of Nos 47\u201351 acquired the property in 1965. By 2014, Nos 45\u201347 had been unoccupied for several years and were sold in September 2014 (needing refurbishment). Description This Victorian warehouse has austere classical detailing in both rendered and unrendered brickwork. The building consists of four storeys and a basement level and is divided into two identical portions. The upper three floors of each portion are separated by a string course. The ground floor has tall arched openings surrounded by render that imitates rusticated stonework. Above each centre bay at the street level is a simple triangular classical pediment. The three upper levels are unrendered brick. Windows on these levels are separated by projecting brick pilasters . The windows on the two middle levels have arched heads and those on the upper level have curved pediments . Paired moulded brackets support the cornice line at the upper level. Above this the parapet has plain triangular pediments located over each central bay. The engaged brick piers at the sides and in the centre of the building continue the rusticated theme of the rendered base by having seven fielded plaster panels regularly distributed along the height of the pier on each level. Both rendered and unrendered portions of the building have been altered with the use of aluminium shopfronting at street level, moving the entry into a side bay, and a cantilevered awning . Some of the other windows have also been modified with the use of aluminium-framed glazing. The face brickwork has been painted, eliminating the original distinction between the upper three levels and the rendered street-level facade. At the rear, the face brick remains unpainted, and the two portions are distinguished by separate gable ends with central loading gantries. A modern steel fire stair serves both sections of the building.

{"id": "doc_fixed_149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_So_Bright", "text": "World So Bright is the debut album by the American musician Adam Schmitt , released in 1991. Schmitt supported the album by opening for the BoDeans on a North American tour. Production Recorded at Chicago Recording Company and in Schmitt's Champaign, Illinois , basement, the album was produced by Greg Edward and Schmitt. It contains contributions from Lisa Germano , Kenny Aronoff , John Richardson , and Jay Bennett . \"Scarlet Street\" addresses the problem of homelessness in the United States. Critical reception Trouser Press thought that the \"well-crafted songs are mega-tuneful guitar-driven gems with hooks galore and lyrics that rise above the prosaic 'boy meets girl/boy loses girl/boy misses girl/boy goes looking for another girl' fodder.\" The Chicago Tribune determined that \"the album's dozen songs resound with the innate humability that informs the best work of Squeeze, XTC and the dB's.\" The Palm Beach Post wrote: \"A hopeful romantic, [Schmitt] infuses love song after love song with memorable hooks. A tough, heartfelt delivery gives them an added edge.\" The Republican concluded that \"it's pop alright, but the hooks don't hook and the thing don't swing.\" Rolling Stone called it \"more than a promising debut, it's a confident piece of work from a canny singer-songwriter who's going to be around for a good long while.\" AllMusic wrote that \"things are less impressive when the amps get cranked too high ('River Black'), but fortunately that's not a frequent mistake, and one that's more than redeemed by songs like the wistful, touching ballad 'Elizabeth Einstein'.\" MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide deemed the album \"a flawless disc,\" writing that the title track is a \"symmetrical diamond.\" In 2001, Goldmine labeled World So Bright \"a pop manifesto to the max, brimming with catchy tunes delivered in a classic pop style.\" Track listing All tracks are written by Adam Schmitt.

Its leaves are egg-shaped to trowel-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, 10\u201355\u00a0mm (0.39\u20132.17\u00a0in) long and 3\u201325\u00a0mm (0.12\u20130.98\u00a0in) wide on a short petiole , with 3 to 7 sharply-pointed lobes. The flowers are arranged in down-turned clusters, more or less on one side of a rachis 15\u201350\u00a0mm (0.59\u20131.97\u00a0in) long, the flowers nearer the base of the rachis flowering first, each flower on a pedicel 2.5\u20133.5\u00a0mm (0.098\u20130.138\u00a0in) long. The flowers are red with a yellow-tipped style, the pistil 25\u201328\u00a0mm (0.98\u20131.10\u00a0in) long. Flowering mainly occurs from June to October, and the fruit is a glabrous , ridged, oval follicle 12\u201316\u00a0mm (0.47\u20130.63\u00a0in) long. Taxonomy Grevillea variifolia was first formally described in 1963 by Charles Austin Gardner and Alex George in the Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia from specimens collected by George in the Cape Range in 1961. The specific epithet ( variifolia ) means \"varying-leaved\". In 1998, Greg Keighery described two subspecies of G.\u00a0variifolia in the journal Nuytsia , and the names are accepted by the Australian Plant Census : Grevillea variifolia subsp. bundera Keighery has mature leaves with a petiole about 2\u00a0mm (0.079\u00a0in) long, the leaves usually triangular 11\u201315\u00a0mm (0.43\u20130.59\u00a0in) long and up to 5\u00a0mm (0.20\u00a0in) wide with up to 5 sharply-pointed lobes. Grevillea variifolia C.A.Gardner & A.S.George subsp. varifolia has mature leaves with a petiole 3\u20136\u00a0mm (0.12\u20130.24\u00a0in) long, the leaves usually lance-shaped to wedge-shaped, 17\u201343\u00a0mm (0.67\u20131.69\u00a0in) long and 15\u201322\u00a0mm (0.59\u20130.87\u00a0in) wide with up to 3 to 7 lobes that are rarely sharply pointed. Distribution and habitat Cape Range grevillea grows in open shrubland, subsp. bundera between Cape Cuvier and the Rough Range (inland from Ningaloo ), and subsp. variifolia in the northern part of North West Cape .

History Under the ancien r\u00e9gime , the consuls originally rented a room for their meetings. This arrangement continued until July 1374, when a former consul, Perrot de Verdun, bequeathed his house on the south side of Rue de l'Armillerie to the town for the purposes of establishing a municipal office, to be known as the Maison Commune. The pediment above the door was inscribed \"Romans se gouverne par ses bonnes mani\u00e8res et ses hons citoyens\" (\"Romans governs itself by its good manners and its honorable citizens\"). The building was restored in 1499, in 1562, in 1567 and in 1756. After it was no longer required for municipal use, it was sold to a private purchaser. It then served successively as a performance hall, as a private residence and then as a military barracks, before being demolished to allow the expansion of an adjacent street in 1895. Following the French Revolution , the new town council decided to acquire a more substantial building for municipal use. The building they selected, on the north side of what is now Place Jules Nadi, was the Couvent des Cordeliers ( Convent of the Cordeliers ). The convent was established by Aymar VI de Poitiers in June 1252 and was subsequently managed by the Franciscans . It was sacked by the Huguenots in 1562 and then burned down by them in 1567 during the French Wars of Religion . After the convent was confiscated by the state as biens nationaux (for the good of the state), the monks were driven out and it was acquired by the council in 1790. Although the council initially agreed to meet in part of the former convent, the building was too dilapidated for long term use and, in the late 18th century, the council decided to demolish it and to erect a new building on the same site. The new building was designed in the neoclassical style , built in ashlar stone and was completed in 1802. It was modified in the mid-19th century. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of 16 bays facing onto what is now Place Jules Nadi. It was laid out with a central section of two bays, two wings of four bays each and, beyond that, two pavilions of three bays each. The central section and the wings were three storeys high, while the pavilions were four storeys high. The central section featured two doorways with triangular pediments on the ground floor, two French doors and a balustraded balcony on the first floor, and two casement windows on the second floor. The central bay was flanked by banded pilasters supporting an open pediment with a coat of arms in the tympanum . The other bays were fenestrated by casement windows with moulded surrounds. The pavilions were flanked by banded pilasters supporting cornices and pyramid -shaped roofs. Internally, the principal room was the Salle du Conseil (council chamber). On 22 August 1944, during the Second World War , troops of the 12th Cuirassier Regiment together with elements of the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans entered the town and seized the town hall. The council chamber was refurnished with fine woodwork recovered from a former clothing store owned by Parfait Lanaz on Place Jacquemart (now Place Charles de Gaulle) in March 1954. The woodwork was restored by Vallon Faure and the seating reupholstered by Global Concept in 2021. References ^ \"La Rue de l'Armillerie \u00e0 Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re\" .

{"id": "doc_fixed_168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southie_(film)", "text": "Southie is a 1999 American crime thriller film directed by John Shea starring Donnie Wahlberg . It also stars Rose McGowan , Anne Meara , Jimmy Cummings , Lawrence Tierney , Robert Wahlberg , Will Arnett , Shea, and Amanda Peet . The film centers around Danny Quinn, a former \"street kid\" from South Boston , returning home to find his family deeper into organized crime than when he left, and his struggles not to fall back into his previous life. Plot Danny Quinn ( Donnie Wahlberg ) is a former \"street kid\" from South Boston , colloquially known as \"Southie,\" who returns home from New York City after three years away. He finds his mother ( Anne Meara ) overwhelmed with worry as her other three kids are caught up in the madness of the hardscrabble neighborhood in which drinking, sex, and fighting is the way of life. Danny tracks down his brothers only to find out they are deeply embedded in the Irish mob in Boston and in debt to local mobster Colie Powers ( Lawrence Tierney ). His younger sister Kathy ( Rose McGowan ), meanwhile, became a barfly in Danny's absence. Danny must get his hands on some quick cash in order to stop his brothers from getting their legs broken and his sister off the streets. In his pursuit to help his ailing mother and right his family's name on the streets of Southie, Danny tracks down his old girlfriend from the neighborhood, Marianne ( Amanda Peet ), finding that the love he left behind still remains. She tells how she heard about the gunfight he was in with Joey Ward ( Jimmy Cummings ) and wants to know if that is why he left town. Danny confesses that real reason he left town was that he needed to stop drinking if he were to become the man that she would want him to be. Unable to find legitimate work and banned from union jobs due to a scuffle at a wedding, Danny becomes desperate for money. Two of his old pals know Danny needs money and offer him an opportunity to be a partner in an underground gambling club, though, they neglect to tell Danny that their silent partner is his old nemesis, Joey Ward. It does not take long before Danny finds out and he and Joey are face to face. In Danny's absence from the neighborhood, Joey's father Butchie has declared war on Colie Powers and without knowing this Danny finds himself caught up in the middle of their war as it looks like he is in business with the Wards. The mob war eventually comes to Danny's front door, and the stress of an attempted murder in front of his house kills Danny's mother. Cast Donnie Wahlberg as Danny Quinn Rose McGowan as Kathy Quinn Robert Wahlberg as Davy Quinn Steven Kozlowski as Jimmy Quinn Anne Meara as Mrs. Quinn Lawrence Tierney as Colm 'Colie' Powers John Shea as Peter Binda David Fitzgerald as Francis 'Butchie' Ward Jimmy Cummings as Joey Ward Brian Goodman as Mikey 'Monk' Moriarty Lenny Clarke as Eddie 'Fat Eddie' Will Arnett as 'Whitey' Amanda Peet as Marianne Silva Janet Giannone as Peggy Silva Jere Shea as Martin Powers Katie MacIntosh as Clare Powers Josh Marchette as Will Casey Mannie Corrado as Jackie Porter Jeffery Cook as Chuckie Boyle Jay Giannone as Teddy Mac Mary Flavin as Desiree Sue Costello as Maureen 'Mo' Maloney Steve Sweeney as Paul Finnerty Production Southie was written by two young screenwriters from Boston, Jimmy Cummings and Dave McLaughlin. It was originally entitled \"Brass Ring\". The lead role was originally offered to Mark Wahlberg but he was not available following the success of the 1997 film Boogie Nights . Cummings' younger brother, Dan, suggested Donnie Wahlberg for the leading role. Shea spent a day with Ron Howard in New York as Howard completed the sound mixing on the 1996 film Ransom , in which Wahlberg had a supporting role. Shea liked what he saw and Wahlberg was offered the role. Shooting was scheduled for February 1997, in the middle of a very cold and brutal Boston winter. The film was shot with a full union crew in twenty-four days. The film ends as the real St. Patrick's Day parade goes through South Boston. The filmmakers were given permission by Thomas Menino , the Mayor of Boston , to shoot the parade. Directors of photography Allen Baker and Michael Bulter used five 35mm cameras to capture the Southie neighborhood. After almost a year of post-production editing and scoring by composer Wayne Sharp , the filmmakers changed the film's name to Southie at the suggestion of Donnie Wahlberg. It was the first feature film ever shot entirely in the old South Boston neighborhood, a place once described as \"the last white ghetto in America\". Release Southie was entered into the Seattle International Film Festival , the Nantucket Film Festival and the American Film Institute Festival in Los Angeles. The movie was acquired for distribution by Lions Gate Pictures after its screening at the Montreal World Film Festival where it was the only American film representing the United States in the main competition. In April 1999, it played at the 14th Dublin Film Festival .

Its beliefs remained similar to Seventh-day Adventists. At its peak in the 1930s the movement had 15 congregations and smaller \"missions\" throughout the United States and Jamaica .

{"id": "doc_fixed_173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urachus", "text": "Not to be confused with Vitelline duct . The urachus forms from the distal end of the allantois in the embryo , and develops into a closed cord between the base of the bladder , and the navel . It drains the bladder of the fetus that joins and runs within the umbilical cord . The fibrous remnant lies in the space of Retzius , between the transverse fascia anteriorly and the peritoneum posteriorly. At birth, the urachus develops into the median umbilical ligament . Development The part of the urogenital sinus related to the bladder and urethra absorbs the ends of the Wolffian ducts and the associated ends of the renal diverticula . This gives rise to the trigone of the bladder and part of the prostatic urethra . The remainder of this part of the urogenital sinus forms the body of the bladder and part of the prostatic urethra. The apex of the bladder stretches and is connected to the umbilicus as a narrow canal. This canal is initially open, but later closes as the urachus goes on to definitively form the median umbilical ligament . Clinical significance Failure of the inside of the urachus to be filled in leaves the urachus open. The telltale sign is leakage of urine through the umbilicus. This is often managed surgically. There are four anatomical causes: Urachal cyst : there is no longer a connection between the bladder and the umbilicus, however a fluid filled cavity with uroepithelium lining persists between these two structures. Urachal fistula : there is free communication between the bladder and umbilicus Urachal diverticulum (vesicourachal diverticulum): the bladder exhibits outpouching Urachal sinus : the pouch opens toward the umbilicus The urachus is also subject to neoplasia. Urachal adenocarcinoma is histologically similar to adenocarcinoma of the bowel. Rarely, urachus carcinomas can metastasise to other regions of the body, including pelvic bones and the lung. One urachal mass has been reported that was found to be a manifestation of IgG4-related disease .

Early life and education She was born in 1923 in a Christian family in An\u00e9ho , a town in southeastern Togo's Maritime region , the spiritual center of the Guin-Mina people . Her brother, Jean Kuassi Gbikpi, would later become archbishop of Lom\u00e9. After beginning her primary studies in An\u00e9ho, she graduated in Porto-Novo , Benin . She then attended the Cours Compl\u00e9mentaire in Lom\u00e9. Career as civil servant Sivomey was hired by the French colonial administration as a civil servant, working in the Finance Department from 1940 to 1945. She continued this Finance Department work under the framework of French West Africa from 1945 until 1953, including in the Direct Tax Department of the city of Bobo-Dioulasso , in what is now Burkina Faso . She returned permanently to Togo, which gained independence from France in 1960, and supported the leadership of the country's Direct Tax Department from 1960 to 1962. She then worked as chief administrative secretary and then director of social affairs starting in 1963. At the same time, she represented Togo at various symposiums and congresses, and in 1961 she became the first Togolese woman to participate in a session of the United Nations General Assembly . It was in this period that she also helped organize L'Union des Femmes du Togo (UFEMTO), the Union of Togolese Women, alongside Marguerite Adjoavi Thompson-Tr\u00e9nou and other women activists. Mayor of Lom\u00e9 Following the January 1967 Togolese coup d'\u00e9tat and the ascent to power of President Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma , all the country's elected bodies were dissolved, political parties were banned, and the administration of Togo's communes fell to d\u00e9l\u00e9gations sp\u00e9ciales , or special delegations. In this fraught context, Marie Mado\u00e9 Sivomey was designated mayor of Lom\u00e9 on July 24, 1967, based on her extensive experience as a civil servant. \"Among the potential candidates for the post of mayor, I was the most experienced in the workings of the administration, having previously overseen social services,\" she later said. She held the position until May 17, 1974. Later years In her retirement, Sivomey lived in Lom-Nava. She was heavily involved in her local parish, as a deeply religious woman who was at times criticized by the country's youth for her moralizing stances. She also continued to advocate on behalf of Togolese women, particularly in support of women's education. She died on September 15, 2008, in Lom\u00e9.

{"id": "doc_fixed_181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_of_matter", "text": "In United States patent law , a composition of matter is one of the four principal categories of things that may be patented. The other three are a process (also termed a method ), a machine , and an article of manufacture . In United States patent law, that same terminology has been in use since the first patent act in 1790 (with the exception that processes were formerly termed \"arts\"). The United States Supreme Court has defined \"composition of matter\" to mean \"all compositions of two or more substances and all composite articles, whether they be the results of chemical union, or of mechanical mixture, or whether they be gases, fluids, powders or solids.\" That definition is problematic, however, because composite articles can be articles of manufacture\u2014as in the case of a piece of plywood, a concrete sidewalk, a road, a fibreglass bathtub, a (kitchen) countertop, or a flitch beam . Robinson on Patents has defined \"composition of matter\" in these terms: A composition of matter is an instrument formed by the intermixture of two or more ingredients, and possessing properties which belong to none of these ingredients in their separate state. ...The intermixture of ingredients in a composition of matter may be produced by mechanical or chemical operations, and its result may be a compound substance resolvable into its constituent elements by mechanical processes, or a new substance which can be destroyed only by chemical analysis. A newly synthesized chemical compound or molecule may be patented as a composition of matter. Patents have been allowed on transitory products, such as short-lived chemical intermediates. Living things as compositions of matter In Diamond v. Chakrabarty , the United States Supreme Court held that a genetically-altered living microorganism was patent-eligible subject matter. The Chakrabarty Court said that \"we must determine whether respondent's micro-organism constitutes a 'manufacture' or 'composition of matter' within the meaning of the statute. The Court's answer to its question was yes----\"respondent's micro-organism plainly qualifies as patentable subject matter.\" But the Court never said which one it was. The oncomouse Main article: Oncomouse In 1988, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted U.S. patent 4,736,866 (filed Jun 22, 1984, issued Apr 12, 1988, expired April 12, 2005) to Harvard College claiming a mouse (the \"oncomouse\") as \u201ca transgenic non-human mammal whose germ cells and somatic cells contain a re-combinant activated oncogene sequence introduced into said mammal\u2026\u201d The European Patent Office (EPO) concluded that the usefulness of the oncomouse in furthering cancer research satisfied the likelihood of substantial medical benefit, and outweighed moral concerns about suffering caused to the animal. In the original application, the claims referred to animals in general, but in the course of the proceedings, the patent was amended and finally maintained with claims limited to mice. The oncomouse has been patented in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. After extended litigation, in 2000, a Canadian court permitted issuance of a patent on a mouse as a \"composition of matter.\" However, in 2002, the Canadian Supreme Court reversed that ruling and held (5-4) that the mouse itself could not be patented, but the biochemical process used to modify it could be.

I have represented England and the UK as an amateur, and they were the greatest times of my life, part of me wants to go to the Olympics still, but I'm positive now is the time, and I can go on to better my amateur achievements as a pro\u201d . His first fight was 3 months later when he defeated journeyman Delroy Spencer at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton . In June 2008 he fought in his home city of Birmingham for the first time beating Frenchman Alain Bonnel on points over six rounds. it was also the first time he had fought in the whole of 2008 following a string of cancelled bouts. Commonwealth Champion Despite not fighting regularly in 2008, Broadhurst still managed to win his first professional title in October. Fighting in his home town of Birmingham once more he headlined a bill that saw him win the vacant Commonwealth super flyweight crown. The opponent in the other corner was Isaac Quaye of Ghana with Broadhurst winning a unanimous decision over 12 rounds. The win meant that he had now won the Commonwealth title as an amateur and as a professional. Despite this fact the bill itself at the Aston Villa Leisure Centre will no doubt be more remembered for Broadhurst's compatriot Peter Buckley , the journeyman , winning in his 300th and last bout. Broadhurst made the first defence of his title in March 2009 at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham defeating another boxer from Ghana, Isaac Owusu in the 11th round. On 24 April Broadhurst fought his third Ghanain boxer in a row with a 6th round stoppage of Asamoah Wilson for his second title defence. Unification bout with Haskins On 11 December 2009 after 11 straight wins and two defences of his belt Broadhurst lost to reigning British super flyweight champion Lee Haskins in a unification clash. The fight, in Newport Wales, saw Haskins become a double champion after scoring a unanimous decision over 12 scrappy rounds. Speaking of his disappointment at having lost for the first time Broadhurst claimed that it was \"one bad night\" told Boxing News \"I just stayed in my bed, depressed. It was one of the worst things that has ever happened to me, it was like a family member had died or something \u2013 that is how bad it was\". Defeat to Ali Broadhurst didn't return to the ring until 18 September 2010 when he hoped that an appearance on Frank Warrens 'Magnificent Seven' event held at the LG Arena in Birmingham would re-ignite his career. It was not to be however as he lost for the second time in a row, this time to Najah Ali a fighter who had fought only five professional contests. The contest was fought at bantamweight which was above Broadhursts natural weight but the loss to Ali by two rounds was bitterly disappointing for the local man.

The club's greatest success has been to earn promotion to the tier four Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest in 2022. History Former crest of TSV Lehnerz The club was formed on 2 December 1965 as Turn- und Sportverein Lehnerz and joined competitive football a year later, in 1966. The first three decades of its history the club spent as a non-descript amateur side in local football. TSV for the first time moved up into the higher levels of Hesse football in 1997 when it won promotion to the tier five Landesliga Hessen-Nord , rebranded the Verbandsliga in 2009. Lehnerz would play the next sixteen seasons at this level, generally achieving good results and finishing in the upper half of the table. It finished runners-up in 2007 and, again in 2012 but failed to win promotion on each occasion. The 2012\u201313 season proved to be the most successful for the club, winning its Verbandsliga division and thereby direct promotion to the tier five Hessenliga . In its first season in the Hessenliga the club finished in fourth place. In 2014\u201315 the club finished runners-up in the league and thereby earned the right to take part in the promotion round to the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest . After two draws the club missed out on promotion with Bahlinger SC promoted instead. In April 2018, TSV acquired the men's first team of Borussia Fulda , which resigned from the Hessenliga, but remained as an association and continued to provide youth teams. The club was renamed SG Barockstadt Fulda-Lehnerz and received a new logo and new club colours. With the addition of the name Barockstadt , the connection to the city of Fulda has been emphasised. On 1 July, all these became official. Honours The club's honours: Verbandsliga Hessen-Nord Champions: 2013 Runners-up: 2007, 2012 Bezirksoberliga Fulda Champions: 1997 Players As of 15 September 2025 Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules ; some limited exceptions apply.

He is best known for his 1674 defense of Martinique against Dutch forces under Admiral Michiel de Ruyter , where he was captain of a warship that played a critical role in driving the Dutch land forces off their beachhead. Early years (1642\u201374) Thomas Claude Renart de Fuchsamberg was born on 21 March 1642 in Mouzon , Province of Champagne. He came from a Saxon family that had settled in Mouzon. His father was Nicolas Renart, sieur des Mahomets. His mother, born Marin, was dame d'Amblimont. His father died in the siege of Mouzon in 1653. When his older brother died in the Battle of Valenciennes (1656) he inherited the seigneury of Amblimont, near Mouzon. Amblimont obtained a position as captain in the regiment of Jean-Armand de Joyeuse, Marquis de Grandpr\u00e9 . He joined that regiment on 20 September 1656. In November 1663 Amblimont transferred to the navy as lieutenant de vaisseau . In 1669 he was capitaine de vaisseau in Rochefort, Charente-Maritime . That year he participated in the Cretan War as aide-de-camp of Almeiras. Defense of Martinique (1674) The Third Anglo-Dutch War was launched by the English and French in 1672, but the allies were outmatched by the Dutch forces under Admiral Michiel de Ruyter , who inflicted several defeats. After the English had withdrawn from their alliance with France, de Ruyter appeared off Martinique on 16 July 1674 with a fleet that included 18 warships, support vessels and 15 troop transports with 3,400 soldiers. The French were expecting de Ruyter but thought Fort Royal (now Fort-de-France ) was impregnable, so had concentrated their forces up the coast at Saint-Pierre . De Ruyter directed his force to Fort Royal, but was becalmed on the first day, giving the French time for urgent efforts to improve the defenses. Dutch assault on Fort-Royal, 1674 The governor of Martinique Antoine Andr\u00e9 de Sainte-Marthe arrived to take command at dawn, by which time the French had booms across the harbour mouth and enough men to work the batteries. Two armed ship were anchored off the fort: the 44-gun royal frigate Jeux under Amblimont and the 22-gun merchantman Saint Eustache . At the start of the attempted Invasion of Martinique de Ruyter's force was greeted by heavy gunfire when it entered the harbour in the morning on 20 July. 1,000 Dutch troops were landed at 9:00\u00a0a.m. but found themselves trapped below high cliffs, exposed to fire from the French batteries and from the two armed ships. They broke into a rum warehouse and all discipline was lost. The commanders of the Dutch land forces tried to take shelter below a cliff, but Amblimont at once landed six guns from the Jeux and opened fire on the new position. Dutch morale collapsed when their commander Van Uyttenhowe was badly wounded. The Dutch troops escaped by boat around 1:00\u00a0a.m., made a second assault at 2:00\u00a0p.m., and again were forced to retreat. The Dutch had lost 143 dead and 318 wounded against 15 French dead. They abandoned the effort, sailed north that night, and eventually returned to Europe in disarray. King Louis XIV of France ennobled Sainte-Marthe for his victory against the Dutch. The king had a medal struck to commemorate this feat of arms. Amblimont was made the first marquis d'Amblimont by letters patent. Later career (1674\u201396) Aves Barb- ados Cura\u00e7ao Grenada Guadeloupe Martinique Orchila Roques St. Christophe St. Vincent Tobago class=notpageimage| Islands in the Lesser Antilles In 1677 Amblimont cruised in the Antilles in the Alycon in the squadron of Admiral Jean II d'Estr\u00e9es and assisted in the seizure of Tobago . On 7 May 1678 d'Estr\u00e9es launched an expedition from Saint Christopher Island against the Dutch base of Cura\u00e7ao . He had 18 of the king's warships supported by more than 12 buccaneer vessels. His course was down the Lesser Antilles and then west past the Orchila , Roques and Aves islands. The fleet strayed too far south when near the Aves Archipelago and during the night of 11\u201312 May 1678 the fleet began to strike the reefs. Amblimont's D\u00e9fenseur (50) was among the warships that sank. Others were the flagship Terrible (70), Belliqueux (70), Tonnant (66), Bourbon (56), Prince and Hercule . Six other ships sank, 500 men were drowned and the French lost most of their guns. The shattered remnants of the force had to retreat towards Saint-Domingue (Haiti). In 1680 Aublimont was made a commander of the Order of Saint Lazarus . In 1683, sailing with Jean Bart on the Mod\u00e9r\u00e9 , he helped capture two Spanish vessels in the vicinity of C\u00e1diz . In 1686, still on the Mod\u00e9r\u00e9 , he was part of a small squadron under Job Forant ( fr ) and engaged in battle near Cape Finisterre . On 2 May 1687 Amblimont left La Rochelle on the 52-gun Arc-en-ciel in command of a squadron with two other warships, Perle and Profond , and two transports carrying twelve companies of marine troops to combat the Iroquois threat. The flotilla made a fast passage and reached Quebec City on 29 May 1687. In January 1688 Amblimont married Catherine Balarin de Parisot. Their son, Claude Thomas Renart de Fuschamberg d'Amblimont, also became a squadron leader. Amblimont distinguished himself at the start of the Nine Years' War (1688\u201397) in a battle where, with four frigates, he attacked five English vessels, sank two, burned a third and took a fourth. On 27 July 1689 as commander of the Profond Amblimont destroyed a Dutch squadron off the Texel . On 24 May 1692 on the Victorieux he took part in the Battle of La Hougue , for which he was promoted to squadron commander. He was promoted to chef d'escadre in January 1693. He was made a commander of the Order of Saint Louis when that order was established later in 1693. Governor general of the Antilles (1696\u20131700) Charles de Courbon de Bl\u00e9nac , governor general of the French Antilles, died on 10 June 1696 and was succeeded as interim governor general by Charles de Pechpeyrou-Comminges de Guitaut . Amblimont was appointed governor general on 1 September 1696, and was received in Martinique on 14 March 1697. He died in Martinique on 17 August 1700. Guitaut was again interim governor until Charles Desnotz took office on 23 May 1701. Notes ^ Amblimont is in the Ardennes near Mouzon. The two communes were merged into \"Mouzon commune nouvelle\" in 2015.

{"id": "doc_fixed_186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_(magazine)", "text": "Asia was an American magazine that featured reporting about Asia and its people, including the Far East , Southeast Asia , South Asia , and the Middle East . From 1934 to 1946, it was edited by Richard J. Walsh, with extensive contributions from his wife, Pearl S. Buck . Under their influence, the journal published many prominent Asian literary and political figures and American authorities. It was headquartered in Orange, Connecticut . In 1946, after many years of financial trouble, it was merged into a new journal, United Nations World . Origins and development Asia magazine was established by the American Asiatic Association in 1898 as Journal of the American Asiatic Association . An editorial in the Journal explained: \"The ignorance of our people in regard to the countries of the Far East is unquestionably a serious obstacle to the legitimate extension of American influence.\" In 1917 Willard Straight , who had been involved in promoting American trade and investment in Korea and China since the turn of the century, and his wife, Dorothy Payne Whitney Straight , bought the magazine and renamed it Asia and continued its publication as a popular journal of commerce and travel. The Straights also were co-founders of The New Republic magazine. When Willard Straight died of influenza in 1918, his widow took over publication of the magazine. She married Leonard K. Elmhirst in 1925. The editors included Louis D. Froelick and John Foord, and associate editors Gertrude Emerson and Marietta Neff. Elsie Weil , who joined the staff about 1920, was the long time managing editor. Frank H. McIntosh painted many of the covers. Under Richard Walsh and Pearl S. Buck In January 1934, although ownership remained unchanged, Richard J. Walsh, head of John Day publishers published his first issue as editor. He announced that the magazine would no longer be a tourist handbook, and despite objections from some readers, the magazine was shifted from advertising luxury goods, travel and promotion of American commerce in the Orient to discussion of international affairs and current Asian culture and literature. In the first editorial Walsh promised readers a wide range of topics and views. The magazine's political stance changed as well. Walsh wrote that it would \"look upon Communism as objectively as upon art, and bring to religious concepts as open a mind as we bring to economic problems.\" Walsh soon brought his new wife, Pearl S. Buck , into the editorial process. In the following years, Asia underwent revolution and war. Walsh, as publisher of John Day, and Buck, as America's most influential writer about Asia, attracted and recruited a new range of Asian and American writers, many of whom promoted an anti-colonial agenda, such as support for Indian independence, and anti-racist program. Subscriptions rose as Americans become more worried about the oncoming Second Sino-Japanese War . Writers included William Ernest Hocking , the Harvard liberal theologian; Hu Shih , leader of China's New Culture Movement ; Owen Lattimore , the emerging authority on Central Asia; Lin Yutang ; Jawaharlal Nehru , the Indian independence leader; and reporters such as Nathaniel Peffer ; Edgar Snow , Nym Wales , and Theodore H. White , who reported from the front line on China before World War II. Buck wrote a regular book review column titled \u201cAsia Book Shelf.\u201d The magazine recruited corresponding editors to gather articles, including Gertrude Emerson Sen in India and H.J. Timperley , an Australian journalist in China. In 1941, Walsh and Buck bought the magazine from the Elmhirsts. They changed the name to Asia and the Americas in November 1942, and Buck assumed the editorship. She continued her attacks on imperialism, particularly British, and offered strong support for colonial independence movements. With the end of the war in 1945, however, Americans lost interest in Asia and the magazine suffered a financial crisis. Buck resigned as editor in 1947 merged the magazine with Free World and Inter-American to form a new journal, United Nations World . References ^ Journal of the American Asiatic Association .

{"id": "doc_fixed_192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konevets", "text": "The pilgrims on Konevets Island Konevets ( Russian : \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0446 ; Finnish : Konevitsa or Kononsaari ) is an approximately 8.5-km\u00b2 island famous as the site of the Konevsky Monastery . It is located off the southwestern shore of Lake Ladoga near the village of Vladimirovka. The island is part of the Priozersky District of Leningrad Oblast . The nearest town is Priozersk , which is located 40\u00a0km away from the island. The island of Valaam is 60\u00a0km away and Saint Petersburg is 170\u00a0km away by boat. There is a ferry link from Vladimirovka that makes the 6.5-km trip in 40\u201350 minutes. Geography and environment Sandy beach typical of Konevets The island is 6.5\u00a0km long and generally slightly less than 2\u00a0km wide. At its widest point near the monastery on the south end of the island, where it is approximately 3\u00a0km wide. The island is completely covered in sandy soil. The majority of the shore is covered in fine sand beaches. Topographically, the island is mostly level. The terrain of sandy heath slopes gently up from the shoreline towards the interior of the island, where two cliffs, Svyataya and Zmeinaya, rise up out of the ground to 34 m and 29 m above sea level respectively. The steep cliffs are the result of erosion when the water level in Lake Ladoga was slightly less than 20 m above the current sea level, thus reaching the base of these cliffs, thousands of years before the Neva emerged. The majority of the island is uninhabited, and covered by coniferous trees. The average annual temperature is 3.5\u00a0\u00b0C. The island experiences a short summer season, from mid June to the latter half of August. July is the warmest month on the island. Winters can be quite harsh, and it is possible to walk to the island across the ice then. History See also: Konevsky Monastery Horse Stone There is no certain information about the island\u2019s earliest stages. According to sources discussing the establishment of the monastery on the island, there was a rock named Kon-kamen or Horse Rock where the Karelians went to perform sacrifices. The rock is located approximately 1\u00a0km north-northeast of the monastery at the base of the west slope of Svyataya. The rock is a rounded granite slab that is 9 m long, 6 m wide, approximately 4 m high and 750 tonnes that resembles the head of a horse. An Orthodox chapel has been built on top of it. The Russian name for the island, and thus the current Finnish name, are derived from the name of the rock or perhaps the assumed original Karelian name Hevossaari ( Horse Island ). The island\u2019s Orthodox Monastery of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary was founded by Arseny of Novgorod in 1393. The Swedes captured the island and destroyed the monastery in 1577 and 1610. Sweden lost control of the island as a result of their being beaten by Peter I of Russia in the Great Northern War . The current buildings are mainly from the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. The island did not suffer any damage in the Russian revolution , as it had become part of Independent Finland in 1917. In 1940, during the Second World War , the monks moved to the interior of Finland and joined the monks at the Orthodox Monastery of New Valamo . The island was ceded to the Soviet Union and the monastery fell into disrepair. From 1944 to 1990, the island was used by the military and thus closed to the public. In 1991, visitors were allowed back on the island and repairs and renovations to the monastery commenced. Approximately 20 monks now live on the island, which has become a popular place of pilgrimage. Trivia A traditional Karelian folk song about the island is entitled Konevitsan kirkonkellot (The Church Bells of Konevets). The Finnish group Piirpauke recorded a version of this song in 1975. Heavy metal band Sentenced used the melody as intro on their 2002 album The Cold White Light .

Her father was King Sanatruk . St. Thaddeus, St. Sandukht and other Christians in Sanatruk 's prison Life King Sanatruk of Armenia discovered that his daughter had converted to Christianity , and he pleaded with her to renounce her newfound faith and return to her native religion. However, his efforts were unsuccessful, and the angry king proceeded to imprison both his daughter, the virgin Sandoukht, and Saint Thaddeus , subjecting them to harsh tortures. The governor of the royal palace, an Armenian prince, also attempted to persuade Sandoukht to abandon Christianity, but instead, he too converted to the faith. Finally, unable to tolerate the situation any longer, the king ordered the execution of both Saint Thaddeus and his own daughter Sandoukht, who were martyred in Shavarshan, the summer residence of the Armenian royal family. According to one version of the story, at the moment when a soldier plunged his sword into the heart of the holy virgin, a pleasant scent wafted through the air, and a bright light in the shape of a fiery pillar appeared in the sky, hovering over Santoukhd's body for three days and nights. Over 2,000 individuals who witnessed this miraculous event reportedly converted to Christianity and were baptized that very night. Saint Thaddeus buried Santoukhd's body at the same location. He was executed eight days later. References ^ Geoffrey Wainwright. The Oxford History of Christian Worship . p.\u00a0152. ^ Biwzand Eghiayean (1993).

He served in the executive Council of Victoria as a minister without office from 23 January 1893 to 27 September 1894 under the Patterson Government . Early life and career Joseph Henry Abbott was born 1 February 1830 in Birmingham, England to Mary Ann Abbott (n\u00e9e Signet) and Joseph Abbott. He studied at King Edward Free Grammar School in Birmingham up until age 12 when he left to work for his father who was a millwright . At age 21 he sailed in the Earl of Derby to Melbourne upon news of the Victorian gold rush . He arrived at Cole's wharf on 17 November 1852. Once in Victoria Abbott settled in the Forest Creek area and mined for gold successfully near Moonlight Flat and Wesley Hill . In early 1853, Abbott opened a general store two friends and combined their business with mining activities. The following year they built a puddling machine to process gold-bearing clay. Around this time, Abbott, alongside Ebenezer Syme and George Edward Thomson started the newspaper the Diggers Advocate which was a strong opponent against the cost of mining permits . Abbott was a reporter for the paper based in Bendigo . The paper ran for two years. In 1858, Abbott converted a shop in Pall Mall (Bendigo) into a hotel and theatre and also was elected to the Sandhurst Borough Council becoming chairman of the council (and a justice of the peace ) in 1860. In 1862 he opened a boot shop on Pall Mall, later expanding by adding a tannery at Strathfieldsaye . Politics In the 1876 Victorian Legislative Council election contested a vacancy in the North Western Province against Alexander Fraser . Despite being elected, receiving 51% of votes, the Elections and Qualifications Committee of the Legislative Council found that Abbott was ineligible to sit as a member due to insufficient property qualifications as the property in question was in fact owned by his wife and Fraser was instead elected. In 1883, Abbott represented Victoria in the Amsterdam Exhibition and the Royal Agricultural Show in 1894. In 1888 Abbott was elected to the Bendigo council , later becoming mayor in 1891. He was elected in April 1889 to the Legislative council in the Northern Province electorate until 1904 when he lost his seat.

{"id": "doc_random_001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_Gaudin", "text": "Lucien Alphonse Paul Gaudin (27 September 1886 \u2013 23 September 1934) was a French fencer . He competed in foil and in \u00e9p\u00e9e events at the 1920, 1924 and 1928 Olympics and won a gold or silver medal in every event he entered, accumulating four gold and two silver medals total. This record is tied for the best French Olympics performance, matching fencers Christian d'Oriola (four gold and two silver) then followed by both Philippe Cattiau and Roger Ducret (three gold, four silver and one bronze). Gaudin also won two international champion's titles in \u00e9p\u00e9e (1905 and 1918), the European title in \u00e9p\u00e9e (1921, first edition) and nine consecutive French titles in foil (1906\u20131914). Some sources claim that Gaudin was on the silver-medal sabre team in 1920, crediting him with an Olympic medal in each weapon. However, the IOC medalist database does not award Gaudin a medal in that event, the full results of the event show that he did not fence, and numerous lists of competitors do not include him on the team. After retiring from competitions Gaudin became a journalist and co-owner of the company Les Films Sportifs , which produced the 1924 Olympic film. Gaudin committed suicide in 1934 when his company went bankrupt. Lucien Gaudin Cocktail There is a cocktail named after Lucien Gaudin. It has the bitterness of Campari with gin, a nod to the Negroni, but with dry vermouth rather than sweet vermouth. Then there is the addition of Cointreau. And unlike the Negroni, the Lucien Gaudin at 2:1 gin to Campari is more gin dominant. 2 ounces gin 1 ounce dry vermouth 1 ounce Campari 1 ounce Cointreau A sibling to the Lucien Gaudin is the Gloria, also gin and dry vermouth with Campari and Cointreau. 2 ounces gin 2 ounce dry vermouth \u00bd ounce Campari \u00bd ounce Cointreau With equal amounts of gin and dry vermouth, the vermouth in the Gloria becomes the dominant counterpoint to the gin. With the Lucien Gaudin you notice the Campari and Cointreau influence much more, so more of a Negroni riff. The Gloria, with the dry vermouth more dominant is more of a Martini riff.

{"id": "doc_random_002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo_Carmen", "text": "Loene Carmen (born 1970), better known by her stage name Lo Carmen , is an Australian singer-songwriter , musician, music producer, author and actress with multiple albums in the indie rock vein. She records, performs and tours solo or with long time band The Great Beyond, published memoir Lovers Dreamers Fighters and received Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress nominations for Australian films The Year My Voice Broke and Tom White . Carmen's eighth solo album, Transatlantic Light was released in September 2024 on her own label, Chiquita Records, with a limited edition vinyl pressing through Impressed Recordings. Rock critic Will Hermes described it as 'a holy-glowing dreamscape of smoke-clouded guitars, loping basslines and tantric drums that channel a history of sound recordings, from delta blues to chiaroscuro surf reveries, haunted pop ballads to modern bloodied valentines' in his liner notes. Lovers Dreamers Fighters book Lovers Dreamers Fighters was published by HarperCollins in February 2022, \"a memoir of coming-of-age on screen and in song that also pays tribute to the iconic Australian women\u2014writers, rebels, activists and fellow musicians\u2014who lit her way\". Author Madeleine Lucas said in their Rushh magazine conversation, \"At its heart, I felt like Lovers Dreamers Fighters is really a memoir about work. I appreciated that because creative work, like domestic work, is not seen as labour a lot of the time.\" Musician Paul Kelly described the book as 'a hard won account of the mess, glory and risk of making art. Lo tells her story by telling the stories of all those who've lit and tended her flame. She knows that worship is at the heart of creation. And she writes like a river.' Carmen calls it \u2018more a cultural history than a memoir \u2026 It\u2019s more a kind of love letter to all the musicians and women that have inspired me.\u2019. The book features chapters focussed on heroic police corruption whistleblower Sallie-Anne Huckstepp (who Carmen portrayed in docudrama Blue Murder , Suzi Sidewinder, who shared her final months living with AIDS in award winning documentary Suzi's Story to help combat fear and ignorance about the disease, trailblazing artists Wendy Saddington , Robyn Archer , Renee Geyer and Carmen's paternal grandmother, who was an unmarried mother and survivor of the forced adoption policy, as well as stories about pioneering performers Etta James , Patsy Cline , Loretta Lynn , Janis Joplin , Marilyn Monroe , Billie Holiday , Little Richard , Leonard Cohen and Kris Kristofferson . Early life Carmen was born in Adelaide , South Australia, and raised amongst its 1970s music and art community, which included Bon Scott and Robyn Archer. She is the daughter of rock-jazz-blues pianist Peter Head , member of prog rockers Headband and founder of bohemian country music collective The Mount Lofty Rangers, and Mouse, a textile artist and former film and television seamstress. Older brother Josh Beagley is a guitarist, most notably with funk band Swoop and country funk act Cowboy Simple. She performed her first original song publicly when aged 9, accompanied by her father. She told Sunday Life in 2022 'I spent a lot of my childhood sleeping, or reading a book, beneath his piano at gigs I insisted on accompanying him to'. The family moved to Sydney's red light district King's Cross and Carmen attended a small alternative high school, dropping out after completing Year 10. 'From the time I was 13, I was going to see bands three nights a week. I also worked after school in a pizza bar in Kings Cross. I was very independent but I wasn\u2019t wild.' Carmen also worked as secretary for Vince Lovegrove , who was then the manager of rock band The Divinyls , during school holidays and after leaving school. Carmen's mother made the wedding dress used as a costume in Muriel's Wedding as well as the iconic costumes worn by The Divinyls\u2019 lead singer Chrissy Amphlett . Carmen claims to have attended hundreds of shows by The Divinyls and soul singer Wendy Saddington, who performed in a duo with Carmen's father, Peter Head, from the 1980s until her death in 2013. Carmen cites both Amphlett and Saddington, a close family friend, as major influences. . Film Carmen was cast as the \"wild and haunted\" Freya Olson in John Duigan 's 1987 film The Year My Voice Broke after the director met her in the pizza bar where she worked, aged sixteen. Her performance, and that of her co-stars Noah Taylor and Ben Mendelsohn , was described as \"deeply memorable, central characters [that] are played by a trio of fine actors in the formative stages of their careers\". She was nominated for an Australian Film Institute Best Actress award for her role as Freya, 'arguably one of Australian cinema's most finely developed female characters, evoking the subtle shades of a burgeoning womanliness.' Mendelsohn calls it 'one of the greatest films I have made'. Other notable roles followed including Australian police corruption whistleblower Sallie-Anne Huckstepp in the docudrama Blue Murder and Christine in Alkinos Tsilimidos ' gritty drama Tom White , for which she also received nominations for Australian Film Institute Award for Best Supporting Actress, Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor \u2013 Female 2004 and IF Awards for Best Actress 2004. In 2011, director Kriv Stenders brought Carmen and Noah Taylor together again in the Australian film Red Dog , which was described in The Australian as a \"warm-hearted and thoroughly entertaining movie\". Film reviewing website Cinephelia called their pairing as husband and wife outback pub owners who are the first to find Red Dog, 'a special treat'. When asked whether she prefers film or music, Carmen explains 'making and working on music is my lifeblood and what I do every day but acting is also second nature to me. They are pretty intrinsically linked in my mind \u2013 both require commitment to getting a feeling or a character across, they just use different tools.' She also told Russh 'With film, you have no power, you just try your best to make somebody else's vision come to life. With music, I feel like I have all the power and I can just put out what I love'. Music In 1991, Carmen formed 12-piece country band, The Honky Tonk Angels, with Justine Clarke . The band also featured Noah Taylor, Terry Serio , Monica McMahon (aka Miss Monica), and musical director Peter Head. Guest performers included Robyn Archer and Tex Perkins . They performed in Sydney and Melbourne, appeared live on Tonight Live with Steve Vizard and disbanded in 1992 without recording. Garage band The White Trash Mamas, emerged out of the ashes in 1993, retaining the core axis of Carmen, Clarke and McMahon. They enjoyed a large live following, but attempts at recording, including an unreleased session with Tony Cohen , were unsuccessful and the band broke up in 1995. 'Torch rock' 8-piece band Automatic Cherry formed in 1995, with McMahon and Clarke as backing singers, who told Zan Rowe in 2018 'I've had a long musical association with Loene'. The band also featured musicians Jim Bowman (ex Ed Kuepper ), Jon Schofield (ex Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls), Cathy Green (X), Peter Head and James Cruickshank ( Cruel Sea ). They recorded one album, Slow Burner , released in 1997 to excellent critical reviews in local press, and disbanded in 1999. Carmen then formed 'slo-mo disco' duo The Charismatics with Ratcat 's Simon Day, where she played bass and sang. They released an EP titled Fateful Gaze in 1999, with an accompanying music video for the title track. Carmen also played guitar in Day's band 51 Monday, along with Nic Dalton and Alison Galloway . They released EP The Rorschach Test also in 1999. In 2000, Carmen formed Slow Hand, an 'obscure country soul covers' band. with Monica McMahon, Peter Head, John Gauci, Paul Dunn and Steve Wood. They performed extensively in Sydney and Melbourne, supported Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and recorded an album but the recordings were lost and it was never released. Carmen began focusing on a career as a solo singer-songwriter in 2001 and Slow Hand disbanded in 2002 after releasing a live album on CD only. Carmen's bedroom-recorded debut solo album Born Funky Born Free was released in 2001, with contributions from Simon Day and James Cruickshank . Reflecting on the album for Talkhouse in 2022 she said 'The album I ended up making was driven by one-string needly guitar parts played on the Ibanez \u2014 which possessed a powerful whammy bar \u2014 one-string bass riffs, tinny Casio riffs, and odd sound effects and beats from the drum machine, all fed through delays and reverbs, dub style. The album also had tinges of old school country, soul, and blues, and featured freeform lyrical journeys through imaginary worlds populated by loudspeakers, foxy ladies, horoscopes, dark bedrooms, rivers, shadows, fortune-telling machines, instincts, and destinies.' In 2004, second album, Slight Delay , described as 'a songbook of exquisitely mournful blues elements and intoxicating rock romantics...intimate shimmering confessionals' featuring Jed Kurzel and Warren Ellis was released on Reverberation Records . Rock'n'Roll Tears was released on Shock Records in 2007, co-written and recorded with Jed Kurzel and Sam Worrad. Tracks \"Nashville High\" and \"Rock n Roll Tears\" were featured in the Australian series Love My Way . It was described as an \"impeccably well orchestrated collection of moody, classic rock and roll pieces that highlights Loene's vocal strength and range\". Carmen's fourth album It Walks Like Love was released in December 2009. The album was produced with Burke Reid and recorded with musicians from teenage punk band The Scare and long time collaborator Sam Worrad from The Holy Soul on bass. Special guests include Jed Kurzel ( Mess Hall ) on duet \"Oh Apollo!\", Peter Head on piano, with Tex Perkins and daughter Holiday Sidewinder also making an appearance on backing vocals. A very limited edition CD only EP Hard Candy Christmas (2010) released under the name Sweet Carmo featured country classics by artists such as Dolly Parton , Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette . who are cited as major influences, alongside Leonard Cohen , Bob Dylan , Tom Waits and Etta James . It is no longer available online. After relocating to the US state of Georgia in 2012 while partner Aden Young shot Sundance television series Rectify , Carmen wrote and released The Peach State (2012), a suite of solo country songs, recorded in Nashville with long time Johnny Cash engineer David Ferguson . No Depression called it \"...stark country-soul and shimmering blues ...a direct line to the heart that showcases her glorious voice.\" This release also marked the professional name change from Loene Carmen to Lo Carmen. In 2013, Carmen released the album The Apple Don't Fall Far from the Tree , a collaboration with her father Peter Head . It was described as \"an album high on smoky atmosphere and the ghosts of many a raised glass\" and \"an endearing mix of country soul and late night jazz\". During the subsequent tour, the duo opened for Kinky Friedman and The Handsome Family . In 2015 she released sixth album Everyone You Ever Knew (Is Coming Back To Haunt You) that features the title track as a single. The album was self-produced and recorded in Sydney over one day by Wade Keighran with musicians Ken Gormly from The Cruel Sea, Cec Condon from The Mess Hall on drums and Sam Worrad on guitar. Global Texan Chronicles called it \"shadowy and palpable Lou Reed-esque honky tonk realism with so much rare and raw individuality that it takes you aback at first listen\", and described Carmen as \"a true storyteller\". Pan magazine described it as \"true to all of Carmen's creations, it's distinguished by her ability to summon a decade-defying sound and wind up in a world of her own making.' The album includes a song written about mysterious Blue Note jazz pianist Jutta Hipp . Aden Young filmed, directed and edited the videoclip for the single on a farm in Griffin, Georgia. First single \"Last Thing I'll Remember\" from seventh studio album Lovers Dreamers Fighters was released on 1 September 2017. Glide magazine described it as 'gorgeous twangy pedal steel, sensual vocals, haunting guitar and harmonies, and a drumbeat that conveys a quiet loneliness' A music video for second single \"Sometimes Its Hard\" (featuring Bonnie 'Prince' Billy ) was released on 26 October 2017. The video was co-directed by Get Out cinematographer Toby Oliver . Lovers Dreamers Fighters was released on 10 November 2017 to generally positive reviews. Mick Harvey recorded a version of \"Nashville High\" (co written by Carmen, Sam Worrad and Jed Kurzel) for his 2024 album Five Ways to Say Goodbye . It was singled out as an \"album highlight\" and \"the album's most luminous and upbeat song \u2013 though still filled with bittersweet yearning\". Carmen's eighth album Transatlantic Light , again recorded with Ken Gormly, Sam Worrad and Cec Condon under the banner The Great Beyond, also featured guest appearances from Robyn Hitchcock and Peter Head, and was released in September 2024. Carmen has toured and opened shows for Kevin Morby , Gareth Liddiard ( The Drones ), Kim Salmon , Eilen Jewell , Magnolia Electric Company , Mess Hall , Paul Kelly, Dirty Three , Renee Geyer and The Secret Sisters in Australia as well as Mick Harvey and Beasts of Bourbon in Europe. She showcased solo at South by Southwest in 2009 and 2016. Carmen continues to periodically perform shows and release music with her father, who often also guests on her albums. Regarded her eclectic touring style, she explained in a 2010 interview with Mess & Noise \"I prefer to have a core band that I can play with but I'm not a machine playing all the time so when I need people I just have to hope they are available. Plus, I like the idea of being like Chuck Berry, just picking up bands in every town or for different gigs. And that way the songs sound different each time too\". She records more than performing live, stating \"Making albums is the absolute joy of being a musician for me, especially the joy of recording with other people and the surprises of what they bring.\" None of Carmen's albums have charted. Personal life Carmen married actor Aden Young in Zebulon, Georgia , in 2014, after a 10-year relationship. They have two sons, Dutch (b. 2007) and Chester (b. 2011). Young directed the music videos for \"Everyone You Ever Knew (Is Coming Back To Haunt You)\", \"Nashville High\" and edited Carmen's \"Mimic the Rain\" clip.

{"id": "doc_random_004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Books", "text": "Iberian Books is a bibliographical research project set up to chart the development of printing in Spain, Portugal and the New World in the early-modern period. It offers a catalogue of what was known to have been printed, along with a survey of surviving copies and links to digital editions. It is funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation . The records created are made available in an open-access database under a Creative Commons license. Established in 2007 and based in the School of History at University College Dublin , as of December 2016 the project has made available data for the period from the beginning of printing in the Iberian Peninsula around 1472 to the middle of the seventeenth century. In late 2017, the project expects to publish the datasets for the second half of the seventeenth century. The datasets currently available online (1472-1650) hold information on 66,000 items, 339,000 copies, and 15,000 digital copies. The project works in partnership with the Digital Library Group at University College Dublin and with the Universal Short Title Catalogue Project based at the University of St Andrews . Project Iberian Books is a bibliographical resource similar to the English Short Title Catalogue , helping to identify works by a given author or publisher, or on a given subject. In addition, it helps in identifying and mapping broader publishing trends. The datasets are published via a platform that facilitates the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) harvesting of metadata in OAI-compliant Dublin Core and Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) formats. The datasets have also been incorporated in the open-access Universal Short Title Catalogue (USTC) based at the University of St Andrews . The dataset has been cited in academic monographs and journal articles, and by major auction houses. See also Books in Spain References ^ \"About Iberian Books\" . website of the project team .

Kenny's results have made him one of his sport's biggest stars; his dominance over multiple Paralympics gave rise to his nickname of 'Daz the Destroyer'. Darren Kenny OBE retired from competition in 2013. He is now the founder/owner of Estrella Career Born in Salisbury , Wiltshire , Kenny now lives in Verwood , Dorset . Having been involved in cycling since he was young, Kenny started racing at the age of eleven. In 1988, at the age of 19, an accident at the Tour of Ireland whilst descending the Wicklow Gap looked likely to have ended his career. He had damaged his neck, but did not realise the extent of the damage at the time. A series of accidents after that, notably tripping over a black cat whilst working as a milkman in Bournemouth , exacerbated his condition, as Kenny put it: \"until I was just lying on the sofa putting on weight and on heavy medication.\" At the age of 30, Kenny returned to cycling, initially to improve his fitness, but he soon began racing once more. Encouraged by a friend, Kenny contacted British Cycling to find out more about Paralympics racing. He competed at the British National Track Championships , achieving some good times, he was invited onto the Paralympic squad. In January 2008, Kenny was nominated for \"Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability\" Laureus World Sports Awards , which recognise sporting achievement during the previous year. Kenny managed to set a new world record in the preliminary round of the Individual pursuit (CP 3) at the 2008 Paralympics . The new record was 5.812 seconds faster than his own previous world record. Kenny was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours for services to disabled sport. Awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Arts by Bournemouth University in 2009 and an Honorary Degree Masters in Science by Brighton University. Awards include: Variety Club Disabled Sportsman 2004, BBC South Sports Personality of the Year 2005, BBC South West Paralympian of the Year 2008, BBC South Disabled Sports Personality of the Year 2004, Sports Journalist Award for Disabled Sportsman of the Year.

{"id": "doc_random_008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_horizon_glow", "text": "Lunar horizon glow is a phenomenon in which dust particles in the Moon's thin atmosphere create a glow during lunar sunset. The Surveyor program provided the first data and photos of the phenomenon. Astronauts in lunar orbit observed it during the Apollo 15 and Apollo 17 missions. Lunar horizon glow as observed by Surveyor 7 mission. The thin lunar atmosphere is visible on the Moon's surface at sunrise and sunset with the lunar horizon glow and lunar twilight rays, like Earth's crepuscular rays . This Apollo 17 sketch by Eugene Cernan depicts the glow and rays among the general zodiacal light . Cause Dust kicked off from the surface of the Moon will stay in the atmosphere for around 3 hours. Apart from this, electrically charged particles could be levitated by electrostatic fields with a strength of >500 V cm \u22121 . This cloud of dust, near the lunar terminator line , forward scatters the light, creating a glow near the horizon during lunar sunset. The dust, 10 micrometers in diameter, is thought to be above 10\u00a0km from the lunar surface. The levitation mechanism is thought to eject 10 7 \u00a0more particles per unit time into the cloud than those caused by micrometeoroid impacts. The term \"Moon fountain\" has been used to describe this effect. During the lunar day, infrared rays and ultraviolet rays from the Sun are strong enough to knock electrons off the dust present on lunar surface. These positively charged particles get repelled from the surface kilometers high. On the night side, the dust is negatively charged by electrons from the solar wind . Particles at the night side achieve greater electrical tension differences than the day side, launching dust particles to even higher altitudes. This dust eventually falls back to the surface, and the cycle repeats. In celestial bodies without any significant atmosphere, electrostatic transport is believed to be the leading cause of dust transport. Laboratory experiments show that dusty surfaces tend to become smooth as a result of dust mobilization. This phenomenon is thought to explain the process of dust ponds in the asteroids 433 Eros and comet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko . Strange glowing lights on the Moon are recorded from Earth for centuries. This phenomenon, known as \" transient lunar phenomena \", is now generally accepted to be visible evidence of meteoroids impacting the lunar surface. But others with an amorphous reddish or whitish glows or even as dusky hazy regions that change shape or disappear over seconds or minutes, are thought to be because of sunlight reflecting from suspended lunar dust. In 1956, this effect was anticipated by science fiction author Hal Clement in his short story \"Dust Rag\", published in Astounding Science Fiction . Exploration Coronal photographs of the Moon from Apollo 15 and 17 showed excessive brightness. The glow was also observed by astronauts in lunar orbit during sunrise for about 10 seconds. Such rays were also reported by astronauts aboard Apollo 8 and Apollo 10 . These might have been similar to crepuscular rays on Earth. The glow is also believed to appear in the star tracker data from the Clementine mission, although it would be masked by coronal and zodiacal light . The Apollo missions placed laser retroreflectors on the lunar surface. The dust is believed to be the cause of the degradation of the instruments. Apollo 17 also placed an experiment on the Moon's surface called LEAM (Lunar Ejecta and Meteorites). It looked for dust kicked up by small meteoroids hitting the Moon's surface, and recorded the speed, energy, and direction of tiny particles. LEAM saw a large increase in the number of particles every morning, coming from the east or west and slower than speeds expected for lunar ejecta. The experiment's temperature increased to near 100 degrees Celsius a few hours after each lunar sunrise, so the unit had to be turned off temporarily to prevent overheating. It is thought that this is a result of electrically charged moondust sticking to LEAM, darkening its surface so the experiment package absorbed rather than reflected sunlight. Scientists were unable to make a definite explanation of the problem, as LEAM operated only briefly before the Apollo program ended. On 20 July 2011, scientists performed experiments with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) to attempt to detect a weak signal of lunar horizon glow. The experiment was done jointly with the Lyman-Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP), Narrow Angle Camera (NAC), and Wide Angle Camera (WAC). Both of these captured pictures with long exposure times over 50 times longer than their normal exposure times. During the experiment, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter was positioned in a way that it shadowed the Sun by the Moon and was looking back across space to observe material. The NAC found a glow of 0.03 DN, and the lunar horizon was found to have a glow of 0.2 DN. A spectral radiance of 0.01 W/m 2 /sr/um was predicted to be detected by the NAC. So for the given observing geometry, the lunar horizon glow must be dimmer than 0.01 W/m 2 /sr/um.

{"id": "doc_random_012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyparissus_(Vignali)", "text": "Cyparissus is a 1620s Baroque painting on a mythological subject from Ovid 's Metamorphoses by the Italian painter Jacopo Vignali . It is on display in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg , France, to which it had been donated by the collectors Othon Kaufmann and Fran\u00e7ois Schlageter in 1994. Its inventory number is 994-1-8, or 44.994.1.8. The painting depicts the young Cyparissus , mourning his pet deer , that he had mistakenly killed with his own bow and arrow . The young boy's pain is amplified beyond the description given by Ovid, and possibly inspired by a 1624 Venetian edition of Giovanni Andrea dell' Anguillara 's Metamorfosi ridotte in ottava rima , in which the tearful aspect of the story is emphasized. It is one of the very few profane paintings by Vignali. References ^ a b c Roy, Alain (June 2017). De Giotto \u00e0 Goya.

Earlier records from Laos and Vietnam are considered misidentifications. Description Blyth's river frog is a large frog. Females grow to a snout\u2013vent length of 90\u2013260\u00a0mm (3.5\u201310.2\u00a0in) and males to 85\u2013125\u00a0mm (3.3\u20134.9\u00a0in). Large adults can weigh more than 1\u00a0kg (2.2\u00a0lb). The skin is smooth on the dorsum, with or without scattered tubercles or longitudinal skin folds. They are brownish, grey, or yellowish above and white or yellowish below. They may or may not have a vertebral stripe on their backs. Habitat These frogs inhabit streams with gravel and rocks in primary and secondary evergreen forest. Males build a nesting hollow in a sandy stream bed area, and the tadpoles develop in streams. They can also be found far away from streams. Use and conservation The major threat to this species is collection for food, both for local consumption and for trade. It is also locally impacted by habitat loss . Gallery Limnonectes blythii (subadult) - Khao Sok National Park References ^ a b c IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group.

{"id": "doc_random_018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Cimpaye", "text": "Joseph Cimpaye (1929\u00a0\u2013 c. May 1972) was a Burundian politician and writer who served as the first prime minister of Burundi for a brief term in 1961 and is considered to have written the first Burundian novel. Born into an educated family from the Hutu ethnic group , Cimpaye was considered one of Burundi's leading intellectuals in the late colonial period. He became involved in politics under Belgian colonial rule , co-founding the Union of Popular Parties ( Union des parties populaires , UPP), a cartel which was opposed by the more popular anti-colonial Union for National Progress ( Union pour le Progr\u00e8s national , UPRONA). Cimpaye briefly held the position of prime minister in 1961 before UPRONA was decisively returned in the country's first elections ahead of Burundi's independence in July 1962. Although retiring from politics, he was later arrested under the regime of Michel Micombero in 1969. While imprisoned, he wrote L'Homme de ma colline which has been acclaimed as the first Burundian novel. The work remained unpublished in his lifetime. He was among a number of influential Hutus killed in the genocidal violence of 1972 instigated by the Micombero regime. Early life Joseph Cimpaye was born in 1929 in Mugera, a small town in Gitega Province , Ruanda-Urundi . His mother was ethnically Tutsi , while Joseph was Hutu . His father, Michel Cimpaye, worked as a medical assistant for the Belgian colonial administration. Joseph completed his primary education in Rulindo District in Ruanda, where his father was posted. He went on to receive a secondary education at the Groupe Scolaire d'Astrida , where he studied veterinary science until 1952. From then until 1957 he served as an assistant veterinarian in Rutana District . He subsequently became a laboratory technician at Astrida. Political career Cimpaye became active in local politics and founded a short-lived political party called AMEHUTU in May 1960. At the time, Ruanda-Urundi was transitioning towards independence in the near future. Jean-Paul Harroy , Resident-General of Ruanda-Urundi, created the offices of national commissioners under his supervision on 21 July and named Burundians to the posts to give them a chance to practise self-government . Shortly after their creation, the number of portfolios was expanded and Cimpaye was named Commissioner of Public Works. He left his laboratory position to assume the office. In March 1961 Cimpaye co-founded the Union of Popular Parties ( Union des parties populaires , UPP), a cartel to stand against the more popular Union for National Progress ( Union pour le Progr\u00e8s national , UPRONA) under Prince Louis Rwagasore . The UPP fractured into three tendencies, and Cimpaye and Emmanuel Nigane led one of these groups in trying to reach an understanding with UPRONA. On 26 January 1961 the Belgian Governor-General of Ruanda-Urundi signed an ordinance creating an interim government in Urundi. The colonial administration selected Cimpaye to lead the government as Prime Minister of Urundi . In response to UN General Assembly resolution 1605, on 6 July the government was modified and enlarged to grant more representation to different political parties. Cimpaye served until September 1961. UPRONA won the country's first elections decisively that month and Rwagasore replaced Cimpaye as prime minister. Later life Cimpaye left politics after UPRONA's victory and took up a career in journalism and public relations . Between October 1962 and November 1963 attended training seminars at the Institut Belge d'Information et de Documentation in Brussels and at the Centre universitaire d'enseignement du journalisme of the University of Strasbourg designed for African journalists. He later returned to Bujumbura and was hired by the Belgian airline Sabena on 2 January 1964 as a public relations specialist. He was later made head of sales for the Bujumubura office. In 1965 he married a Rwandan Tutsi businesswoman. He was distrusted by Michel Micombero who came to power at the head of a radical Tutsi regime after a series of coups d'\u00e9tat in 1965\u201366. Cimpaye was arrested by the regime on 6 October 1969 for alleged involvement in a Hutu coup plot. In February 1970 he was sentenced to five years in prison. During his incarceration, he authored a French-language novel entitled L'homme de ma colline ( lit. \u2009 ' The Man From My Hill ' , or ' District ') which followed the struggles of a protagonist named Benedikto living in a rural part of Burundi during the colonial era in the 1930s or 1940s. It addressed the theme of exile and was praised by Jean\u2010Marie Ngendahayo for its use of language, particular Kirundi proverbs in translation. Cimpaye was released from prison in a general amnesty on 1 July 1971. He was among a number of Hutu elites killed during the Ikiza by Micombero's regime in May 1972. Works Cimpaye, Joseph (2013).

{"id": "doc_random_020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coelho_Neto", "text": "This article is about the Brazilian writer. For the municipality, see Coelho Neto, Maranh\u00e3o . For the Rio de Janeiro neighbourhood, see Coelho Neto, Rio de Janeiro . For the subway station in that neighbourhood, see Coelho Neto Station . Henrique Maximiano Coelho Neto (February 20, 1864 \u2013 November 28, 1934) was a Brazilian writer and politician. He founded and occupied the second chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters , from 1897 until his death in 1934. He was also the president of the aforementioned Academy in 1926. Life Coelho Neto was born in the city of Caxias , Maranh\u00e3o , on February 20, 1864. His father was Portuguese , and his mother was an indigenous woman, Ana Silvestre Coelho. At six years of age, his parents moved to Rio de Janeiro . He began his education at the Externato of the Col\u00e9gio Pedro II . He attempted medical school but soon gave up. In 1883 he enrolled at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo School of Law , living in the boarding house where also lived Raul Pompeia, who attended the Academy of S\u00e3o Paulo at that time. He soon found himself involved in a student movement against a professor. In anticipation of reprisals, he moved to the Law Faculty of Recife , where he completed the first year of law, having been a student of the jurist and poet Tobias Barreto. Returning to S\u00e3o Paulo, he devoted himself passionately to the abolitionist and Republican campaign, an attitude that led to new frictions with the University of S\u00e3o Paulo School of Law. In 1885 he finally abandoned his legal studies and moved to Rio de Janeiro. He became part of a group of bohemians that included figures such as Olavo Bilac , Lu\u00eds Murat , Guimar\u00e3es Passos and Francisco de Paula Ney . The history of this generation appears later in his novels A Conquista and Fogo F\u00e1tuo , dedicated to his friend Francisco de Paula Ney, a brilliant orator and journalist known for his bohemian life style and his famous anecdotes. He joined the newspaper Gazeta da Tarde , later moving to the sheet Cidade do Rio , where he held the position of secretary. From this period date his first published volumes. He was also a practitioner of the Afro-Brazilian martial art of capoeira . On August 6, 1888, a speech by Quintino Bocaiuva was attacked by hitmen led by an infamous street capoeirista named Benjamim, but Neto, who was in attendance, disarmed and submitted him. In 1890, he married Maria Gabriela Brand\u00e3o, daughter of educator Alberto Olympio Brand\u00e3o. They had 14 children. One of those was the famous football player Jo\u00e3o Coelho Neto (known as \"Preguinho\"). He was appointed to the post of secretary of the government of the state of Rio de Janeiro and the following year, director of State Affairs. In 1892 he was appointed professor of art history at the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes (National School of Fine Arts) and, later, professor of literature at the Col\u00e9gio Pedro II. Author of numerous books, articles, stories and serials, he was appointed professor of history of theater and dramatic literature at the Escola de Arte Dram\u00e1tica (Drama School) in 1910, and soon after director of the same institution. He was elected congressman for Maranh\u00e3o in 1909 and was reelected in 1917. He was also secretary-general of the League of National Defense and a member of the Advisory Board of the Municipal Theater of Rio de Janeiro . In addition to holding public office, Coelho Neto maintained and intensified his activities in magazines and newspapers of all sizes, in Rio and other cities. In addition to signing works with his own name, he wrote under numerous pseudonyms, including Anselmo Ribas, Caliban, Ariel, Amador Santelmo, Blanco Canabarro, Charles Rouget, Democ, N. Puck, Tartarin, Fur-Fur and Man\u00e9s. In 1923, he converted to Spiritism , delivering a speech about his adoption of the spiritual doctrine in the Sal\u00e3o da Velha Guarda (Hall of the Old Guard) in Rio de Janeiro. He was active in virtually all literary genres and was for many years the most widely read writer in Brazil. He wrote what could have been the first Brazilian serial movie, The Mysteries of Rio de Janeiro . However, only the first episode was ever completed. He was probably the most widely read Brazilian writer in the first decades of the twentieth century. However, he and his work were attacked by the Modernists during the Modern Art Week (or Semana de Arte Moderna, in Portuguese) in 1922 and this probably contributed to his later neglect by publishers and the Brazilian public.

{"id": "doc_random_023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Oedekerk", "text": "Steven Brent Oedekerk (born November 27, 1961 ) is an American filmmaker, actor and stand-up comedian . He is best known for his collaborations with actor and comedian Jim Carrey and director Tom Shadyac (particularly the Ace Ventura franchise), his series of \" Thumbmation \" shorts and his film Kung Pow! Enter the Fist (2002), along with his films Santa vs. the Snowman 3D , Barnyard , and The Nutty Professor remake. For his film Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius , Oedekerk was nominated for an Academy Award . Early life Oedekerk was born in Seattle, Washington ; he was raised by his mother Rena Borlandeli and father Martin Oedekerk in Huntington Beach, California . He attended Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, California and Golden West College in Huntington Beach. He is of Dutch Frisian, Irish, Hungarian, and Italian ( Lombard ) descent. His mother is an immigrant from Magnago , Italy. His paternal grandfather was an Afrikaner born in South Africa to Dutch parents. Career Throughout his career, Oedekerk has appeared in and created several television specials for NBC , ABC , and UPN . He also contributed his writing talents to FOX during the late 1980s and through the early 1990s. It was during this time that Oedekerk befriended fellow comic/actor Jim Carrey while working on the television series In Living Color during its 1990\u20131994 run; this was the first of numerous collaborations between the two. Prior to his successful contributions to several unknown episodes in the Color TV series, he wrote and starred in his first independent/directorial film, Smart Alex (1987). It wasn't until 1991 that Oedekerk was attached not only as a writer, but also as the protagonist, as Thane Furrows in the film High Strung . Jim Carrey also starred opposite him in the role of Death , although he went uncredited. They eventually developed a strong friendship, which still exists today. Shortly afterward, Oedekerk again worked alongside Carrey as the project consultant for Tom Shadyac 's first film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994). The film became a break-out success and he was given the opportunity to both direct and write its sequel, Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995). This time Oedekerk directed and wrote the movie after Shadyac left before filming. The sequel proved to be more successful, surpassing the box office gross of the original. Despite this, both Oedekerk and Carrey wanted to pursue other projects, but still remained friends. Following the Ace Ventura franchise, Oedekerk co-wrote The Nutty Professor (1996), which was also directed by Shadyac for Universal Pictures ; it became one of the highest-grossing films of that year. He soon wrote, directed and also had a cameo appearance in Nothing to Lose (1997), starring Tim Robbins and Martin Lawrence . Oedekerk took a hiatus from directing major film productions for the rest of the 1990s, but continued to write screenplays, including Patch Adams (1998), Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (2000), Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius (2001), Kung Pow! Enter the Fist (2002) (which he directed, wrote and starred in ), Bruce Almighty (2003) and Barnyard (2006) (which he directed, wrote, produced, and voiced various characters). In 2003, he signed a first look deal with Universal. In 2007, Oedekerk produced the screenplay and story for the Bruce Almighty sequel, Evan Almighty ; again, Shadyac directed both films. He has also been commissioned to write the screenplay for the Ripley's Believe It or Not! film adaptation; Jim Carrey has since been cast in the title role. No news involving the project has been reported since. In February 2009, Universal Pictures announced that Steve Oedekerk would be penning a film adaptation of the Stretch Armstrong superhero doll. As of 2016, the film is left in development hell with an animated series currently in the works. In 2015, it was announced that a sequel to Kung Pow is currently in the works with him returning to write and direct. O Entertainment O Entertainment was a production company founded by Steve Oedekerk in 1990. O Entertainment's productions include the Thumbmation series ( Thumb Wars , Bat Thumb , Thumbtanic , etc.), Santa vs. the Snowman 3D , Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius , The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius , Back at the Barnyard , and Planet Sheen . The animation division, Omation Animation Studio, was founded by Oedekerk himself and hired animators who previously worked in DNA Productions after the studio closed down in 2006. In 1997, Oedekerk created and starred in a variety special, featuring computer animation, entitled The O Show (also known as steve.oedekerk.com ). He is also executive producer of the animated series The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius on Nickelodeon . Omation Animation Studio Oedekerk founded Omation Animation Studio (commonly known as Omation ) in 2002 as a division of O Entertainment. Their first animation project was the feature film Barnyard (which Oedekerk wrote, directed, produced, and performed as a voice actor). Around 2006\u20132007, the studio began production on a Nicktoon based on the film titled Back at the Barnyard . The series premiered on Nickelodeon on September 29, 2007. A second season followed, and six additional episodes airing on Nickelodeon's sister channel Nicktoons from September 12, 2011, until November 12, 2011.

{"id": "doc_random_024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_State_Route_35", "text": "State Route\u00a035 ( SR\u00a035 ) is a 68.291-mile-long (109.904\u00a0km) state highway in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Alabama . The southern terminus of the highway is at its intersection with SR\u00a09 in rural Cherokee County northeast of Cedar Bluff and near the Georgia state line. The northern terminus of the highway is at Woodville in Jackson County where it has a second intersection with U.S. Route\u00a072 (US\u00a072). Route description North of its southern terminus, SR\u00a035 begins an ascent over Lookout Mountain as a two-lane road. The highway heads in a northwesterly direction as it travels through the Little River Canyon National Preserve along the county line dividing Cherokee County and DeKalb County leading into Fort Payne . As the highway descends Lookout Mountain, within the Fort Payne city limits , it makes a 90-degree right turn at the foot of the mountain. Numerous trucks descending this route have suffered brake failure and wrecked at this turn as a result, causing numerous fatalities. One resident living at this turn, Joe Faulkner, erected a reinforced concrete wall to protect his property. The wall assumed the popular name, \"Joe's Truck Stop.\" Comer Bridge (1930) carrying the southbound lanes of SR\u00a035 over the Tennessee River at Scottsboro From Fort Payne, SR\u00a035 is routed along a four-lane divided highway as it heads towards Rainsville . The highway is a four-lane highway from its intersection with US\u00a011 in Fort Payne to its intersection with US\u00a072 in Scottsboro , except for a brief stretch from near its intersection with SR\u00a071 in Section , to the foot of Sand Mountain and the east bank of the Tennessee River , where it intersects SR\u00a040 . The Alabama Department of Transportation plans to eventually four-lane this remaining section of the Fort Payne\u2013Scottsboro route. The highway crosses the Tennessee River over the Comer Bridge (southbound) and the Bob Jones Bridge (northbound). A new bridge is under construction to replace the Comer Bridge, and was expected to open in 2012, but finally opened May 2016. In the early 1990s, a section of the highway was rerouted from a dogleg extending from Fort Payne through Pine Ridge to Rainsville along the natural slope of Sand Mountain, to the current four-lane route. The current route reaches the brow of Sand Mountain along a ramp through a manmade gap in the side of the mountain. Until 1980, the northern terminus of SR\u00a035 was at Scottsboro, where it intersected US\u00a072. It was extended westward along the former alignment of US\u00a072 after the U.S. Highway was relocated to a new four-lane highway between Scottsboro and Huntsville . Although SR\u00a035 travels in a south by southwestward trajectory as it leaves Scottsboro, it is signed as \u201cSR\u00a035 north\u201d until its terminus at a second intersection with US\u00a072 at Woodville in western Jackson County .

Senate of Nigeria Ibrahim Mohammed Bomai was elected on the nineteenth of February 2019 as the senator representing Yobe South Senatorial District . On 25 February 2023, he was reelected as a senator to serve in the 10th Senate. However, the election was declared inconclusive, and a supplementary poll on 15 April 2023, took place, during which he was declared the winner and was returned as elected. Constituency Project controversy While on a standard review of constituency projects in September 2021, the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission found that issues with Bomai's projects. First, a borehole supposed to have been dug in the Sabongari area of Nangere LGA was never dug while other boreholes were dug in the wrong communities or with substandard generators. The other project that the ICPC inspection team flagged was a missing generator that had been stolen from the college it was given to. The inspection team leader ordered the contractor to fix the borehole issues and said the commission would work for the return of the stolen generator. However, Senator Ibrahim Mohammed Bomai later clarified that the borehole projects were awarded by the Federal Ministry of Works, not facilitated by him, and that any issues were the responsibility of the contractor. He also stated that the transformer supplied to CAMTECH Potiskum was duly delivered, and that subsequent adjustments were matters between the institution and the Yobe State Rural Electrification Board.

A Passion ) is a 2000 Indian Telugu-language drama film , written and directed by film-critic K. N. T. Sastry in his debut directorial, based on a story by Rentala Nageswara Rao. The film features H. G. Dattatreya , Brahmaji , Tanikella Bharani , and Jaya Seal in pivotal roles. Upon release, the film received positive reviews and won the Best First Film of a Director award at the 49th National Film Awards . The citation praised the film \"for its juxtaposition of two diverse ideologies existing within the same family\u2014the father's belief in his religion and traditions and his son's revolutionary ideology. The film strikes a very fine balance in inter-generational explorations.\" Thiladaanam is the only Indian film to be honoured with the New Currents Award at the 7th Busan International Film Festival . It was also featured in the Indian Panorama section at the 33rd International Film Festival of India , and in a Retrospective at the New York Indian Film Festival . Plot Subbayya is an outcast Brahmin priest living in Hyderabad, who survives by performing tiladaanam (a Hindu ritual of giving sesame seeds as alms, which transfers the giver's sins to the receiver), the meanest form of Brahmin duty. He ekes out a living as a corpse-carrier, moving from funeral to funeral, studying and practicing the tradition of washing away the sins of the deceased. He is a staunch follower of traditional values and is content with his social position. In contrast, his son, Raghuram, is a Naxalite and is willing to resort to violence to bring about societal change. This ideological conflict creates tension between father and son, with greater dangers looming ahead for the family. Raghuram makes a clandestine visit home during the birth of his child, but in search of him, the anti-Naxalite team ransacks Subbayya's house. Although Raghuram escapes the police firing, killing a cop in the process, he eventually surrenders to the authorities, hoping that his family will receive government compensation. Shocked by his son's surrender, Subbayya dies from the trauma, leaving his daughter-in-law, Padma, waiting in vain for the promised compensation. Cast H. G.

{"id": "doc_random_029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_D._Sayers", "text": "Joseph Draper Sayers (September 23, 1841 \u2013 May 15, 1929) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 22nd governor of Texas from 1899 to 1903. A conservative Democrat , he served as the 12th lieutenant governor of Texas from 1879 to 1881 and in the Texas Senate from 1873 to 1874. Early years Joseph Sayers was born September 23, 1841, in Grenada, Mississippi , to David Sayers and his wife Mary Thomas ( n\u00e9e Peete). His mother died in Charleston, Mississippi , in 1847, and soon after he moved to Texas with his father and younger brother, William. The family settled in Bastrop , where Sayers and his brother attended the Bastrop Military Institute. Civil War When the Civil War broke out, Sayers joined the Confederate States Army 's 5th Texas Regiment, a cavalry unit led by General Tom Green . He participated in the Battle of Valverde in New Mexico in February 1862, and was recommended for promotion for his bravery in capturing an artillery battery. Later that year he returned to Texas with his regiment before being sent to Louisiana , where he was wounded in the Battle of Fort Bisland in April 1863. His actions during that conflict led to his promotion to major, and he became Green's chief\u2013of\u2013staff. Sayers was wounded again in April 1864 at the Battle of Mansfield . After Green died at the Battle of Blair's Landing , Sayers became the assistant adjutant to General Richard Taylor . Lawyer After the war ended, Sayers returned to Texas. He opened a school and simultaneously studied law. He was admitted to the bar and then formed a partnership with G. \"Wash\" Jones . Personal life Orline Walton In 1868, Sayers married Ada Walton. She died in 1871, less than three years after the wedding. In 1879, Sayers married Ada's younger sister, Orline Walton, an amateur painter. Orline Walton was a native of Aberdeen, Mississippi. During her childhood, her father moved with his family to Bastrop, Texas. She was married to Joseph D. Sayers when he was Lieutenant Governor, and the first years of her married life were spent in Austin. She was a member of the Methodist church and interested in its educational work. Public service Sayers entered political service in 1873, when he became a state senator in the 13th Texas Legislature . In his term, he helped reverse most of the legislation that had been passed under the Radical Republicans . After his term ended in 1875, Sayers spent three years as chairman of the Texas State Democratic Executive Committee. He presided over the state Democratic convention in both 1876 and 1878. At the 1878 convention he was nominated to be lieutenant governor under Oran M. Roberts and later won the election. Sayers and Roberts differed on one key point; Sayers believed that public lands should be saved for homesteaders and schools, not sold cheaply to speculators, as Roberts advocated. Congress Sayers was first elected to the 49th Congress as a representative of Texas's 10th congressional district in 1884. In his first election, he received 9,270 votes over his competitor, John B. Rector , who ran as an Independent . He was re-elected in 1886, 1888, 1890, 1892, 1894, and 1896. In 1888, in the election to the 51st Congress , Sayers won against the Republican nominee for the district, the popular civic leader Augustus Belknap of San Antonio . He served in Congress until 1898, when he ran for governor. Campaign for governor Lafayette L. Foster was the Chairman of the Sayers Central Campaign Committee. In the summer of 1898, Foster was appointed as the President of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas by the Board of Directors of the college. He was succeeded as chairman by Edward M. House . Sayers was supported by House in his campaign against Martin McNulty Crane in the Democratic party primary. Sayers won the gubernatorial election against Barnett Gibbs , the Populist party candidate, and took office in early 1899. Governor During his term in office, labor unions were exempted from antitrust laws, and blacklists were outlawed. His term saw increased spending on education, prisons, and social service institutions and outlawed railroad rebates. He also spearheaded legislation that authorized the creation of school districts. Sayers's term was notable for the number of disasters that the state faced. The Brazos River flooded in 1899, and the following year the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 caused great devastation. Other parts of the state suffered from a severe drought, and boll weevils caused widespread cotton destruction. Millions of dollars in assistance came to the state, and Sayers administered the distribution of the funds \"honestly and fairly.\" He was the last Confederate soldier to hold the office. Later years After leaving office in 1903, Sayers focused mainly on his law practice. He also took the time, however, to serve on the Board of Regents for the University of Texas System as well as on the Industrial Accident Board, the State Board of Legal Advisors, and the pardon board. Death and burial Sayers died in Austin on May 15, 1929, and is buried in Bastrop's Fairview Cemetery . Notes ^ The History of Texas By Robert A.

He introduced ideas of \"the forest as a plant society\", which he developed into the definition of the forest as a complex biogeocenotic, geographic and historical phenomenon that was made up of non-living and living components. Life Morozov was born in St. Petersburg , Russia , where his father worked in a linen drapery. He went to the military academy at Pavlovsk and graduated in 1886 as a second lieutenant . When posted in Latvia , he met several students including the exiled revolutionary Olga Zandrok. After her period of exile had ended, he left the army, moved back to St. Petersburg with Olga and began to study the agricultural sciences at the Institute of Forestry. Morozov's father disowned him, and he was left to earn his own living by teaching while he studied. He studied botany under I.P. Borodin and was influenced by the soil scientist P.A. Kostichev , the zoologist N.A. Kholodkovsky and at the Zandrok household by the anatomist and family friend Peter Lesgaft . Lesgaft had been dismissed from St. Petersburg University for his political views but gave private lessons in anatomy, and Morozov attended them. That gave him a firm founding in evolution and comparative anatomy. Morozov graduated in 1893 and was grief-stricken when Olga Zandrok died from diphtheria . He later married Olga's sister Lidia Nikolaevna. Morozov worked as a forester in the Khrenovk forest preserve in Voronezh gubernia . In 1896, he was sent to study forest management in Germany and Switzerland and spent time at the Eberswalde Academy with Professor Adam Friedrich Schwappach . On his return, he was posted to the Voronezh province to examine afforestation measures. The forest had been planned by the soil scientist Vasily Dokuchaev to manage droughts. There, Morozovexamined the growth of pine and wrote his first work. In 1899, he wrote a work on forests and soils after he had examined Dokuchaev's works. Morozov worked with Dokuchaev and G. I. Tanfilyev . In 1901, Morozov was posted as professor of forestry in St. Petersburg. Morozov introduced the term \"silvics\" and considered the forest to be a connected and complex system, rather than a mere collection of trees. He examined the development of forests, plant succession and harvesting practices. He was also involved in higher education. In 1917, he suffered poor health and moved to Yalta . In 1918, he took up a position at the new university in Simferopol , where he died about two years later. References ^ Egerton, Frank N.

The first-generation LaCrosse replaced the Century and Regal in North America beginning for model year 2005 as a five- or six-passenger, four-door, front-wheel-drive, V6-powered sedan using GM's mid-size W platform \u2014and marketed in Canada as the Buick Allure . Notably, the first generation was also offered with a V8 engine, as a high-performance sub-model marketed as the LaCrosse Super (2008\u20132009). LaCrosse production and marketing began for China with model year 2006. The second-generation LaCrosse was introduced for 2010 as a larger premium sedan for North American and Chinese markets using a long-wheelbase (LWB) variant of the Epsilon II platform shared with the Cadillac XTS \u2014and available solely as a five-passenger sedan with a range of four- and six-cylinder engines. The third generation was introduced for North America and China for model year 2017 using the GM Epsilon platform shared with the Chevrolet Impala , notably offering a mild hybrid powertrain combining 20-kilowatt (27\u00a0hp) electric and 2.5-liter Ecotec gasoline engine. North American production ended with the third generation, with model year 2019; however, it continued to be offered in China, with a 2019 facelift. The fourth-generation LaCrosse, launched in 2023, is currently manufactured and marketed solely in China. It is powered by a turbocharged 1.5-liter or 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. Background and name In 2000, Buick showcased a LaCrosse concept featuring styling features that referred to Buicks of the late 1940s including a descending swage line (featured on Buicks starting in 1940 and sporadically until the 1970s) and front fender port holes. Unique features included a removable rear roof and trunk panel (converting the trunk into a truck bed) and voice recognition instead of traditional switches for basic interior functions. The Buick LaCrosse concept was based on the GM G body shared with the Buick Park Avenue. As the Buick nameplate, the term lacrosse refers to the sport . Out of caution, GM chose to market the model in Canada as the Allure because the words \" faire la crosse (make the cross) \" are a slang Qu\u00e9becoise phrase meaning \"to masturbate\"\u2014even though the words la crosse themselves translate as \"the cross\" in French and are not generally problematic. First generation (2005) North America The first generation LaCrosse debuted in late 2004 as a 2005 model, replacing the Century and Regal\u2014solely as a four-door, front-drive sedan. The nameplate was borrowed from the 2000 Buick concept of the same name. Using the MS2000 variant of GM's long-lived front-drive W-body platform, the LaCrosse was initially available with two powerplants and three trim levels: a 3.8\u00a0L 3800 Series III V6 available in CX and mid-level CXL, and a 3.6\u00a0L HFV6 V6 in the CXS model. The CXS was replaced by the LaCrosse Super sub-model in North American markets, with the CXS available partly through model year 2008. Sales of the CXS continued in Canada until January 1, 2008. Structurally, the engine cradle, previously steel, was replaced by a stiffer, stronger, and lighter extruded aluminum cradle, weighing 20 pounds less. The LaCrosse used more high-strength steel than its predecessors, as well as a magnesium cross-car beam behind the instrument panel, another cross-car beam behind the rear seats, steel reinforcements in the rocker panels, interlocking door latch system, high-strength steel door beams, and a double-thick Quiet Steel floor pan and firewalls. CX and CXL models used the 4T65-E automatic transmission and Super models used the 4T65-E HD variant. The LaCrosse, along with all other GM vehicles powered by the 3.8\u00a0L V6, became the first SULEV -compliant vehicles for 2006. All models were manufactured at GM Oshawa Assembly . Front driver and passenger airbags were standard, with optional side curtain airbags \u2014 which became standard for model year 2006. All LaCrosse models featured an acoustic package, marketed by Buick as QuietTuning , to reduce, block, and absorb cabin noise. Features of the system included acoustical windshield and front side laminated glass; steel laminate on the front-of-dash body area; expanded baffles in the roof pillars; melt-on sound deadeners throughout the entire lower body structure; and sound-absorbing material throughout the engine, passenger, and cargo compartments. Buick offered the LaCrosse as a five-passenger sedan, using front bucket seats and a console-mounted shifter, the console integrating with the upper instrument panel. At extra cost, a six-passenger configuration was available where the front seats shared a center flexible console that could fold up for a sixth passenger or fold out to provide a storage console, the transmission using a column-mounted shifter. Regarding its styling, noted automotive journalist Warren Brown described the Lacrosse as a \"delightful rendition of the automobile as functional art.\" The final first-generation LaCrosse was manufactured on December 23, 2008. North American sales reached roughly 290,000 for model years 2005\u20132009, and the 2009 model was the last GM car using the company's noted and long-lived 3800 V6 engine. 2008 facelift 2008\u20132009 Buick LaCrosse The LaCrosse received a facelift for 2008 with the vehicle's revised front design based on the Buick Velite concept and later used by the first generation Chinese LaCrosse. All trim levels received a chrome exterior appearance package, factory remote start feature, XM Satellite Radio, telescoping steering wheel column, redundant steering wheel and climate control as added standard equipment (audio only post-MY 2006). CX included a leather-wrapped steering wheel, theft-deterrent system, illuminated vanity mirrors, driver information center personalization, and hydraulic struts supporting both the engine hood and trunk lid. For the 2009 model year, the last of the first generation, heated outside rearview mirrors became standard on all models; a 60/40 split folding rear seat added to Driver Confidence Package; navigation became available via OnStar; Bluetooth became available on all models with includes integrated steering wheel controls; 16-inch painted aluminum wheel were standard on CX models and 17-inch chrome-clad wheels became available on CX models. LaCrosse Super (2008\u20132009) 2009 Buick LaCrosse Super To coincide its introduction with the first generation's MY 2008 facelift, Buick previewed the LaCrosse Super in March, 2006 in New York and again at the Buick Open in Grand Blanc, Michigan, in July 2006, presenting it formally at the 2007 New York International Auto Show \u2014as a higher-content, higher-performance, and more exclusive LaCrosse sub-model. Resurrecting the Super nameplate from Buick's 1930s\u20131950s model , the model featured minor interior and exterior tweaks as well as a 5.3-liter, 300-hp V8 engine shared with the Pontiac Grand Prix GXP and Chevrolet Impala SS , and Monte Carlo SS \u2014engineered under the direction of former Corvette engineer John Heinricy with the GM Performance Division . Noting that the Super would share parts with Chevrolet and Pontiac variants, Heinricy said the LaCrosse aimed to balance performance and refinement for a smoother, quieter and more grown-up demeanor. The Super's LS4 5.3\u00a0L V8 engine made 300\u00a0hp (224\u00a0kW) and 323\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (438\u00a0N\u22c5m), used premium fuel, and featured variable displacement technology (marketed as Active Fuel Management ), capable of deactivating four of its eight cylinders to save fuel. It was noted for its factory top speed of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) and a 0\u201360\u00a0mph time of 5.7 seconds. The Super used the heavier duty 4T65-E HD four-speed automatic transmission, magnetically sensitive variable-effort power steering (marketed as Magnasteer ), and a steering rack with closer-fitting gear teeth, tighter bushings, and a stiffer torsion rod controlling the variable-effort power assist. Chassis tuning featured Bilstein mono-tube struts; larger rotors at all four disc brakes; full-range, powertrain- and brake-modulated traction control ; revised suspension tuning with standard electronic stability control , marketed as Stabilitrak ; dual exhaust with two 3.5-inch chrome tips; and 18-inch cast aluminum wheels with P235/50R18 all-season tires. The exterior featured Buick's hallmark fender-mounted VentiPorts ; a revised front fascia incorporating the larger and more pronounced 2008 upper grille (recalling Buick's Velite concept), lower grille chrome trim with chrome bezels for projector beam fog lights, revised side rocker moldings, a very small deck-mounted rear spoiler, and a revised rear fascia with integrated parking sensors . Exterior color choices were brown, black, red, and silver\u2014marketed as Mocha Brown Metallic , Black Onyx , Red Jewel Tincoat , and Platinum Metallic . Interior features included a blue-faced instrument cluster with Super badging, dark faux chestnut wood trim, enhanced front seatback bolstering, split fold-down rear seats, redundant steering wheel\u2013mounted radio and cruise controls, leather seating surfaces with inserts embossed to mimic woven leather (marketed as Dream Weave ), heated front seats, remote start, premium sound system with nine speakers (marketed as Concert III ), OnStar, and optional Bluetooth wireless technology. Upholstery colors were Platinum (light beige) and Mocha Brown (dark brown). The 2008 base price for the LaCrosse Super was $32,820 (equivalent to $49,770 in 2024), which rose to $33,805 for 2009. Assembled alongside other LaCrosse models at GM's Oshawa Car Assembly Plant 2, sales reached 2,277 for 2008 and 139 for 2009. Safety The LaCrosse received a Good overall score in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety 's frontal impact crash test and a Marginal overall rating in the side impact test. Injury measurements for the side-impact crash test include a Poor mark for the driver's torso and a Marginal score for the driver's pelvis and leg. Side airbags are limited to the curtain type for both front and rear rows; the torso-type side airbag is unavailable. 2007 models also earned one out of five stars in a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration side-impact crash test. The IIHS also found that the 2006\u201308 model year LaCrosse had the second-highest fatality rate in the large four-door car class; only the Buick Lucerne fared worse. Models China Shanghai GM introduced the Buick LaCrosse ( Chinese : \u522b\u514b\u541b\u8d8a ) in February 2006, as a more upscale companion to its Buick Regal sedan. Designed by Shanghai GM's Pan Asia Technical Automotive Center ( PATAC ), the Chinese LaCrosse is based on the same architecture as the North American model, with different exterior sheetmetal, interior design and available engines. The car is also manufactured in Taiwan by a joint Yulon \u2013GM venture. 2006\u20132008 Buick LaCrosse front (China) 2006\u20132008 Buick LaCrosse rear (China) Eco-Hybrid In 2008, Shanghai GM introduced a mild hybrid system on the LaCrosse. Using the Belt Alternator Starter system, it is the first hybrid vehicle in the Chinese market as well as the first hybrid in its segment. 2008 Buick LaCrosse Hybrid front (China) 2008 Buick LaCrosse Hybrid rear (China) Second generation (2010) Launched at the 2009 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, the second-generation Buick LaCrosse was completely redesigned, becoming Buick's flagship sedan. The exterior used faux vents and a falling swage line , marketed respectively as VentiPorts and Sweepspears \u2014and making reference to styling elements Buick had incorporated in various forms since introducing them in 1949. The second-generation used a long-wheelbase (LWB) variant of the Epsilon II platform, shared with the Opel Insignia , 2010\u20132012 Saab 9-5 , and the Cadillac XTS . The design was based on 2008 Buick Invicta concept, and replaces both the Chinese and North American models. The final design work was carried out at the GM design center in Warren, Michigan. The LaCrosse was marketed in Mexico starting in 2010, as the Buick brand returned to the country after 13 years.

Rear view (pre-facelift) Engines The 2.4L Ecotec four-cylinder replaced the 3.0L V6 as the standard engine on the CX model in the first quarter of 2010. The 3.6L V6 continues to be an option on the CX and front-wheel-drive CXL and standard on the CXS and all-wheel-drive CXL. All V6 models are equipped with the Hydra-Matic 6T70 6-speed automatic transmission. Reception The New York Times said the new LaCrosse combined design elements from classic American cars of the 1930s and 1950s with traditional Chinese aesthetic elements: U.S. News & World Report aggregated the following ratings based on numerous reviews of the models years, also for the 2016 model year. Results of the analysis were given on a scale of 1 to 10, where a higher number indicates positive reception. The overall result for the 2016 model year was 8.7, critics' rating 8.8, performance 8.1, interior 8.4, and safety 9.7. Technology and features The 2010 Buick LaCrosse CXS was the first North American car to incorporate a front suspension design, marketed as HiPer Strut , designed to improve ride and handling while reducing torque steer . The Buick LaCrosse CXS included a system marketed as Real Time Damping that adjusts the damping forces of the shocks and struts for improved ride and handling. The 2010, 2012, and 2013 models lacked an interior trunk release mechanism. The trunk was only accessible using the key fob (remote keyless entry) or a touch sensor between the trunk lid and the license plate. The 2011 model added a remote release button at the left of the steering wheel on the instrument panel. The 2014 model refresh returned the trunk release button to LaCrosse but placed it on the driver door. eAssist The 2012 LaCrosse features a new mild hybrid as its base model. Dubbed eAssist , the 2012 LaCrosse introduced GM's second-generation belted-alternator starter system. The non-hybrid 4-cylinder was no longer offered. The system consists of a 115-volt lithium-ion battery pack, a 15\u00a0 kW electric motor capable of adding 15 horsepower of assist while accelerating, and the next-generation 6T40 GM Hydra-Matic transmission with reduced friction components over the previous generation. The eAssist LaCrosse delivers a class leading fuel economy of 25 mpg city and 36 mpg highway. In addition to providing additional power to the 182\u00a0hp 2.4L 4-cylinder, the BAS-II system allows for engine start/stop operation when the vehicle is not moving and allows for complete fuel cutoff to the engine during deceleration. Canadian market: Allure The second-generation LaCrosse debuted to the Canadian market at the 2009 Montreal International Auto Show as the Buick Allure, and soon after production began, General Motors Canada renamed the Allure to LaCrosse, to correspond with the car's global marketing. GM Canada has offered existing Allure owners the option to change nameplates to LaCrosse. Korean market: Alpheon The Alpheon was a localized version of the Buick LaCrosse for the South Korean market. Alpheon was a standalone brand from GM Korea . The cars were additionally fitted with amenities such as controls in the rear armrest, mood lights and more. A version of the vehicle (with 3.0L V6 engine mated to a six-speed automatic transmission) was unveiled at the 2010 Busan International Motor Show. Production began on August 9, 2010, at GM Daewoo's factory in Bupyeong , Incheon. Market launch began in September 2010. Early models included one with a 3.0-liter engine (from the 2010 Buick LaCrosse) in mid-September, followed by two models each with a 2.4-liter engine in October. The Alpheon was discontinued in 2015, after monthly sales fell below 500 cars. GM Korea replaced it with the Chevrolet Impala . 2010 Alpheon sedan 2010 Alpheon sedan interior Chinese market: Roewe 950 Main article: Roewe 950 The Roewe 950 was a licensed restyled Chinese version of the Buick LaCrosse produced by Roewe of SAIC . It was sold alongside the Buick LaCrosse in China, and had a price range similar to that of the LaCrosse. The sheet metal, while similar in appearance, was unique to the Roewe. In late February 2012, the Chinese government removed the Buick LaCrosse (along with all other foreign vehicles) from the list of vehicles approved for government procurement. Though popular among government officials, the LaCrosse also thrived via private purchases. 2014 facelift Buick LaCrosse front (2014 facelift) Buick LaCrosse rear (2014 facelift) Buick unveiled a revised 2014 LaCrosse at the 2013 New York Auto Show . Redesigned front and rear fascias, new wheel designs, a reconfigurable eight-inch TFT LCD instrument cluster, semi-aniline leather seating, and radar- and camera-based safety features such as forward collision alert and side blind zone alert are among the most notable changes for this mid-cycle refresh . For 2016, the LaCrosse added a new Sport Touring Edition which included unique 18\" aluminum black pocket wheels, and a rear lip spoiler. Production Production of North American models moved from Oshawa to the Fairfax Assembly plant in Kansas City, Kansas , where it ran down the same production line as the Chevrolet Malibu . Delivery of 2010 models was delayed a few weeks in order to assure quality control. Production for China started a month later. Safety The 2010 model year LaCrosse was awarded \"Top Safety Pick\" by IIHS, as it received a Good rating in the crash test evaluations particularly in the roof strength test which it could withstand force of four times its vehicle weight. Third generation (2017) The third-generation LaCrosse debuted at the 2015 LA Auto Show as a 2017 model using the E2XX platform shared with the 2016\u20132020 Chevrolet Impala . The platform switch and use of high-strength steels reduced weight by about 300 pounds (140\u00a0kg), despite slightly growing in length and width. The car was powered by a GM Small Gasoline Engine and GM Ecotec engine in China for tax credit purposes and by a fourth-generation GM High Feature engine in North America. Since 2018, the LaCrosse came standard with an eAssist drivetrain, consisting of a mild hybrid 20-kilowatt (27\u00a0hp) electric and 2.5-liter Ecotec gasoline engine sending power to the front wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission. In order to make room for an upcoming new product in the Kansas City facility, the production of the LaCrosse was moved from GM Fairfax Assembly to Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly . The main difference between the North American and Chinese model LaCrosse was the drive system. Models sold in the Chinese market were front-wheel drive vehicles only, compared to their American counterparts which were available in front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Rear view Third-generation features included: Automatic parking assist (front ultrasonic parking assist is now present). Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for the Buick IntelliLink infotainment system. An all-new 3.6-liter direct-injection VVT V6 engine ( LGX 310\u00a0hp / 282\u00a0lb-ft), with stop-start and cylinder deactivation. Externally-sourced 8-speed Aisin ( AWF8F35 ) automatic transmission (2017 only). Starting in 2018, an all-new 9-speed GM 9T60 (M3G) automatic transmission with the optional V6. Safety The 2017 LaCrosse received a Top Safety Pick in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety 's Crashworthiness test and a Poor rating for headlights, which prevented a Top Safety Pick Plus . The LaCrosse came standard with ten airbags: front air bags, roof rail\u2013mounted head-curtain air bags, seat-mounted side-impact air bags for both front and rear outboard seat passengers, and knee air bags for front seat passengers. Additional standard safety features included ultrasonic rear parking sensors and a backup camera. Optional safety features included a following distance indicator, forward collision alert, forward collision braking, front pedestrian detection, blind spot detection, lane keeping assist, and rear-cross traffic alert. Reception Car and Driver's said the LaCrosse had an \"elegant exterior, much-improved interior materials, impressive ride and handling with up level suspension,\" while U.S. News & World Report listed the 2017 LaCrosse as a Finalist for Best Large Car for Families. Motor Trend said \"the car drops about 300 pounds and rides on a new platform, which contributes to a better driving experience and a much quieter ride. Buick also separates the LaCrosse from most competitors by offering all-wheel drive on the highest trim level,\" and listed the Kia Cadenza , Nissan Maxima , Chrysler 300 , and Lexus ES as competitors. Consumer Reports was critical of the gear selector, saying \"our biggest gripe about the controls is the new electronic gear selector. Drivers used to a traditional PRNDL configuration\u2014in other words, those drivers who kept the lights on for Buick for many years\u2014will be puzzled, if not angered.\" In addition, reviewers were critical of the sticker price on top-trim, heavily optioned models with Bloomberg saying \"by the time you spend the $48,395 it costs to get the LaCrosse to this level, you're creeping into Audi/BMW/Mercedes territory.\" Discontinuation The Buick LaCrosse was one of six vehicles GM discontinued after the 2019 model year amid a global restructuring effort. The discontinuation of the LaCrosse affected the North American market and Buick will continue to manufacture the LaCrosse in China, where the sedan remains a best seller. Production of the Buick LaCrosse for North America ceased on February 15, 2019. 2019 facelift 2019 Buick LaCrosse facelift (China) A facelift was introduced for the 2019 model year in the Chinese market, with the facelifted LaCrosse featuring a new 2.0-liter turbo engine to the powertrain options. The new 2.0-liter turbo engine is one of GM's eighth-generation Ecotec engines and delivers a maximum output of 237\u00a0hp and 350 N-m (258\u00a0lb-ft) of torque. The 2019 LaCrosse was available with a nine-speed Hydra-Matic automatic transmission with an average fuel consumption of 6.9 liters per 100 kilometers (34 miles per gallon). Trim levels for the New LaCrosse model are known as the 652T Elite, 652T Luxury and 652T Distinguished. From 2021 to 2023, the 552T trim level was available where a 1.5 liter turbocharged engine was also introduced as standard. Fourth generation (2023) In 2023, Buick unveiled the fourth-generation LaCrosse, adopting Buick's new Pure Design philosophy first seen on the Buick Century minivan, as well as Buick's new corporate emblem. The fourth-generation LaCrosse is available in four trims: Beyond, Enjoy, Premium, and Avenir. The LaCrosse was only offered with a turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine at launch; a 1.5-liter four-cylinder for the base model will be available later in 2023. This generation Lacrosse is the first of its kind to have the gear selector in the style of a column shifter compared to previous generations which used the floor shifter based gear selector.

Early life Elaine Guthrie was born in Tremont , Maine, to Walter Edward Guthrie and Eliza Pray Guthrie. After attending Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard , and serving in World War I, Walter founded the family printing company in Boston. Eliza, called Lida, was a classical singer. Guthrie attended the New England Conservatory of Music , and in 1943 she joined the Red Cross where she taught piano and painting to orphans in Naples , Italy. In Naples she met Louis Livingston Lorillard (1919\u20131986), a United States Army lieutenant. While serving in Naples, Guthrie and Lorillard shared an interest in listening to jazz, which they had experienced in New York City. Newport Jazz Festival In 1953, Guthrie and Lorillard visited the Storyville nightclub in Boston with her brother, Thomas T. Guthrie, and his friend, Professor Borne from Boston University . They met George Wein , who founded and managed the nightclub, and they discussed the possibility of bringing an outdoor jazz concert to Newport, Rhode Island , where they lived. With the guidance of John Hammond and George Avakian , two record producers and executives at Columbia Records , they came up with a list of performers. With a $20,000 grant from the Lorillards, the first Newport Jazz Festival took place in July 1954, attracting 11,000 fans. The Lorillards supported the festival until 1961. The Lorillards said that the festival was founded as a nonprofit organization. Biopic The movie High Society (1956), with a storyline by family friend Cleveland Amory , adapted The Philadelphia Story (film) as a musical set in Newport during the jazz festival. Grace Kelly was rumored to have been cast for her resemblance to Elaine Lorillard. The movie was filmed in Newport with scenes from the Lorillards' life, from a convertible passing their house, \"Quatrel\" on Bellevue Avenue, to their daughter sitting at their piano with Louis Armstrong . Personal life In 1946, she married Louis Livingston Lorillard (1919\u20131986). Louis was a descendant of Robert Livingston , first Lord of Livingston Manor , and Pierre Lorillard , who founded the P. Lorillard Company in 1760. Before their 1962 divorce, they had two children: Edith Pray Lorillard, who married military historian Robert Cowley , son of writer Malcolm Cowley , in 1978. Pierre Livingston Lorillard Lorillard died in the Heatherwood Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Newport, where she had been treated for pneumonia/ MRSA at the age of 93.

{"id": "doc_random_033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archambault_A27", "text": "The Archambault A27 is a French sailboat that was designed by Joubert Nivelt Design as a racer and first built in 2012. Production The design was built by Archambault Boats in Dang\u00e9-Saint-Romain , France , starting in 2012, but it is now out of production as the company ceased business in 2015. Design The Archambault A27 is a racing keelboat , built predominantly of fibreglass . The hull is a single skin, vacuum-infused polyester fibreglass, while the deck is a PVC polyester, vacuum-infused sandwich. It has a fractional sloop rig with aluminum spars, a retractable bowsprit , a deck-stepped mast and two sets of swept spreaders. The hull has a plumb stem ; an open, plumb transom ; an internally mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a tiller with an extension and a fixed fin keel , twin keels or a hydraulically operated swing keel with dual rudders. It displaces 4,750\u00a0lb (2,155\u00a0kg) and carries 1,764\u00a0lb (800\u00a0kg) of cast iron ballast. The single fin keel-equipped version of the boat has a draft of 5.67\u00a0ft (1.73\u00a0m), the twin keel version has a draft of 3.83\u00a0ft (1.17\u00a0m), while the swing keel-equipped version has a draft of 6.92\u00a0ft (2.11\u00a0m) with the keel extended and 3.08\u00a0ft (0.94\u00a0m) with it retracted, allowing operation in shallow water. The boat is fitted with either an inboard diesel engine of 12\u00a0hp (9\u00a0kW) with a sail drive , or a small outboard motor for docking and manoeuvring. The fuel tank holds 7.9 U.S. gallons (30\u00a0L; 6.6\u00a0imp\u00a0gal) and a 13 U.S. gallons (49\u00a0L; 11\u00a0imp\u00a0gal) freshwater tank is optional. The design has sleeping accommodation for four people, with a double \"V\"-berth in the bow cabin and two straight settees in the main cabin, along with a centre table. The galley is located on both sides just aft the bow cabin. The galley is equipped with an optional gimbaled stove and a single sink. The head is a chemical type and is located under the bow \"V\"-berth. Ventilation is provided by a foredeck hatch. For sailing downwind the design may be equipped with a symmetrical spinnaker or an asymmetrical spinnaker of 786\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (73.0\u00a0m 2 ). The mainsheet traveller is set into the deck, just aft of the tiller. It has a hull speed of 6.70\u00a0kn (12.41\u00a0km/h), but will also plane . Operational history In a 2012 Yacht magazine review Michael Good wrote, \"a bowsprit and aggressive lines betray the sporty genes of this Joubert-Nivelt design that promises high performance potential. The interior arrangement, which is relatively comfortable for a boat of this size, with four bunks, an open forward cabin, and a standard porta-potti, turns the A27 into a weekender or even a modest cruising boat, with the optional comfort package that includes additional lockers, settees with backrests, a saloon table, a stove, and a 50-liter water tank.\" Adam Cort of Sail magazine wrote a review in 2014, saying, \"with its blunt ends, retractable sprit, wide-open racing cockpit and hiking wings, is very much the kind of a boat that stands out in a crowd. But what really impressed me about this little sportster (aside from its performance) were the accommodations.\" Sail magazine named the boat one of its Best Boats 2014 , in the Performance Monohull (30ft and under) class, saying, \"this athletic-looking racer features a plumb bow with a slightly upturned knuckle just above the waterline, a hard chine, hiking wings, and a planing-friendly undercarriage than transitions into beamy, equally planing-friendly stern sections.\" See also List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats Catalina 275 Sport References ^ a b c d e f McArthur, Bruce (2020). \"A27 (Archambault) sailboat\" . sailboatdata.com .

The club played its first friendly match on 22 January 2022, beating Conn Rangers, a non-League team from neighbouring County Mayo , 6\u20133 at the \"Sean Fallon Centre\" all weather pitch at The Showgrounds before a crowd of about 300 people. On the opening day of the 2022 Women's National League, 5 March 2022, Sligo Rovers lost their first competitive match 6\u20130 at Peamount United . The FAI later awarded Sligo Rovers a 3\u20130 walkover win, when Peamount reported themselves for fielding an ineligible player in the match. Seven days later the first home match at The Showgrounds was lost 3\u20130 to DLR Waves before an encouraging crowd of 945. On 19 March 2022 the club secured its first ever competitive win, 2\u20131 over Cork City at Turners Cross . Gemma McGuinness scored the club's first official goal in the match. The club got to two consecutive FAI Cup semi-finals under Steve Feeney in 2023 and Tommy Hewitt in 2024 they lost both games to Athlone Town with both games taking place at The Showgrounds . Hewitt's time at the club was short and unsuccessful after joining the club after Feeney stepped down only getting a total of 5 points out of the nine they got that season he stepped down before the two last games with Sligo getting their only win after he stepped down. Steve Feeney came back to the club for the 2025 after previously managing them for the 2022 and 2023 season Players Current squad As of 30 January 2026 Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules ; some limited exceptions apply.

{"id": "doc_random_039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Justice_(East_Germany)", "text": "The Ministry of Justice of the German Democratic Republic ( German : Justizministerium der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik ) was established in 1949 in East Germany and dissolved in 1990. Its duties were subsequently taken up by the federal Ministry of Justice of the united Germany, and the justice ministries of the six new federal states. The Ministry was housed at 93 Dorothea Street (Dorotheenstra\u00dfe 93), the former offices of the Weimar and Nazi Interior Ministry. It published the journal Neue Justiz . History After the Second World War and the collapse of Nazism in May 1945, Germany was divided into four zones of occupation , with the area that would become East Germany occupied by the Soviet Union . It was governed by the Soviet Military Administration in Germany , ( German : Sowjetische Milit\u00e4radministration in Deutschland (SMA)). On 17 July 1945, the SMAD issued Order No. 17, which established a judicial system in the Soviet occupation zone. The German Central Administration for Justice (German: Deutsche Zentralverwaltung f\u00fcr Justiz (DJV)) was subsequently founded in November 1945, with the SMAD appointing Eugen Schiffer as their first DJV president, though he was dismissed and replaced in 1948 with Max Fechner . In 1949, with the founding of the German Democratic Republic as a nominally independent state, the DJV was transformed into the Ministry of Justice. Max Fechner was appointed the first Minister of Justice. By this time, the judiciary had already been brought into line with communist policy. Though mentioned in the Constitution of East Germany , there was no guarantee of judicial independence . The use of Volksrichter ( English People's Judges) also helped to bring the courts closer to the SED . In 1953, the L\u00e4nder of the Eastern Zone were abolished, and their Justice Ministries became part of the central ministry. After speaking critically of the prosecution of strikers in the protests of June 1953 in an interview with Neues Deutschland , Fechner was removed from office, denounced as an \"enemy of the state and the party\" and spent three years in prison and Stasi internment. He was replaced by Hilde Benjamin , who had presided over the show trials of the 1950s. In 1963, the power of the ministry was weakened by a decree which transferred responsibility for control of the courts to the Supreme Court of East Germany , which reported directly to the State Council . After the fall of the Berlin wall , the Ministry of Justice oversaw the transfer of its powers back to the states and the drafting of the Unification treaty under the supervision of Kurt W\u00fcnsche.

{"id": "doc_random_040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Valley_Quipus", "text": "The Santa Valley Quipus are a group of six quipus (also spelled khipus )\u2014Andean knotted cord recordkeeping devices\u2014found in Peru\u2019s Santa River Valley. These quipus have drawn scholarly attention due to their possible correlation with a 1670 Spanish colonial census document from San Pedro de Corongo , as well as their stylistic similarity to earlier Inca quipus. Some researchers have dubbed them the \"Rosetta quipus\", likening them to the Rosetta Stone for their potential role in deciphering Andean knotted records. Description The six quipus were reportedly found together in a single tomb in the Santa Valley, though their precise provenance is unknown. They were acquired and first studied by Carlos Radicati di Primeglio in the mid-20th century. Today, they are housed in the Biblioteca Museo Temple Radicati in Lima. Each quipu features consistent cord color patterning known as color-banding , a feature sometimes used to designate these as \u201cbanded khipus\u201d. Each color band consists of six pendant cords, resulting in 804 total cords organized into 133 six-cord groups. Their shared structure and origin suggest the six form a unified archival set. Proposed link to the 1670 revisita The potential link between the quipus and a 1670 Spanish colonial revisita (revisit or census) was first proposed in 2011. The revisita lists 132 named tributaries divided among six pachacas ( lineage groups roughly equivalent to ayllus ) which closely mirrors the 133 color-banded six-cord groups in the quipus . Each differently colored group may represent one individual tributary. The total tribute amounts described in the census also appear to correspond with the summed knot values of the first cord in each six cord group on the quipus . Moiety structure and cord attachments A 2018 study suggested that the recto and verso orientations of pendant cord attachments may encode moiety affiliation for each tributary and proposed a moiety alignment for the six lineage groups listed in the revisita . In 2024, further analysis identified a stronger alignment, proposing that verso attachments represent the upper ( hanan ) moiety and recto attachments the lower ( hurin ) moiety. Furthermore, the study noted that the order of the six lineage groups noted in the census also appears to follow a bipartite and tripartite hierarchical structure consistent with known Andean social models.

{"id": "doc_random_041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Zant_(duo)", "text": "Van Zant is an American musical duo composed of brothers Donnie Van Zant and Johnny Van Zant . Both are brothers of Ronnie Van Zant , the original lead singer for the Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd . Johnny became the lead vocalist for the reunited Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1987. Donnie was the leader and vocalist of .38 Special . Initially a Southern rock band, Van Zant first recorded in the 1980s on Network /Geffen Records before disbanding. Johnny and Donnie re-established Van Zant in 1998 to record two albums for CMC International, switching their focus to country music in 2005, with two more albums on Columbia Records as a duo. The duo's first Columbia album, Get Right with the Man , produced a top ten country hit in \" Help Somebody \". History Johnny recorded as a member of the 1980s southern rock band The Johnny Van Zant Band which released albums in 1980, 1981 and 1982. The band shortened its name to Van Zant for the release of its fourth album in 1985, the eponymous Van Zant on Network /Geffen Records . This album saw chart success with \"You've Got to Believe in Love\" and \"I'm a Fighter\" (written by Jimi Jamison and Mandy Meyer from Cobra ), both of which peaked on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. However, this band did not include Donnie and was soon disbanded. Johnny released another album under his full name in 1990, but spent most of his time in that period singing for the Lynyrd Skynyrd reunion group. He joined up with Donnie, and they revived the Van Zant name to release an album in 1998, Brother to Brother Initially intended as a one-off project, Brother to Brother saw chart success in the single \"Rage\", so the duo followed it up in 2001 with Van Zant II for the label. This album included their fourth charting rock single in \"Get What You Got Comin ' \". Country music career In 2005, the duo crossed over into country music, releasing Get Right with the Man on Columbia Records . The album produced a Top 10 country single in \" Help Somebody \", followed by the No. 16 \" Nobody Gonna Tell Me What to Do \" and No. 59 \"Things I Miss the Most\". The album also earned RIAA gold certification. The Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal in 2005 began with an investigation of an installation of the CD Get Right with the Man . It was not possible to import the CD into iTunes because of a glitch created by Sony's digital rights management software. The glitch was eventually fixed when the second Sony uninstaller offered allowed for the software to be removed. iTunes can import the CD now, even from the original copy-protected version of the disc. Van Zant released a second album for Columbia, My Kind of Country , in 2007. This album included the singles \"That Scares Me\" and \"Goes Down Easy\", both of which failed to reach Top 40 on the country charts. After the release of the latter, the duo exited Columbia. Donnie had been forced to retire from his work with 38 Special due to health problems in 2013. In 2019, Johnny stated in an interview that he and Donnie had continued to work on new music and were planning on releasing some of the work after Lynyrd Skynyrd disbanded.

{"id": "doc_random_043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonia_comma", "text": "Polygonia comma , the eastern comma , is a North American butterfly in the family Nymphalidae , subfamily Nymphalinae . Description Upperside of wings This butterfly is seasonally variable. The upperside of the summer form's hindwings are all black, whereas the winter forms hindwings are reddish orange. The underside of both forms is striped with dark and light brown. There is a silvery comma mark in the middle of the hindwing in both forms. Its wingspan is 4.5\u20136.4\u00a0cm (1.8\u20132.5\u00a0in). Habitat The eastern comma may be spotted in woods near rivers, ponds, marshes, swamps, and other water sources. Nectar plants This butterfly seldom visits flowers, but rather feeds on sap, rotting fruit, salts and minerals from puddling , and dung. Host plants Caterpillars feed on paper birch ( Betula papyrifera ), false nettle ( Boehmeria cylindrica ), hackberry ( Celtis occidentalis ), hops ( Humulus ), wood nettle ( Laportea canadensis ), currants and gooseberries ( Ribes spp.), basswood ( Tilia americana ), American elm ( Ulmus americana ), nettle ( Urtica ), and clearweed ( Pilea pumila ). Life cycle The green eggs are laid singly or in stacks under host plant leaves and stems. The spiny larva varies in color from pale green to yellow to white and to even black. The solitary larva feeds on leaves at night. Older larvae construct daytime leaf shelters by pulling a single leaf together with silk. The chrysalis is brown and covered with spines. Winter-form adults overwinter; some will also migrate south for the winter. Similar species The dark form of comma is frequently confused with the dark form of the question mark ( P. interrogationis ), but the two can readily be distinguished by the shape of the comma mark on the underside. The pale form is easily confused with the satyr comma ( P. satyrus ), which usually occurs north and west of the eastern comma's range. They can be distinguished by the upperside color, which is orange brown in the comma and tawny yellowish brown in P. satyrus ; by the underside pattern, which tends to be mottled in the comma but appears to be more longitudinally streaked in P. satyrus ; and by the row of pale submarginal spots on the hindwing upperside, which tend to be separate and surrounded by dark shading in comma, but are larger and tend to run together into a pale band in P. satyrus .

{"id": "doc_random_045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Artley", "text": "George Robert Artley (July 1, 1917 \u2013 October 21, 2011) was a professional illustrator, commercial artist, cartoonist, and writer. He was probably best known for his editorial cartoons which ran in the Des Moines Tribune , the Worthington, MN Daily Globe , and the Rochester, MN -based AgriNews and for his feature panel \" Memories of a Former Kid \" , many of which still appear in publication. Artley also wrote or illustrated many books, most of which recount his memories of growing up on his parents' Northern Iowa farm during the first half of the 20th century. Early life Artley, the first born of George Denison Artley and Elsie Louise (Crow) Artley, was born on the family farm (established by his grandfather in 1877) five miles west of Hampton and three miles east of Latimer, Iowa . Artley attended grade school at a country school within a two-mile walking distance of his parents\u2019 farm and after passing his eighth grade exams, went on to Hampton High School where he graduated in 1935. While growing up, Artley took an interest in drawing and art, an interest which was nurtured by friends and family. During High School, Artley started focusing on editorial cartooning, partly at the behest of Miss Dunn, Artley's English teacher, and was featured at the high school and in local stores and publications. This exposure led to his being mentored by Artley's idol, the Des Moines Tribune's J.N. \"Ding\" Darling , who critiqued his work, supplied him with drawing supplies, and suggested he start drawing from life about subjects close to him \u2013 thus Artley's lifelong stock in trade of drawing scenes from the farm. Although he drew all aspects of the farm, many of his first live subjects were pigs since their pen was most available. Many of his earliest sketches can be seen in his 2003 book Living With Pigs . His love for drawing was matched with his love for farm life: \"I like everything about a farm,\" he said in a 2003 interview with the Worthington Globe Gazette . \u201cThere was a downside, of course, like everything else. It was hard work \u2013 discouraging at times \u2013 but you\u2019re outside. I liked the outside. I liked the animals. I just liked the whole farm atmosphere.\u201d After high school, he attended Grinnell College while helping his father on the farm. In the fall of 1941, just before starting what would be his senior year at Grinnell, Artley volunteered for the U.S. Army. After first being assigned to the Army Corps of Engineers , he was later transferred to the Medical Corps where he was a Medic and then a Laboratory Technician drawing slides. Although his wartime service was all stateside, he was being trained to be part of the U.S. force for the Operation Downfall invasion of the Japanese Homelands when the atomic bombs ended the war. While in the Army in 1943, he met and married fellow lab technician and Women's Army Auxiliary Corps enlistee Virginia E. (Ginny) Moore, of South Fork, PA while they were both stationed at Fort Leonard Wood in central Missouri. Artley returned to civilian life in 1946 where he continued farming with his father. In 1950, he returned to college on the G.I. Bill of Rights , attending the University of Iowa , and completed his Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1951. Drawing career While at the University of Iowa, he drew editorial cartoons for the school's paper, the Daily Iowan , and his work caught the attention of the Des Moines Tribune . He was hired by the newspaper and worked there from 1952 to 1957. Artley went on to work for Nelson Advertising Agency for a year and then was art director for Plain Talk Publishing (both in Des Moines) for nine years. During these years, he was active in the area arts communities as a member of the Des Moines Art Center , through teaching art classes, conducting numerous \"chalk talks\" at various schools and civic functions, and mentoring local aspiring artists. In 1967, the Artley's moved to Adrian, MN where the couple published the small town newspaper, The Nobles County Review . Shortly after, they purchased a building in Adrian and began a commercial printing company, The Print Shop. In 1971, he began doing some commercial and cartoon work for the Worthington Daily Globe , which eventually led to exclusive cartoon work and his editorial cartoons were routinely among the best in the country. During his time at The Globe , he started a periodic and popular cartoon of life on the farm during his childhood called, \"Memories of a Former Kid.\" This led in 1978 to Artley self-publishing the book by the same name. Due to its popularity, Artley couldn't keep up with the demand and sold the rights to Iowa State University Press. On June 8, 1982, the day the \u201cMemories of a Former Kid\u201d cartoon began appearing in the Mason City, Iowa Globe Gazette , Artley described what he was trying to achieve in depicting Iowa farm life in the 1920s and 30s: \u201cI wanted to show how things used to be done,\u201d he said, \u201cthe mood of the times, the poetry of living then. I wanted to give proper perspective to a life that was good and can still be good.\" In 1982, his wife was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease which required constant care. After five years of home care, her condition worsened and she was moved to hospice at the Iowa Veterans Home where she stayed until shortly before her death in 1991 at the age of 74. Artley's book Ginny, a Love Remembered , about his wife's struggles and death, was endorsed by the Alzheimer's Association and contained a foreword by Princess Yasmin Aga Khan , daughter of 1940's starlett Rita Hayworth , who was active in Alzheimer's disease awareness due to her mother's struggles with the disease. Artley retired from full-time work in 1986. Retirement After his retirement, he continued drawing feature panels that were syndicated by Extra Newspaper Features Syndicate based at the Rochester (MN) Post-Bulletin . He also began writing his other books, including Christmas on the Farm , Living With Cows , and Country School Days \u2013 all richly illustrated with his drawings of rural and farm life. His books netted a substantial fan base in farming communities throughout the U.S. and Canada. His works were popular among rural regions of Europe as they were a study in life on the farm in the first years of the previous century regardless of country or geographical region. Through the 1990s, Artley made appearances on local talk shows, including Minneapolis' popular \"Boone & Erickson Show\" broadcast by WCCO-AM radio, to spin his stories of farm life. In 2007, many of Artley's cartoons were donated to Minnesota West Community and Technical College . With wife Ginny, he had four children: Jeannie, Robert, Steven, and Joan (Artley) Sterner. Daughter Jeannie died at the age of 54 after a battle with breast cancer. After his wife's death, Artley's book about their life together led to meeting his second wife Margaret (Hawes). Margaret, whose spouse had also died from Alzheimers, contacted Artley and they corresponded for a time. The couple was married in 1995 and resettled to Akron, OH . All three of Artley's surviving children collaborated on his last book, Memories of A Farm Kitchen , after Artley suffered a series of strokes while putting the book together. Rob, a retired school administrator, who has a monthly opinion column in his hometown Rochester Post-Bulletin, helped in final composing and received co-author credit. Steve, who followed in his father's footsteps as an editorial cartoonist, and Joan, an illustrator, helped their father with the book's artwork. Artley died a little over a year after publication, at the age of 94, and his inurnment was near his boyhood home in the Hampton Cemetery. He was survived by his three children, five step-children, 11 grandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren, 10 step-grandchildren, and 12 step-great-grandchildren.

{"id": "doc_random_047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarwanid_dynasty", "text": "The Jarwanid dynasty ( Arabic : \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0648\u0646 ) was an Arab dynasty that ruled Eastern Arabia in the 14th century. History The Jarwanids belonged to the clan of Bani Malik. It is disputed whether they belonged to the Banu Uqayl \u2014the tribe of their predecessors the Usfurids and their successors the Jabrids \u2014or to the Banu Abdul Qays , to whom the Uyunid dynasty (1076-1235) belonged. The Jarwanids came to power some time in the 14th century, after expelling the forces of Sa'eed ibn Mughamis, the chief of the Muntafiq tribe based in the Iraqi city of Basrah . Contemporary sources such Ibn Battuta and Ibn Hajar describe the Jarwanids as being \"extreme Rawafidh ,\" a term for Shi'ites who rejected the first three Caliphs , while a 15th-century Sunni scholar from Egypt describes them as being \"remnants of the Qarmatians .\" Historian Juan Cole concludes from this that they were Isma'ilis . However, the Twelver Shi'ite sect was promoted under their rule, and Twelver scholars held the judgeships and other important positions, including the chief of the hisba . Also, unlike under the Qarmatians , Islamic prayers were held in the mosques under Jarwanid rule, and prayer was called under the Shi'ite formula. A Twelver scholar of the 14th century, Jamaluddeen Al-Mutawwa', belonged to the house of Jarwan. According to Al-Humaydan, who specialized in the history of eastern Arabia , the Jarwanids were Twelvers, and the term \"Qaramita\" was used simply as an epithet for \"Shi'ite.\" Jarwanid rule came to an end in the 15th century at the hands of the Jabrids , a clan of the Banu Uqayl Bedouins .

{"id": "doc_random_048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michele_Viale-Prel%C3%A0", "text": "Michele Viale-Prel\u00e0 (29 September 1798 \u2013 15 May 1860) was an aristocratic Catholic priest from Corsica , France, who served as a diplomat for the Holy See in Switzerland, Bavaria and Austria. He became a Cardinal and the Archbishop of Bologna . When Bologna , formerly one of the Papal States , was incorporated into the Kingdom of Sardinia , he refused to recognize the new rulers. Life Early years (1798\u20131822) Michele Viale-Prel\u00e0 was born in Bastia , Corsica, on 29 September 1798 to a notable family of Genoese origin. His uncle Tommaso was the physician of Pope Pius VII and his brother Benedetto was the physician of Pope Pius IX . His brother Salvatore became distinguished as a writer. Michele Viale-Prel\u00e0 was given the clerical habit and tonsure in 1808 at the age of nine. He entered the Seminario Romano in Rome in 1814, then went to the Collegio Romano in Rome where he earned a doctorate in theology on 10 September 1823. He studied law and philosophy at the Sapienza University of Rome and earned a doctorate in philosophy. Diplomat (1822\u201355) Michele Viale-Prel\u00e0 was made a subdeacon on 21 September 1822. He was ordained as a priest on 29 September 1823. He worked at the secretariat of State of the Holy See as an assistant to Cardinal Luigi Lambruschini from 1824 to 1830. From 1828 to 1836 Viale-Prel\u00e0 was auditor in the Apostolic Nunciature in Switzerland. He again worked at the secretariat of State from 1836 to 1838. From 9 August 1838 to 1841 he was Apostolic Nuncio to Bavaria per pro in Munich . On 12 July 1841 Viale-Prel\u00e0 was appointed titular Archbishop of Cartagine. He was consecrated on 18 July 1841 in the church of San Carlo ai Catinari , Rome, by Cardinal Luigi Lambruschini and was made assistant at the Pontifical Throne on 20 July 1841. He continued as Apostolic Internuncio to Bavaria from 1841 to 1845. Viale-Prel\u00e0 was appointed Nuncio in Austria on 27 May 1845. He became close to Prince Klemens von Metternich and supported his policies even when they differed from the interests of the Papal States. After the Revolutions of 1848 he skillfully led the negotiations between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Holy See that were concluded in the mutually satisfactory agreement of 18 August 1855. This would last until the fall of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918. In the Papal consistory of 15 March 1852 he was made Cardinal reserved in pectore . His appointment was published on 7 March 1853. From 1853 to 1856 he continued as Pronuncio in Austria. Archbishop of Bologna (1855\u201360) On 28 September 1855 Viale-Prel\u00e0 was transferred to the Metropolitan See of Bolgona . He succeeded Carlo Oppizzoni and would in turn be succeeded by Filippo Maria Guidi. On 18 September 1856 he was appointed Cardinal-Priest of the church of Santi Andrea e Gregorio al Monte Celio in Rome. He remained in Vienna until 1856 to see through the implementation of the agreement, and began to govern to diocese of Bologna, a papal dominion, around the end of 1856. He gained a reputation as an opponent of liberalism, a strong supporter of the Pope's rule in the Papal States , a supporter of the Inquisition and a campaigner for morality and religious purification. His rigid and uncompromising stance drew a hostile reaction even from the clergy. During the Second Italian War of Independence the Austrian garrison in Bologna left early in the morning of 12 June 1859. By the end of the day the papal colors flying in the squares had been replaced with the Italian green, white and red, the Cardinal Legate had left the city, and a group styling itself Bologna's provisional government had proclaimed its desire to join the Kingdom of Sardinia. Bologna was promptly incorporated as part of the province of Romagna . Michele Viale-Prel\u00e0 tried to persuade the citizenry not to co-operate with the new civil authorities, but had little success. One of the new order's first official acts was to introduce freedom of religion and make all citizens equal before the law. Viale-Prel\u00e0 refused to have any dealings with the new rulers. Michele Viale-Prel\u00e0 died on 15 May 1860 at the age of 60. He was interred in Bologna Cathedral . He was an authoritarian prince of the church, opposed to democratic tendencies in the Cologne clergy, against the revolutions of 1848, for the independence of the church but in favor of state protection of the church. He was also a keen collector of contemporary German religious paintings. Notes ^ a b Frosali Viviana 2011 . ^ a b c d e f g h Salvador Miranda . ^ a b David M. Cheney . ^ Michael F.

SAAN is short for S urplus A rmy, A ir Force, N avy. The chain's head office was in Mississauga, Ontario , and its main distribution center and Stores Support Office complex were located in Winnipeg, with an additional distribution outlet in Montreal . SAAN also operated a small chain of clearance stores called Red Apple Clearance Centres . SAAN had more than 350 stores in the late 1990s; however, by May 2005, after it emerged from bankruptcy protection , this was reduced to 142 outlets in a number of communities (mostly smaller towns and cities) across Canada. History SAAN was established in 1947 by founders Albert and Sam Cohen, who opened their first store on Main Street in Winnipeg , Manitoba . Surplus items from the Canadian armed forces (hence the store's name) were the company's first supply source until its sales grew and more SAAN stores opened. From there, the number of stores grew to over 200 in Western Canada and Ontario , focusing on clothing, footwear and accessories. SAAN expanded into Eastern Canada in February 1997 with the acquisition of 89 locations once owned by other retailers including Greenbergs ; that same year, the chain added hard goods such as kitchen items, bed and bath items, furniture, toys, housewares, stationery and health and beauty products to their product lines. By the late 1990s, SAAN had more than 350 stores. By May 2005, however, after it emerged from bankruptcy protection , this was reduced to 142 outlets in a number of communities (mostly smaller towns and cities) across Canada. In June 2008, SAAN announced they would be closing all stores within 8 to 10 weeks, with a going-out-of-business sale being conducted by a joint venture group led by Great American Group LLC, which specialized in providing liquidation services. All remaining 126 stores closed within the following weeks, with some closing earlier than others. Most of the chain's locations and its intellectual properties were bought on an asset basis by TBS Holdings, owner of The Bargain! Shop chain, in August 2008.

These roads are the Warrego Highway , Oakey\u2013Cooyar Road and Dalby\u2013Cooyar Road. Several of the more significant internal roads intersect with Dalby\u2013Cooyar Road, and these are briefly described in this article, along with some significant external roads. Dalby\u2013Cooyar Road is a continuous 58.0 kilometres (36.0\u00a0mi) road route in the Western Downs and Toowoomba regions of Queensland. It is a regional road (number 416). It is part of the shortest route from the Sunshine Coast and Caboolture to Dalby. Route description The Dalby\u2013Cooyar Road commences at an intersection with the Bunya Highway (State Route 49) in Dalby . It leaves Dalby as Irvingdale Road and runs east, soon becoming Dalby\u2013Cooyar Road. It turns north-east and reaches the eastern boundary of Dalby, where it passes the exit to Dalby\u2013Nungil Road and turns north, passing between Dalby and Irvingdale before turning north-east and running through Kaimkillenbun from south to east. In Kaimkillenbun village it passes the exit to Bell\u2013Kaimkillenbun Road and turns east. At the eastern boundary of Kaimkillenbun it passes the exit to Bunya Mountains Road and enters Moola , which it runs through from west to east, passing the exit to Bowenville\u2013Moola Road. It then runs between Quinalow and Maclagan for a short distance before passing the exit to Pechey\u2013Maclagan Road and turning north-east into Maclagan. In Maclagan village Bunya Mountains\u2013Maclagan Road exits to the west and then turns north. Dalby\u2013Cooyar Road continues north-east through Maclagan until it nears the eastern boundary, where it turns east and enters Nutgrove . The road ends at an intersection with Oakey\u2013Cooyar Road (State Route 68) in Nutgrove. Land use along this road is mainly crop farming. This road is part of a network that enables access to the locality of Bunya Mountains from three lowland points, thus providing alternatives in case of flooding, other natural disasters, or planned maintenance. Internal roads Pechey\u2013Maclagan Road Main article: Pechey\u2013Maclagan Road Pechey\u2013Maclagan Road is a state-controlled district road (number 418), rated as a local road of regional significance (LRRS). It starts at Pechey on the New England Highway and runs west through several localities before entering the triangle at Rosalie Plains on the Oakey\u2013Cooyar Road. It continues west to Brymaroo , where it turns north to Maclagan and ends at the Dalby\u2013Cooyar Road. In Brymaroo it intersects with Jondaryan\u2013Nungil Road, thus providing a direct south-north link from the Warrego Highway at Jondaryan to Maclagan. Bowenville\u2013Moola Road This road provides a direct south-north link from the Warrego Highway at Bowenville to the Dalby\u2013Cooyar Road. Dalby\u2013Nungil Road This road runs east from Dalby, intersecting with Bowenville\u2013Moola Road and Pechey\u2013Maclagan Road, thus providing a direct west-east link from Dalby to Rosalie Plains and beyond. External roads Bunya Mountains Road Main article: Bunya Mountains Road Bunya Mountains Road is a state-controlled district road (number 4161), rated LRRS. It runs from Dalby\u2013Cooyar Road to the Bunya Mountains . It is part of the shortest route from Dalby to the Bunya Mountains.

A post office opened in 1855 and a school in 1861. The railway arrived in 1868, allowing the town to grow as the commercial centre for properties around it. Irvingdale pastoral run was established in the 1840s. In 1849 a pastoral run named Cumkillenbar was established in the area now named Kaimkillenbun. The first roads were cut to enable access to the pastoral runs and other settlements for wheeled vehicles. In 1889 the town that is now Maclagan was surveyed, and a butter and cheese factory was established in Quinalow. A reliable road connection from these towns to Dalby was needed to provide access to markets and larger items of equipment. The extension of the road to Cooyar was the logical completion of a \"missing link\". Cooyar was first established as a pastoral run. In 1877 a total of 18,500 acres (7,500\u00a0ha) was resumed from Cooyar to enable the establishment of smaller farms. Major intersections All distances are from Google Maps.

The sixth five-year plan was adopted, based on the economic goals declared at the 12th Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party . The constitution and the election rules were amended in 1983, allowing for multiple candidates in every single-member district and the recall of elected representatives.

{"id": "doc_random_053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Dog", "text": "Angel Dog is a 2011 family film about how a dog named Cooper, a survivor of a car accident, bonds with Jake and helps him get over a tragic loss. This film is written and directed by Robin Nations and produced and cinematography by Kevin Nations. The two are a husband and wife team that go by The Nations. The film\u2019s score was composed and performed by singer-songwriter Peter Himmelman . The film premiered in Los Angeles, California, at the 2011 International Family Film Festival on March 19, 2011. Background After The Nations produced and directed their second film, Leftovers , the husband and wife team, inspired by their love of dogs, set out to make a family dog film. Angel Dog marked their first push towards their mission to \u201cbring back family movie night\u201d. Premise A dog named Cooper is the only survivor of a deadly car accident where Jake lost his wife and children. Jake dislikes dogs and vents his anger on the dog for surviving. However, a bond forms between Jake and Cooper that gives him some solace. Cast Jon Michael Davis as Jake Bryant Farah White as Caroline Mason Richard Dillard as Seth Mona Lee Fultz as Bobbie Maurice Ripke as Trey Ashley Hallford as Nita Reception Angel Dog received a 5 Dove rating from The Dove Foundation , which is the foundation\u2019s highest honor possible. Reviewer Edwin L. Carpenter stated, \u201c Angel Dog is a movie which adults, along with kids, will enjoy. Don\u2019t let the title fool you. The movie deals with something everyone can relate to: death and loss, and the subsequent grieving process. Yet \u201cCooper\u201d, a stray, is a lovable dog who seems to have a mission: to help those who are lonely following a loss. Then he moves on to the next need.\u201d Tracey Moore from Common Sense Media gave three stars from five in her review, commenting: ... \"Angel Dog is a sweet, heartfelt film about loss that reinforces the value and importance of moving on, and suggests that people (and pets) may all enter our lives for a reason. It offers important positive messages about kindness, compassion, and creating the space for a person to grieve in a healthy, unrushed way. This is contrasted by showing what it's like when people don't move on, and are stuck in a lifetime of pain and unable to let go. That said, it's a heavy dose of real-world suffering ..\" References ^ \"Angel Dog | Dove Family Friendly Movie Reviews\" . Dove.org . ^ \"Angel Dog - Movie Review\" . www.commonsensemedia.org .

He is the founder, former chief executive officer, and former executive chairman of Chipotle Mexican Grill . Ells founded Chipotle in 1993, and under his direction, the chain serves what it describes as \"naturally raised meat\" and promotes sustainable agriculture . In November 2017, Chipotle announced Ells' resignation as CEO, pending the search for a new CEO with \"turnaround expertise\". Ells was executive chairman following the appointment of a new CEO, and was on the CEO search committee. Brian Niccol became CEO of Chipotle in February 2018. In March 2020, Ells resigned as chairman and left the board of directors, breaking his final ties to the company. Early life Ells was born in Indianapolis on September 12, 1965, the son of a pharmaceutical executive. He attended Boulder High School and the University of Colorado at Boulder where he received a bachelor's degree in Art History and became a member of the Delta Chi fraternity. Ells later enrolled at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York , graduating in 1990. Career Ells worked for two years as a sous chef under Jeremiah Tower at Stars restaurant in San Francisco prior to launching Chipotle. Ells opened a chipotle themed taco store in Denver, Colorado near the University of Denver campus using $85,000 borrowed from his family and friends. Ells was CEO of the chain from 1993 until 2009, when he split co-CEO duties with Monty Moran. Ells returned as sole CEO on December 12, 2016, upon Moran's retirement. In 2007, Ells received the CEO of the Year Award from ColoradoBiz magazine. He formerly sat on the board of directors of the Land Institute . In 2010, Ells joined the judging and investment panel on NBC 's series America's Next Great Restaurant alongside Bobby Flay , Curtis Stone and Lorena Garcia . Ells had not previously watched reality television and was disillusioned with the experience. Chipotle announced on November 29, 2017, that Ells would step down as CEO following the appointment of a new CEO with \"turnaround expertise.\" Ells was executive chairman after the new CEO appointment, and was on the CEO search committee with fellow Chipotle board members Robin Hickenlooper and Ali Namvar. Ells left the company in March 2020. In May 2025, Forbes reported that Ells had become a billionaire 32 years after founding Chipotle. Controversies Ells has received criticism over his salary. In 2013, The New York Times reported he was paid $25.1 million, more than equivalent executives in companies like Ford , Boeing , and AT&T . By the early 2010s, Ells and his co-CEO, Montgomery Moran, were paid more than $300 million. In May 2014, shareholders rejected a plan to further increase the executives' wages.

{"id": "doc_random_059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_pattern", "text": "In combinatorial mathematics and theoretical computer science , a (classical) permutation pattern is a sub-permutation of a longer permutation . Any permutation may be written in one-line notation as a sequence of entries representing the result of applying the permutation to the sequence 123...; for instance the sequence 213 represents the permutation on three elements that swaps elements 1 and 2. If \u03c0 and \u03c3 are two permutations represented in this way (these variable names are standard for permutations and are unrelated to the number pi ), then \u03c0 is said to contain \u03c3 as a pattern if some subsequence of the entries of \u03c0 has the same relative order as all of the entries of \u03c3. For instance, permutation \u03c0 contains the pattern 213 whenever \u03c0 has three entries x , y , and z that appear within \u03c0 in the order x ... y ... z but whose values are ordered as y \u00a0<\u00a0 x \u00a0<\u00a0 z , the same as the ordering of the values in the permutation 213. The permutation 32415 on five elements contains 213 as a pattern in several different ways: 3\u00b7\u00b715, \u00b7\u00b7415, 32\u00b7\u00b75, 324\u00b7\u00b7, and \u00b72\u00b715 all form triples of entries with the same ordering as 213. Note that the entries do not need to be consecutive. Each of the subsequences 315, 415, 325, 324, and 215 is called a copy, instance, or occurrence of the pattern. The fact that \u03c0 contains \u03c3 is written more concisely as \u03c3 \u2264 \u03c0. If a permutation \u03c0 does not contain a pattern \u03c3, then \u03c0 is said to avoid \u03c3. The permutation 51342 avoids 213; it has ten subsequences of three entries, but none of these ten subsequences has the same ordering as 213. An international conference dedicated to permutation patterns and related topics has been held annually since 2003, called Permutation Patterns . Early results A case can be made that Percy MacMahon \u00a0( 1915 ) was the first to prove a result in the field with his study of \"lattice permutations\". In particular MacMahon shows that the permutations which can be divided into two decreasing subsequences (i.e., the 123-avoiding permutations) are counted by the Catalan numbers . Another early landmark result in the field is the Erd\u0151s\u2013Szekeres theorem ; in permutation pattern language, the theorem states that for any positive integers a and b every permutation of length at least ( a \u2212 1 ) ( b \u2212 1 ) + 1 {\\displaystyle (a-1)(b-1)+1} must contain either the pattern 1 , 2 , 3 , \u2026 , a {\\displaystyle 1,2,3,\\dots ,a} or the pattern b , b \u2212 1 , \u2026 , 2 , 1 {\\displaystyle b,b-1,\\dots ,2,1} . Computer science origins The study of permutation patterns began in earnest with Donald Knuth 's consideration of stack-sorting in 1968. Knuth showed that the permutation \u03c0 can be sorted by a stack if and only if \u03c0 avoids 231, and that the stack-sortable permutations are enumerated by the Catalan numbers . Knuth also raised questions about sorting with deques . In particular, Knuth's question asking how many permutation of n elements are obtainable with the use of a deque remains open. Shortly thereafter, Robert Tarjan \u00a0( 1972 ) investigated sorting by networks of stacks, while Vaughan Pratt \u00a0( 1973 ) showed that the permutation \u03c0 can be sorted by a deque if and only if for all k , \u03c0 avoids 5,2,7,4,...,4 k +1,4 k \u22122,3,4 k ,1, and 5,2,7,4,...,4 k +3,4 k ,1,4 k +2,3, and every permutation that can be obtained from either of these by interchanging the last two elements or the 1 and the 2. Because this collection of permutations is infinite (in fact, it is the first published example of an infinite antichain of permutations), it is not immediately clear how long it takes to decide if a permutation can be sorted by a deque. Rosenstiehl & Tarjan (1984) later presented a linear (in the length of \u03c0) time algorithm which determines if \u03c0 can be sorted by a deque. In his paper, Pratt remarked that this permutation pattern order \u201cseems to be the only partial order on permutation that arises in a simple and natural way\u201d and concludes by noting that \u201cfrom an abstract point of view\u201d, the permutation pattern order \u201cis even more interesting than the networks we were characterizing\u201d. Enumerative origins Main article: Enumerations of specific permutation classes A prominent goal in the study of permutation patterns is in the enumeration of permutations avoiding a fixed (and typically short) permutation or set of permutations. Let Av n (B) denote the set of permutations of length n which avoid all of the permutations in the set B . (In the case B is a singleton, say { \u03b2 }, the abbreviation Av n ( \u03b2 ) is used instead.) As noted above, MacMahon and Knuth showed that |Av n (123)| = |Av n (231)| = C n , the n th Catalan number. Thus these are isomorphic combinatorial classes . Simion & Schmidt (1985) was the first paper to focus solely on enumeration. Among other results, Simion and Schmidt counted even and odd permutations avoiding a pattern of length three, counted permutations avoiding two patterns of length three , and gave the first bijective proof that 123- and 231-avoiding permutations are equinumerous. Since their paper, many other bijections have been given, see Claesson & Kitaev (2008) for a survey. In general, if |Av n ( \u03b2 )| = |Av n ( \u03c3 )| for all n , then \u03b2 and \u03c3 are said to be Wilf-equivalent . Many Wilf-equivalences stem from the trivial fact that |Av n ( \u03b2 )| = |Av n ( \u03b2 \u22121 )| = |Av n ( \u03b2 rev )| for all n , where \u03b2 \u22121 denotes the inverse of \u03b2 and \u03b2 rev denotes the reverse of \u03b2 . (These two operations generate the Dihedral group D 8 with a natural action on permutation matrices .) However, there are also numerous examples of nontrivial Wilf-equivalences (such as that between 123 and 231): Stankova (1994) proved that the permutations 1342 and 2413 are Wilf-equivalent. Stankova & West (2002) proved that for any permutation \u03b2 , the permutations 231 \u2295 \u03b2 and 312 \u2295 \u03b2 are Wilf-equivalent, where \u2295 denotes the direct sum operation. Backelin, West & Xin (2007) proved that for any permutation \u03b2 and any positive integer m , the permutations 12... m \u2295 \u03b2 and m ...21\u00a0\u2295\u00a0 \u03b2 are Wilf-equivalent. From these two Wilf-equivalences and the inverse and reverse symmetries, it follows that there are three different sequences |Av n ( \u03b2 )| where \u03b2 is of length four: In the late 1980s, Richard Stanley and Herbert Wilf conjectured that for every permutation \u03b2 , there is some constant K such that |Av n ( \u03b2 )| < K n . This was known as the Stanley\u2013Wilf conjecture until it was proved by Adam Marcus and G\u00e1bor Tardos . Permutation classes Main article: Permutation class A permutation class , also known as a pattern class (mostly in older work), or simply a class of permutations is a downset in the permutation pattern order. Every class can be defined by the minimal permutations which do not lie inside it, its basis . Thus the basis for the stack-sortable permutations is {231}, while the basis for the deque-sortable permutations is known to be infinite. The generating function for a class is \u03a3 x |\u03c0| where the sum is taken over all permutations \u03c0 in the class. M\u00f6bius function As the set of permutations under the containment order forms a poset it is natural to ask about its M\u00f6bius function , a goal first explicitly presented by Wilf (2002) . The goal in such investigations is to find a formula for the M\u00f6bius function of an interval [\u03c3, \u03c0] in the permutation pattern poset which is more efficient than the na\u00efve recursive definition. The first such result was established by Sagan & Vatter (2006) , who gave a formula for the M\u00f6bius function of an interval of layered permutations . Later, Burstein et al. (2011) generalized this result to intervals of separable permutations . It is known that, asymptotically, at least 39.95% of all permutations \u03c0 of length n satisfy \u03bc(1, \u03c0)=0 (that is, the principal M\u00f6bius function is equal to zero), but for each n there exist permutations \u03c0 such that \u03bc(1, \u03c0) is an exponential function of n . Computational complexity Given a permutation \u03c4 {\\displaystyle \\tau } (called the text ) of length n {\\displaystyle n} and another permutation \u03c0 {\\displaystyle \\pi } of length k {\\displaystyle k} (called the pattern ), the permutation pattern matching (PPM) problem asks whether \u03c0 {\\displaystyle \\pi } is contained in \u03c4 {\\displaystyle \\tau } . When both n {\\displaystyle n} and k {\\displaystyle k} are regarded as variables, the problem is known to be NP-complete , and the problem of counting the number of such matches is #P-complete . However, PPM can be solved in linear time when k is a constant. Indeed, Guillemot and Marx showed that PPM can be solved in time 2 O ( k 2 log \u2061 k ) \u22c5 n {\\displaystyle 2^{O(k^{2}\\log k)}\\cdot n} , meaning that it is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to k {\\displaystyle k} . There are several variants on the PPM problem, as surveyed by Bruner and Lackner. For example, if the match is required to consist of contiguous entries then the problem can be solved in polynomial time. A different natural variant is obtained when the pattern is restricted to a proper permutation class C {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}} . This problem is known as C {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}} -Pattern PPM and it was shown to be polynomial-time solvable for separable permutations . Later, Jel\u00ednek and Kyn\u010dl completely resolved the complexity of Av ( \u03c3 ) {\\displaystyle {\\mbox{Av}}(\\sigma )} -Pattern PPM by showing that it is polynomial-time solvable when \u03c3 {\\displaystyle \\sigma } is equal to one of 1, 12, 21, 132, 231, 312 or 213 and NP-complete otherwise. Another variant is when both the pattern and text are restricted to a proper permutation class C {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}} , in which case the problem is called C {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}} -PPM. For example, Guillemot and Vialette showed that Av ( 321 ) {\\displaystyle {\\mbox{Av}}(321)} -PPM could be solved in O ( k 2 n 6 ) {\\displaystyle O(k^{2}n^{6})} time. Albert , Lackner, Lackner, and Vatter later lowered this to O ( k n ) {\\displaystyle O(kn)} and showed that the same bound holds for the class of skew-merged permutations . They further asked if the C {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}} -PPM problem can be solved in polynomial time for every fixed proper permutation class C {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}} . This question was answered negatively by Jel\u00ednek and Kyn\u010dl who showed that Av ( 4321 ) {\\displaystyle {\\mbox{Av}}(4321)} -PPM is in fact NP-complete. Later, Jel\u00ednek, Opler, and Pek\u00e1rek showed that Av ( \u03c3 ) {\\displaystyle {\\mbox{Av}}(\\sigma )} -PPM is NP-complete for any \u03c3 {\\displaystyle \\sigma } of length at least 4 not symmetric to one of 3412, 3142, 4213, 4123 or 41352. Packing densities The permutation \u03c0 is said to be \u03b2- optimal if no permutation of the same length as \u03c0 has more copies of \u03b2. In his address to the SIAM meeting on Discrete Mathematics in 1992, Wilf defined the packing density of the permutation \u03b2 of length k as lim n \u2192 \u221e number of copies of \u03b2 in a \u03b2 -optimal permutation of length n ( n k ) . {\\displaystyle \\lim _{n\\rightarrow \\infty }{\\frac {{\\text{number of copies of }}\\beta {\\text{ in a }}\\beta {\\text{-optimal permutation of length }}n}{\\displaystyle {n \\choose k}}}.} An unpublished argument of Fred Galvin shows that the quantity inside this limit is nonincreasing for n \u2265 k , and so the limit exists. When \u03b2 is monotone, its packing density is clearly 1, and packing densities are invariant under the group of symmetries generated by inverse and reverse, so for permutations of length three, there is only one nontrivial packing density. Walter Stromquist (unpublished) settled this case by showing that the packing density of 132 is 2 \u221a 3 \u00a0\u2212\u00a03 , approximately 0.46410. For permutations \u03b2 of length four, there are (due to symmetries) seven cases to consider: For the three unknown permutations, there are bounds and conjectures. Price (1997) used an approximation algorithm which suggests that the packing density of 1324 is around 0.244. Birzhan Batkeyev (unpublished) constructed a family of permutations showing that the packing density of 1342 is at least the product of the packing densities of 132 and 1432, approximately 0.19658. This is conjectured to be the precise packing density of 1342. Presutti & Stromquist (2010) provided a lower bound on the packing density of 2413. This lower bound, which can be expressed in terms of an integral, is approximately 0.10474, and conjectured to be the true packing density. Superpatterns Main article: Superpattern A k - superpattern is a permutation that contains all permutations of length k . For example, 25314 is a 3-superpattern because it contains all 6 permutations of length 3. It is known that k -superpatterns must have length at least k 2 / e 2 , where e \u00a0\u2248 2.71828 is Euler's number , and that there exist k -superpatterns of length \u2308( k 2 \u00a0+\u00a01)/2\u2309. This upper bound is conjectured to be best possible, up to lower-order terms. Generalizations The type of pattern defined above, in which entries do not need to occur consecutively, is called a classical (permutation) pattern. If the entries are required to be consecutive, then the pattern is called a consecutive pattern . There are several ways in which the notion of \"pattern\" has been generalized. For example, a vincular pattern is a permutation containing dashes indicating which adjacent pairs of entries need not occur consecutively. For example, the permutation 314265 has two copies of the dashed pattern 2\u221231\u22124, given by the entries 3426 and 3425. For a dashed pattern \u03b2 and any permutation \u03c0, we write \u03b2(\u03c0) for the number of copies of \u03b2 in \u03c0. Thus the number of inversions in \u03c0 is 2\u22121(\u03c0), while the number of descents is 21(\u03c0). Going further, the number of valleys in \u03c0 is 213(\u03c0) + 312(\u03c0), while the number of peaks is 231(\u03c0) + 132(\u03c0). These patterns were introduced by Babson & Steingr\u00edmsson (2000) , who showed that almost all known Mahonian statistics could be expressed in terms of vincular permutations. For example, the Major index of \u03c0 is equal to 1\u221232(\u03c0) + 2\u221231(\u03c0) + 3\u221221(\u03c0) + 21(\u03c0). Another generalization is that of a barred pattern , in which some of the entries are barred. For \u03c0 to avoid the barred pattern \u03b2 means that every set of entries of \u03c0 which form a copy of the nonbarred entries of \u03b2 can be extended to form a copy of all entries of \u03b2. West (1993) introduced these types of patterns in his study of permutations which could be sorted by passing them twice through a stack. (Note that West's definition of sorting twice through a stack is not the same as sorting with two stacks in series.) Another example of barred patterns occurs in the work of Bousquet-M\u00e9lou & Butler (2007) , who showed that the Schubert variety corresponding to \u03c0 is locally factorial if and only if \u03c0 avoids 1324 and 21 3 54.

The waters, such as they are, drain into this brackish low-lying closed basin area off the Omani mountains and the wadis of the Rub al'khali. The Al Samim (known locally as the 'Mother of Poisons' or the 'Mother of Worries') is a salt marsh with a solid-looking crust, but can be very treacherous when broken through. There is little vegetation. Sir Wilfred Thesiger was the first European to see the area in the late 1940s after his travels from Salalah in Oman. References ^ Rabi, Uzi (2006).

{"id": "doc_random_062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measures_of_pollutant_concentration", "text": "Measures of pollutant concentration are used to determine risk assessment in public health . Industry is continually synthesizing new chemicals, the regulation of which requires evaluation of the potential danger for human health and the environment . Risk assessment is nowadays considered essential for making these decisions on a scientifically sound basis. Measures or defined limits include: no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL), also called no-effect concentration (NEC), no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) or similarly lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) ECx (in percentage). No-effect concentration No-effect concentration (NEC) is a risk assessment parameter that represents the concentration of a pollutant that will not harm the species involved, with respect to the effect that is studied. It is often the starting point for environmental policy . There is not much debate on the existence of an NEC, but the assignment of a value is another matter. Current practice consists of the use of standard tests. In the standard tests groups of animals are exposed to different concentrations of chemicals and different effects such as survival, growth or reproduction are monitored. These toxicity tests typically result in a no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC, also called a no-observed-effect level , or NOEL). This NOEC has been severely criticized on statistical grounds by several authors and it was concluded that the NOEC should be abandoned. ECx A proposed alternative is the use of so-called ECx \u2013 the concentration(s) showing x % effect (e.g. an EC 50 in a survival experiment indicates the concentration where 50% of the test animals would die in that experiment). ECx concentrations also have their problems in applying them to risk assessment. Any other value for x other than zero may give the impression that an effect is accepted, and this is in conflict with the aim of maximally protecting the environment. In addition ECx values do depend on the exposure time. ECx values for survival decrease for increasing exposure time, until equilibrium has been established. This is because effects depend on internal concentrations, and that it takes time for the compound to penetrate the body of test organisms. However, sub-lethal endpoints (e.g., body size, reproductive output) may reveal less predictable effect patterns in time. The shape of the effect patterns over time depends on properties of the test compound, properties of the organism, the endpoint considered and the dimensions in which the endpoint is expressed (e.g., body size or body weight ; reproduction rate or cumulative reproduction). Biology-based Biology-based methods not only aim to describe observed effects, but also to understand them in terms of underlying processes such as toxicokinetics , mortality, feeding, growth and reproduction (Kooijman 1997). This type of approach starts with the description of the uptake and elimination of a compound by an organism, as an effect can only be expected if the compound is inside the organism, and where the no-effect-concentration is one of the modeling parameters. As the approach is biologically based it is also possible by using the dynamic energy budget theory to incorporate multiple stressors (e.g. effects of food restriction, temperature, etc.) and processes that are active under field conditions (e.g. adaptation , population dynamics, species interactions, life cycle phenomena, etc.). The effects of these multiple stressors are excluded in the standard test procedures by keeping the local environment in the test constant. It is also possible to use these parameter values to predict effects at longer exposure times, or effects when the concentration in the medium is not constant. If the observed effects include those on survival and reproduction of individuals, these parameters can also be used to predict effects on growing populations in the field.

{"id": "doc_random_064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_on_Extasy", "text": "Jesus on Extasy (abbreviated \"JoE\") is an electronic rock band from Essen, Germany , formed in 2005 by Dorian Deveraux and Chai Deveraux. The band's musical style can be described as a hybrid of rock and metal elements and electronic music. After breaking up in 2014, the band announced their reunion on their Facebook page in October 2020. History Jesus On Extasy during a promotional photo shoot at the world heritage site Zeche Zollverein , Essen Germany . Picture by Marina P\u00e4sler The first demo EP \"Assassinate Us\" was produced in 2005 in Chai Deveraux's own Sinustal studio in Essen, where the band also worked on the pre-productions for their albums in later years. The EP was described in the \"Demozone\" section of the music magazine Sonic Seducer in the review by music journalist Francois Duchateau as a record \"that not only promises, but delivers what the potential promises\". Jesus on Extasy made their first appearance in July 2006 at the Bochum Total Festival, one of the largest music festivals in Europe. As part of this performance, the record company Drakkar Entertainment signed the band a short time later. The debut album Holy Beauty was released on March 30, 2007, and received mostly positive reviews. In addition to ten original songs, a remix of the single \"Assassinate Me\" by industrial metal pioneers KMFDM was also included on the album. In March, as part of the album's release, the band embarked on a short tour with violin-rock band Letzte Instanz , also signed to Drakkar Entertainment. This was followed by an extensive Germany tour in May with Dope Stars Inc. (Italy) and Entwine (Finland). Various festival appearances followed in the summer of the same year, including Bochum Total, the Woodstage Festival \u00a0(with Marilyn Manson and Type O Negative ) and the M'era Luna Festival, as well as a headlining Germany tour in the fall, in which Jesus on Extasy were supported as supporting act at some concerts by the Hamburg post-industrial band Philiae . At the end of the year the band performed at the festival series \"On A Dark Winter's Night\" in Salzburg and Oberhausen together with bands like Nightwish and Dope Stars Inc. In May 2008, Jesus on Extasy released their second album, Beloved Enemy , through Drakkar Entertainment . It entered the German Alternative Charts (GAC) at number 1 and was again given mostly positive reviews. In order to promote the album, festival appearances followed, among others at the Wave Gotik Treffen or the Summer Breeze Festival in Dinkelsb\u00fchl , as well as an autumn tour supporting the Neue-Deutsche-H\u00e4rte band Eisbrecher . 2009 marked the first year in the band's existence that Jesus on Extasy did not release an album. The band played selected festival gigs, including the Amphi Festival in Cologne and the M'era Luna Festival in Hildesheim . The band said they wanted to concentrate on the production of the third album. Also in 2010, the band let their live activities largely rest and only played a few selected concerts, including in the Hamburg Prinzenbar, at the Blackfield Festival in Gelsenkirchen and a headlining gig in the city of Donaueschingen . The third, self-produced album No Gods was released on August 27, 2010, through Drakkar Entertainment (in Europe and the rest of the world) and Artoffact Records (American continent). In January 2011, Jesus on Extasy announced the split from singer Dorian Deveraux . Bassist BJ and keyboardist Ophelia Dax also left the band. After joining the Norwegian synth-rock band Apoptygma Berzerk , Dax was no longer able to be a part of Jesus On Extasy. \u00a0Chai Deveraux then founded his own label Farscape Records and found a new voice for Jesus On Extasy in singer Manja Kaletka. On October 7, 2011, the studio album The Clock \u00a0was released. In the same year the band went on tour with the German gothic metal band Lord of the Lost . In December 2014, the band announced their dissolution. \u00a0After short teaser videos were published on the official Jesus On Extasy Facebook page in autumn 2020 after a long period of inactivity, the band announced on October 31, 2020, that they wanted to release another album with Dorian Deveraux as singer. In 2021 industrial rock pioneers KMFDM scheduled Jesus On Extasy as a support act for their 2022 Europe tour, but due to COVID restrictions the tour was first pushed to 2023 and then cancelled entirely after the headliner's decision to cease touring Europe \"for good\", as singer Sascha Konietzko stated on his personal Facebook page. Musical style The band combines influences of synth rock , industrial rock and glam rock . The strong contrast between the electronic sounds and the hard guitar elements has become the band's trademark style. Chai Deveraux also used those influences as a remixer in his interpretations of songs from other bands. In his Sinustal recording studio in Essen, Chai has produced remixes for bands such as ASP , Krieger, New Model Army , Dommin and Xandria . Reception Holy Beauty The band's debut album, Holy Beauty , was largely positively received by the music press. The German music magazine Zillo dedicated the cover of its March 2007 issue to Jesus on Extasy and gave the band the title \"Newcomer of the Year\". Music journalist Sascha Blach praised the \"stimulating sounds somewhere between industrial, gothic and rock\" in his review. The pieces on the album were \"easy to catch\" and were convincing \"especially in terms of the melody,\" Blach continued. Sonic Seducer magazine called the band \"New Industrial Rock Highlight\" in its March 2007 issue and wrote that Jesus on Extasy are the \"prophets on the digital rock horizon\" that \"the New Generation has been screaming at the top of their lungs for\". With their debut album, the band \"undoubtedly nailed a classic to the cross\". Orkus magazine named JoE \"Newcomer of the Month\" in its April 2007 issue. Michael Edele from the online magazine laut.de praised the band's \"absolutely positive overall impression of the debut\". Powermetal.de attested the band a \"first-class album of unconventional music\" that was \"a true rejuvenation for a somewhat dusty and deadlocked genre\". Beloved Enemy Sascha Blach of the music magazine Zillo praised the fact that the album was \"not just a rehash of the debut\" and that the production was \"more organic, rougher and heavier\". \"A broad spectrum in the intersection of rock, alternative, electronic and gothic is served\", which makes the band \"attractive for different target groups\". Zillo magazine devoted its front page and a multi-page cover story to Jesus On Extasy on the occasion of the release of their second album, Beloved Enemy . The band has also been featured on the covers of Orkus, Gothic magazine, Rockoon and Negatief. In 2008, teen magazines also became aware of Jesus On Extasy. In December 2008, the youth newspaper Popcorn called the band one of the \"coolest bands in the emo scene\" on a double page spread. The same medium called singer Dorian Deveraux one of the \"new cult stars\" in its March 2009 issue. In terms of music, the magazine Be Subjective praised above all that the album was a heavy chunk in terms of content due to the \"post-oriented mood and critical side swipes\". However, \"the songs are varied\" and convince \"with creativity, dynamics, catchy melodies and rhythms and know how to captivate in this way\". No Gods The band's third album also received mostly positive reviews. The online magazine Terrorverlag, which is otherwise rather critical of the band, praised the \"rockier, more biting sound\" and \"a catchiness that cannot be denied\". Powermetal.de saw solid industrial metal in the album as well as maintaining the level of the previous albums, but without further development. Monkeypress.de, on the other hand, liked the willingness to take risks with which the album was produced after many personnel changes: \"the changes in the JOE camp had a positive effect, as more daring was done here and almost gone all the way.\" Laut.de found the album \"unusually snappy\" and attested to the band's \"unmistakable progress in terms of songwriting\", but struggled with the singer's vocal performance.

{"id": "doc_random_065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Inter_Flight_148", "text": "Air Inter Flight 148 was a scheduled passenger flight from Lyon-Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Airport (formerly known as Lyon Satolas Airport) to Strasbourg Airport in France . On 20 January 1992, the Airbus A320 operating the flight crashed into the slopes of the Vosges Mountains in Eastern France, near Mont Sainte-Odile , while on a non-precision approach to Strasbourg Airport. A total of 87 of the 96 people on board were killed, while the remaining 9 were all injured. Accident Flight 148 was commanded by 42-year-old Captain Christian Hecquet, with 8,800 flight hours, including 162 flight hours on the Airbus A320, & 37-year-old First Officer Jo\u00ebl Cherubin, with 3,600 flight hours, including 61 hours on the A320. The aircraft left Lyon-Satolas (now called Lyon-Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Airport ) at 17:20 UTC. Both pilots were relatively new to the A320 , with a combined total of only 300 hours in the aircraft, but they both were familiar with Strasbourg Airport as both had flown into the airport many times. As the flight neared Strasbourg Airport, they informed ATC of their desire to follow the ILS approach for Runway 23 until the airport was in sight, followed by a visual approach onto Runway 05. This type of approach onto Runway 05 was common at Strasbourg Airport; Runway 05 was not equipped with ILS since the nearby mountains and high terrain would interfere with the glide slope signal transmitted by the ILS. ATC denied the pilots approach request, saying there would be a significant delay because of conflict with several aircraft departing on Runway 05 and instead offered vectors for the VOR / DME approach for Runway 05, which the pilots accepted. The flight was cleared to descend to 5,000\u00a0ft and vectored to the ANDLO waypoint 11 nautical miles from the Strasbourg Airport VOR . ATC cleared the aircraft onto the final approach at 18:19 UTC as it passed ANDLO, where the pilots turned left onto the runway heading of 050 degrees and continued to descend as per the approach chart. At 18:20:33 UTC, Flight 148 crashed into the slopes of Mont Sainte-Odile at 2,620\u00a0ft, 10.5 nautical miles from the airport. The search and rescue operation commenced at 18:40. Three helicopters, 24 motorcycles, and 950 people from the Police Nationale , National Gendarmerie , S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Civile , as well as 24 amateur radio operators, participated in the search and rescue operation. Although almost 1,000 people were involved in the search effort, it was criticised for being unprepared and disorganised, as it was not clear which of the three agencies would lead the search for the crash site, hampering the search and rescue effort. The crash site was not discovered until 22:35 UTC (4 hours and 15 minutes later) when a group of journalists were led to the wreckage by a surviving passenger, Nicolas Skourias. The first rescuers, a group of gendarmes , arrived at 22:49 after being led to the wreckage by the same survivor and a journalist. Cause The Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) found that Flight 148 crashed because the pilots left the autopilot set in Vertical Speed Mode, which uses feet per minute to determine descent rates, instead of Flight Path Angle Mode, which uses the angle of the aircraft in flight, and then set \"33\" for \"3.3\u00b0 descent angle. At the time, the display showing the descent rate in feet only showed the first two digits, so 3,300 feet per minute would be displayed as 33, not 3300. As a result, instead of a gradual 3.3\u00b0 of descent, the aircraft instead entered a high descent rate of 3,300\u00a0ft (1,000\u00a0m) per minute until it impacted the mountain. The pilots had no warning of the imminent impact because Air Inter had not equipped its aircraft with a ground proximity warning system (GPWS). At the time, a GPWS was not required on A320 aircraft. It is speculated that the lack of a GPWS was because Air Inter, facing strong competition from France's TGV high-speed trains, may have encouraged its pilots to fly fast at low level (up to 350\u00a0kn\u00a0[650\u00a0km/h; 400\u00a0mph] below 10,000\u00a0ft\u00a0[3,000\u00a0m], while other airlines generally do not exceed 250\u00a0kn\u00a0[460\u00a0km/h; 290\u00a0mph]), and flying at those increased speeds at low altitudes caused a GPWS to give too many nuisance warnings. Aircraft The aircraft involved, manufactured in 1988, was an Airbus A320-111 , registered as F-GGED, with serial number 015. At the time of the accident, the aircraft had accumulated a total of 6,316 airframe hours & 7,194 takeoff and landing cycles. Aftermath The crash site of Flight 148 with a memorial plaque Accident investigators recommended 35 changes in their report. Airbus modified the interface of the autopilot so that a vertical speed setting would be displayed as a four-digit number, preventing confusion with the Flight Path Angle mode. The flight data recorder , which was destroyed before investigators could obtain any data, due to extended exposure to the post-crash fire, was upgraded so that it could withstand higher temperatures, & for a longer period of time. The report also recommended that pilot training for the A320 should be enhanced, and that ground proximity warning systems should be required to be installed on all A320 aircraft as part of the minimum equipment list. Air Inter equipped its aircraft with ground proximity warning systems before the investigation was completed. Notable deaths Jean-Pierre Lecocq , Belgian molecular biologist and entrepreneur . Dramatization The story of the disaster was featured on the ninth season of the Cineflix television show Mayday in the episode titled \"The Final Blow\" (also known as Air Crash Investigation as the episode titled \"Crashed and Missing\" or \"Doomed to Fail\" (S09E07)). It is also featured in season 2, episode 5, of the TV show Why Planes Crash , in an episode called \"Sudden Impact\".

James Carter Van Horne (August 6, 1935 \u2013 September 1, 2025) was an American economist and finance academic. He was the A. P. Giannini Professor of Banking and Finance at the Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB). He authored five books, more than 60 articles, and numerous case studies. His teaching and research covered corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions , corporate restructuring, money and capital markets, and fixed-income securities. Early life and education Van Horne was born in South Bend, Indiana on August 6, 1935. He completed his bachelor's degree at DePauw University in 1957, followed by master's and doctoral degrees at Northwestern University in 1961 and 1964, respectively. Career In 1965, Van Horne began teaching at Stanford Graduate School of Business. He was promoted to professor and became the school\u2019s first faculty director of the MBA program (1970\u201373). He twice served as associate dean of academic affairs during the 1970s and later headed the finance group, helping to build it into one of the leading academic finance groups worldwide. He served as president of the Western Finance Association from 1981 to 1982, and was the 1984 president of the American Finance Association. He retired from Stanford in 2007 after 42 years on the faculty. He also served on federal and California state commissions and advisory groups, and sat on several corporate and nonprofit boards. Teaching and influence Over the course of his career, Van Horne taught between 7,000 and 8,000 students. He was known as an \u201cold school\u201d professor: he addressed students formally, was famous for cold-calling, and pressed students to justify every detail of their decisions. His advanced course Topics in Corporate Finance was structured as a quasi-seminar with case discussions, focusing on capital structure , distribution policy, mergers and acquisitions, and corporate restructuring. His Corporate Finance course was described in obituaries as \u201clegendary\u201d for its rigor and case-based approach, and he was noted for his commitment to mentoring students. Research and commentary Van Horne\u2019s research addressed the theory and behavior of interest rates, capital budgeting decisions, corporate finance, valuation, the term structure of interest rates, the effects of inflation, and financial innovation. He authored widely used textbooks, including Fundamentals of Financial Management and Financial Management and Policy. The latter, first published in 1968, was among the first textbooks to integrate modern finance with corporate decision-making, and it remained in global use for four decades. He has been described as \u201cthe father of modern corporate finance MBA teaching.\u201d In public commentary during the Enron scandal , he warned against misleading accounting practices, calling Enron\u2019s collapse \u201cthe neutron bomb of accounting.\u201d He criticized pro forma earnings, revenue recognition abuses, and use of special-purpose entities, and urged investors to focus on balance sheets and operating cash cycles. Death Van Horne died in Palo Alto, California on September 1, 2025, at the age of 90. He was survived by his wife of 65 years, Mimi, their three sons, Drew, Stuart, and Steve, and several grandchildren. Awards and honors In 1982, he received the school's inaugural MBA Distinguished Teaching Award, and in 1997, he became the first two-time recipient. He was the 1998 recipient of the Robert T. Davis Award for extraordinary faculty contributions. In 2011, the GSB established the James C. Van Horne Professorship in his honor; the named professorship was first held by Jeffrey Zwiebel . He was also elected a Fellow of the American Finance Association. Selected publications Van Horne, James (2000). Fundamentals of Financial Management (11th ed.). Prentice Hall. ISBN 013090533X.

{"id": "doc_random_069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasound", "text": "This article is about imaging the human body. For imaging of animals in research, see Preclinical imaging . For therapeutic use of ultrasound, see Therapeutic ultrasound . \"Echography\" and \"Echograph\" redirect here. Not to be confused with Echo sounding . Medical ultrasound includes diagnostic techniques (mainly imaging ) using ultrasound , as well as therapeutic applications of ultrasound. In diagnosis, it is used to create an image of internal body structures such as tendons , muscles , joints, blood vessels, and internal organs, to measure some characteristics (e.g., distances and velocities) or to generate an informative audible sound. The usage of ultrasound to produce visual images for medicine is called medical ultrasonography or simply sonography . Sonography using ultrasound reflection is called echography . There are also transmission methods, such as ultrasound transmission tomography . The practice of examining pregnant women using ultrasound is called obstetric ultrasonography , and was an early development of clinical ultrasonography. The machine used is called an ultrasound machine , a sonograph or an echograph . The visual image formed using this technique is called an ultrasonogram , a sonogram or an echogram . Ultrasound of carotid artery Ultrasound is composed of sound waves with frequencies greater than 20,000\u00a0 Hz , which is the approximate upper threshold of human hearing. Ultrasonic images, also known as sonograms, are created by sending pulses of ultrasound into tissue using a probe . The ultrasound pulses echo off tissues with different reflection properties and are returned to the probe which records and displays them as an image. A general-purpose ultrasonic transducer may be used for most imaging purposes but some situations may require the use of a specialized transducer. Most ultrasound examination is done using a transducer on the surface of the body, but improved visualization is often possible if a transducer can be placed inside the body. For this purpose, special-use transducers, including transvaginal , endorectal, and transesophageal transducers are commonly employed. At the extreme, very small transducers can be mounted on small diameter catheters and placed within blood vessels to image the walls and disease of those vessels. Types Mode The imaging mode refers to probe and machine settings that result in specific dimensions of the ultrasound image. Several modes of ultrasound are used in medical imaging: A-mode : Amplitude mode refers to the mode in which the amplitude of the transducer voltage is recorded as a function of two-way travel time of an ultrasound pulse. A single pulse is transmitted through the body and scatters back to the same transducer element. The voltage amplitudes recorded correlate linearly to acoustic pressure amplitudes. A-mode is one-dimensional. B-mode : In brightness mode, an array of transducer elements scans a plane through the body resulting in a two-dimensional image. Each pixel value of the image correlates to voltage amplitude registered from the backscattered signal. The dimensions of B-mode images are voltage as a function of angle and two-way time. M-mode : In motion mode, A-mode pulses are emitted in succession. The backscattered signal is converted to lines of bright pixels, whose brightness linearly correlates to backscattered voltage amplitudes. Each next line is plotted adjacent to the previous, resulting in an image that looks like a B-mode image. The M-mode image dimensions are however voltage as a function of two-way time and recording time. This mode is an ultrasound analogy to streak video recording in high-speed photography. As moving tissue transitions produce backscattering, this can be used to determine the displacement of specific organ structures, most commonly the heart. Most machines convert two-way time to imaging depth using as assumed speed of sound of 1540\u00a0m/s. As the actual speed of sound varies greatly in different tissue types, an ultrasound image is therefore not a true tomographic representation of the body. 3D imaging Three-dimensional imaging is done by combining B-mode images, using dedicated rotating or stationary probes. This has been referred to as C-mode . A hybrid rotating ultrasound/ photoacoustic system produces 3D images, including blood and tissue without the use of magnets or ionizing radiation. It uses an arc of detectors to create a volumetric image. A laser pulse causes hemoglobin molecules to vibrate and generate acoustic signal also absorbed by the detectors. Technique An imaging technique is the method of signal generation and processing that supports in a specific application. Most techniques use B-mode. Doppler sonography : This imaging technique makes use of the Doppler effect in detection and measuring moving targets, typically blood. Harmonic imaging : backscattered signal from tissue is filtered to comprise only frequency content of at least twice the centre frequency of the transmitted ultrasound. Harmonic imaging used for perfusion detection when using ultrasound contrast agents and for the detection of tissue harmonics. Common pulse schemes for the creation of harmonic response without the need of real-time Fourier analysis are pulse inversion and power modulation. B-flow image of venous reflux . B-flow is an imaging technique that digitally highlights moving reflectors (mainly red blood cells ) while suppressing the signals from the surrounding stationary tissue. It aims to visualize flowing blood and surrounding stationary tissues simultaneously. It is thus an alternative or complement to Doppler ultrasonography in visualizing blood flow. Therapeutic ultrasound aimed at a specific tumor or calculus is not an imaging mode. However, for positioning a treatment probe to focus on a specific region of interest, A-mode and B-mode are typically used, often during treatment. Advantages and drawbacks Compared to other medical imaging modalities, ultrasound has several advantages. It provides images in real-time, is portable , and can consequently be brought to the bedside. It is substantially lower in cost than other imaging strategies. Drawbacks include various limits on its field of view, the need for patient cooperation, dependence on patient physique, difficulty imaging structures obscured by bone , air or gases, and the necessity of a skilled operator, usually with professional training. Uses Urinary bladder (black butterfly-like shape) and hyperplastic prostate (BPH) visualized by medical ultrasound Sonography (ultrasonography) is widely used in medicine . It is possible to perform both diagnosis and therapeutic procedures , using ultrasound to guide interventional procedures such as biopsies or to drain collections of fluid, which can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Sonographers are medical professionals who perform scans which are traditionally interpreted by radiologists, physicians who specialize in the application and interpretation of medical imaging modalities, or by cardiologists in the case of cardiac ultrasonography ( echocardiography ). Sonography is effective for imaging soft tissues of the body. Superficial structures such as muscle , tendon , testis , breast , thyroid and parathyroid glands, and the neonatal brain are imaged at higher frequencies (7\u201318\u00a0MHz), which provide better linear (axial) and horizontal (lateral) resolution . Deeper structures such as liver and kidney are imaged at lower frequencies (1\u20136\u00a0MHz) with lower axial and lateral resolution as a price of deeper tissue penetration. Anesthesiology In anesthesiology , ultrasound is commonly used to guide the placement of needles when injecting local anesthetic solutions in the proximity of nerves identified within the ultrasound image (nerve block). It is also used for vascular access such as cannulation of large central veins and for difficult arterial cannulation . Transcranial Doppler is frequently used by neuro-anesthesiologists for obtaining information about flow-velocity in the basal cerebral vessels . Angiology (vascular) Intravascular ultrasound image of a coronary artery (left), with color-coding on the right, delineating the lumen (yellow), external elastic membrane (blue) and the atherosclerotic plaque burden (green) Further information: Doppler ultrasonography and Intravascular ultrasound In angiology or vascular medicine, duplex ultrasound (B Mode imaging combined with Doppler flow measurement) is used to diagnose arterial and venous disease. This is particularly important in potential neurologic problems , where carotid ultrasound is commonly used for assessing blood flow and potential or suspected stenosis in the carotid arteries , while transcranial Doppler is used for imaging flow in the intracerebral arteries. Intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) uses a specially designed catheter with a miniaturized ultrasound probe attached to its distal end, which is then threaded inside a blood vessel. The proximal end of the catheter is attached to computerized ultrasound equipment and allows the application of ultrasound technology, such as a piezoelectric transducer or capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer , to visualize the endothelium of blood vessels in living individuals. In the case of the common and potentially, serious problem of blood clots in the deep veins of the leg, ultrasound plays a key diagnostic role, while ultrasonography of chronic venous insufficiency of the legs focuses on more superficial veins to assist with planning of suitable interventions to relieve symptoms or improve cosmetics. Cardiology (heart) Main article: Echocardiography Ultrasound of human heart showing the four chambers and mitral and tricuspid valves Echocardiography is an essential tool in cardiology , assisting in evaluation of heart valve function, such as stenosis or insufficiency , strength of cardiac muscle contraction, and hypertrophy or dilatation of the main chambers. ( ventricle and atrium ) Emergency medicine Main article: Emergency ultrasound Point of care ultrasound has many applications in emergency medicine . These include differentiating cardiac from pulmonary causes of acute breathlessness , and the Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam , extended to include assessment for significant hemoperitoneum or pericardial tamponade after trauma ( EFAST ). Other uses include assisting with differentiating causes of abdominal pain such as gallstones and kidney stones . Emergency Medicine Residency Programs have a substantial history of promoting the use of bedside ultrasound during physician training. Gastroenterology/Colorectal surgery Further information: Abdominal ultrasonography and Endoanal ultrasound Both abdominal and endoanal ultrasound are frequently used in gastroenterology and colorectal surgery . In abdominal sonography, the major organs of the abdomen such as the pancreas , aorta , inferior vena cava , liver , gall bladder , bile ducts , kidneys , and spleen may be imaged. However, sound waves may be blocked by gas in the bowel and attenuated to differing degrees by fat, sometimes limiting diagnostic capabilities. The appendix can sometimes be seen when inflamed (e.g.: appendicitis ) and ultrasound is the initial imaging choice, avoiding radiation if possible, although it frequently needs to be followed by other imaging methods such as CT . Endoanal ultrasound is used particularly in the investigation of anorectal symptoms such as fecal incontinence or obstructed defecation . It images the immediate perianal anatomy and is able to detect occult defects such as tearing of the anal sphincter . Hepatology Ultrasonography of liver tumors allows for both detection and characterization. Ultrasound imaging studies are often obtained during the evaluation process of Fatty liver disease . Ultrasonography reveals a \"bright\" liver with increased echogenicity. Pocket-sized ultrasound devices might be used as point-of-care screening tools to diagnose liver steatosis. Gynecology and obstetrics Main articles: Gynecologic ultrasonography and Obstetric ultrasonography Orthogonal planes of a three-dimensional sonographic volume with transverse and coronal measurements for estimating fetal cranial volume Gynecologic ultrasonography examines female pelvic organs (specifically the uterus , ovaries , and fallopian tubes ) as well as the bladder , adnexa , and pouch of Douglas . It uses transducers designed for approaches through the lower abdominal wall, curvilinear and sector, and specialty transducers such as transvaginal ultrasound . Obstetrical sonography was originally developed in the late 1950s and 1960s by Sir Ian Donald and is commonly used during pregnancy to check the development and presentation of the fetus . It can be used to identify many conditions that could be potentially harmful to the mother and/or baby possibly remaining undiagnosed or with delayed diagnosis in the absence of sonography. It is currently believed that the risk of delayed diagnosis is greater than the small risk, if any, associated with undergoing an ultrasound scan. However, its use for non-medical purposes such as fetal \"keepsake\" videos and photos is discouraged. Obstetric ultrasound is primarily used to: Date the pregnancy ( gestational age ) Confirm fetal viability Determine location of fetus , intrauterine vs ectopic Check the location of the placenta in relation to the cervix Check for the number of fetuses ( multiple pregnancy ) Check for major physical abnormalities. Assess fetal growth (for evidence of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)) Check for fetal movement and heartbeat. Determine the sex of the baby According to the European Committee of Medical Ultrasound Safety (ECMUS) Ultrasonic examinations should only be performed by competent personnel who are trained and updated in safety matters. Ultrasound produces heating, pressure changes and mechanical disturbances in tissue. Diagnostic levels of ultrasound can produce temperature rises that are hazardous to sensitive organs and the embryo/fetus. Biological effects of non-thermal origin have been reported in animals but, to date, no such effects have been demonstrated in humans, except when a micro-bubble contrast agent is present. Nonetheless, care should be taken to use low power settings and avoid pulsed wave scanning of the fetal brain unless specifically indicated in high risk pregnancies. Figures released for the period 2005\u20132006 by the UK Government (Department of Health) show that non-obstetric ultrasound examinations constituted more than 65% of the total number of ultrasound scans conducted. Hemodynamics (blood circulation) Blood velocity can be measured in various blood vessels, such as middle cerebral artery or descending aorta , by relatively inexpensive and low risk ultrasound Doppler probes attached to portable monitors. These provide non-invasive or transcutaneous (non-piercing) minimal invasive blood flow assessment. Common examples are transcranial Doppler , esophageal Doppler and suprasternal Doppler . Otolaryngology (head and neck) Neck ultrasound Most structures of the neck, including the thyroid and parathyroid glands , lymph nodes , and salivary glands , are well-visualized by high-frequency ultrasound with exceptional anatomic detail. Ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for thyroid tumors and lesions, and its use is important in the evaluation, preoperative planning, and postoperative surveillance of patients with thyroid cancer . Many other benign and malignant conditions in the head and neck can be differentiated, evaluated, and managed with the help of diagnostic ultrasound and ultrasound-guided procedures. Neonatology In neonatology , transcranial Doppler can be used for basic assessment of intracerebral structural abnormalities, suspected hemorrhage, ventriculomegaly or hydrocephalus and anoxic insults ( periventricular leukomalacia ). It can be performed through the soft spots in the skull of a newborn infant ( Fontanelle ) until these completely close at about 1 year of age by which time they have formed a virtually impenetrable acoustic barrier to ultrasound. The most common site for cranial ultrasound is the anterior fontanelle. The smaller the fontanelle, the more the image is compromised. Lung ultrasound has been found to be useful in diagnosing common neonatal respiratory diseases such as transient tachypnea of the newborn, respiratory distress syndrome, congenital pneumonia, meconium aspiration syndrome, and pneumothorax. A neonatal lung ultrasound score, first described by Brat et al., has been found to highly correlate with oxygenation in the newborn. Ophthalmology ( eyes ) In ophthalmology and optometry , there are two major forms of eye exam using ultrasound: A-scan ultrasound biometry , is commonly referred to as an A-scan ( amplitude scan ). A-mode provides data on the length of the eye , which is a major determinant in common sight disorders , especially for determining the power of an intraocular lens after cataract extraction. B-scan ultrasonography , or B-scan-Brightness scan , is a B-mode scan that produces a cross-sectional view of the eye and the orbit . It is an essential tool in ophthalmology for diagnosing and managing a wide array of conditions affecting the posterior segment of the eye.It is non invasive and uses frequency 10\u201315\u00a0MHz. It is often used in conjunction with other imaging techniques (like OCT or fluorescein angiography) for a more comprehensive evaluation of ocular conditions. Pulmonology (lungs) Ultrasound is used to assess the lungs in a variety of settings including critical care, emergency medicine, trauma surgery, as well as general medicine and nursing. This imaging modality is used at the bedside or examination table to evaluate a number of different lung abnormalities as to guide respiratory therapy and mechanical ventilation , and procedures such as thoracentesis , (drainage of pleural fluid (effusion)), needle aspiration biopsy, and catheter placement. Although air present in the lungs does not allow good penetration of ultrasound waves, interpretation of specific artifacts created on the lung surface can be used to detect abnormalities. Lung, or pulmonary ultrasound does not visualise the lung itself, but the tissue-air-interface at the pleural line. The fact that artefact interpretation is essential sets lung ultrasound apart from modalities aimed at imaging an actual organ. This distinction has mechanical implications that are important when trying to interpret artifactual patterns. Where modern sonography is aided by software filters and acoustic harmonics to enhance visualisation of organs such as the heart or liver, they corrupt the specific patterns sought in lung ultrasound. Therefore, a software preset void of imaging filters, harmonic imaging, and beam compounding, is preferred. Lung ultrasound basics The Normal Lung Surface: The lung surface is composed of visceral and parietal pleura . These two surfaces are typically pushed together and make up the pleural line, which is the basis of lung (or pleural) ultrasound. This line is visible less than a centimeter below the rib line in most adults. On ultrasound, it is visualized as a hyperechoic (bright white) horizontal line if the ultrasound probe is applied perpendicularly to the skin. Artifacts: Lung ultrasound relies on artifacts, which would otherwise be considered a hindrance in imaging. Air blocks the ultrasound beam and thus visualizing healthy lung tissue itself with this mode of imaging is not practical. Consequently, physicians and sonographers have learned to recognize patterns that ultrasound beams create when imaging healthy versus diseased lung tissue. Three commonly seen and utilized artifacts in lung ultrasound include lung sliding, A-lines, and B-lines. \u00a7 Lung Sliding: The presence of lung sliding, which indicates the shimmering of the pleural line that occurs with movement of the visceral and parietal pleura against one another with respiration (sometimes described as 'ants marching'), is the most important finding in normal aerated lung. Lung sliding indicates both that the lung is present at the chest wall and that the lung is functioning. \u00a7 A-lines: When the ultrasound beam makes contact with the pleural line , it is reflected back creating a bright white horizontal line. The subsequent reverberation artifacts that appear as equally spaced horizontal lines deep to the pleura are A-lines. Ultimately, A-lines are a reflection of the ultrasound beam from the pleura with the space between A-lines corresponding to the distance between the parietal pleura and the skin surface. A-lines indicate the presence of air, which means that these artifacts can be present in normal healthy lung (and also in patients with pneumothorax). \u00a7 B-lines: B-lines are also reverberation artifacts. They are visualized as hyperechoic vertical lines extending from the pleura to the edge of the ultrasound screen. These lines are sharply defined and laser-like and typically do not fade as they progress down the screen. A few B-lines that move along with the sliding pleura can be seen in normal lung due to acoustic impedance differences between water and air. However, excessive B-lines (three or more) are abnormal and are typically indicative of underlying lung pathology. Lung pathology assessed with ultrasound Pulmonary edema : Lung ultrasound has been shown to be very sensitive for the detection of pulmonary edema. It allows for improvement in diagnosis and management of critically ill patients, particularly when used in combination with echocardiography. The sonographic feature that is present in pulmonary edema is multiple B-lines. B-lines can occur in a healthy lung; however, the presence of 3 or more in the anterior or lateral lung regions is always abnormal. In pulmonary edema, B-lines indicate an increase in the amount of water contained in the lungs outside of the pulmonary vasculature. B-lines can also be present in a number of other conditions including pneumonia, pulmonary contusion, and lung infarction. Additionally, it is important to note that there are multiple types of interactions between the pleural surface and the ultrasound wave that can generate artifacts with some similarity to B-lines but which do not have pathologic significance. Atelectasis : Consolidations are, as opposed to artifactual patterns, directly visualised on lung ultrasound. Differentiation of consolidations within the lung can be made with qualitative methods such as the presence of dynamic, or static air bronchograms, being air trapped within smaller airways inside of consolidations. Pathognomic changes in resorptive and compressive atelectasis , respectively can thus be distinguished. Pneumothorax : In clinical settings when pneumothorax is suspected, lung ultrasound can aid in diagnosis. In pneumothorax, air is present between the two layers of the pleura and lung sliding on ultrasound is therefore absent. The negative predictive value for lung sliding on ultrasound is reported as 99.2\u2013100%\u00a0\u2013 briefly, if lung sliding is present, a pneumothorax is effectively ruled out. The absence of lung sliding, however, is not necessarily specific for pneumothorax as there are other conditions that also cause this finding including acute respiratory distress syndrome , lung consolidations , pleural adhesions, and pulmonary fibrosis . Pleural effusion : Lung ultrasound is a cost-effective, safe, and non-invasive imaging method that can aid in the prompt visualization and diagnosis of pleural effusions. Effusions can be diagnosed by a combination of physical exam, percussion, and auscultation of the chest. However, these exam techniques can be complicated by a variety of factors including the presence of mechanical ventilation , obesity, or patient positioning, all of which reduce the sensitivity of the physical exam. Consequently, lung ultrasound can be an additional tool to augment plain chest Xray and chest CT . Pleural effusions on ultrasound appear as structural images within the thorax rather than an artifact. They will typically have four distinct borders including the pleural line, two rib shadows, and a deep border. In critically ill patients with pleural effusion, ultrasound may guide procedures including needle insertion, thoracentesis , and chest-tube insertion . Lung cancer staging: In pulmonology , endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) probes are applied to standard flexible endoscopic probes and used by pulmonologists to allow for direct visualization of endobronchial lesions and lymph nodes prior to transbronchial needle aspiration. Among its many uses, EBUS aids in lung cancer staging by allowing for lymph node sampling without the need for major surgery. COVID-19 : Lung ultrasound has proved useful in the diagnosis of COVID-19 especially in cases where other investigations are not available. Urinary tract Main article: Urinary tract ultrasound Urinary bladder (black butterfly-like shape) and hyperplastic prostate ( BPH ) visualized by medical sonographic technique Ultrasound is routinely used in urology to determine the amount of fluid retained in a patient's bladder. In a pelvic sonogram, images include the uterus and ovaries or urinary bladder in females. In males, a sonogram will provide information about the bladder, prostate , or testicles (for example to urgently distinguish epididymitis from testicular torsion ). In young males, it is used to distinguish more benign testicular masses ( varicocele or hydrocele ) from testicular cancer , which is curable but must be treated to preserve health and fertility. There are two methods of performing pelvic sonography \u2013 externally or internally. The internal pelvic sonogram is performed either trans vaginally (in a woman) or transrectally (in a man). Sonographic imaging of the pelvic floor can produce important diagnostic information regarding the precise relationship of abnormal structures with other pelvic organs and it represents a useful hint to treat patients with symptoms related to pelvic prolapse, double incontinence and obstructed defecation. It is also used to diagnose and, at higher frequencies, to treat (break up) kidney stones or kidney crystals ( nephrolithiasis ). Penis and scrotum Main articles: Scrotal ultrasound and Penile ultrasonography Scrotal ultrasonography is used in the evaluation of testicular pain , and can help identify solid masses. Ultrasound is an excellent method for the study of the penis , such as indicated in trauma, priapism, erectile dysfunction or suspected Peyronie's disease . Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal ultrasound is used to examine tendons, muscles, nerves, ligaments, soft tissue masses, and bone surfaces. It is helpful in diagnosing ligament sprains, muscles strains and joint pathology. It is an alternative or supplement to x-ray imaging in detecting fractures of the wrist, elbow and shoulder for patients up to 12 years ( Fracture sonography ). Quantitative ultrasound is an adjunct musculoskeletal test for myopathic disease in children; estimates of lean body mass in adults; proxy measures of muscle quality (i.e., tissue composition) in older adults with sarcopenia Ultrasound can also be used for needle guidance in muscle or joint injections , as in ultrasound-guided hip joint injection . Kidneys Main article: Renal ultrasonography In nephrology , ultrasonography of the kidneys is essential in the diagnosis and management of kidney-related diseases. The kidneys are easily examined, and most pathological changes are distinguishable with ultrasound. It is an accessible, versatile, relatively economic, and fast aid for decision-making in patients with renal symptoms and for guidance in renal intervention. Using B-mode imaging , assessment of renal anatomy is easily performed, and US is often used as image guidance for renal interventions. Furthermore, novel applications in renal US have been introduced with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), elastography and fusion imaging. However, renal US has certain limitations, and other modalities, such as CT (CECT) and MRI, should be considered for supplementary imaging in assessing renal disease. Venous access Intravenous access, for the collection of blood samples to assist in diagnosis or laboratory investigation including blood culture, or for administration of intravenous fluids for fluid maintenance of replacement or blood transfusion in sicker patients, is a common medical procedure. The need for intravenous access occurs in the outpatient laboratory, in the inpatient hospital units, and most critically in the Emergency Room and Intensive Care Unit. In many situations, intravenous access may be required repeatedly or over a significant time period. In these latter circumstances, a needle with an overlying catheter is introduced into the vein and the catheter is then inserted securely into the vein while the needle is withdrawn. The chosen veins are most frequently selected from the arm, but in challenging situations, a deeper vein from the neck ( external jugular vein ) or upper arm ( subclavian vein ) may need to be used. There are many reasons why the selection of a suitable vein may be problematic. These include, but are not limited to, obesity, previous injury to veins from inflammatory reaction to previous 'blood draws', previous injury to veins from recreational drug use. In these challenging situations, the insertion of a catheter into a vein has been greatly assisted by the use of ultrasound. The ultrasound unit may be 'cart-based' or 'handheld' using a linear transducer with a frequency of 10 to 15 megahertz . In most circumstances, choice of vein will be limited by the requirement that the vein is within 1.5 cms. from the skin surface. The transducer may be placed longitudinally or transversely over the chosen vein. Ultrasound training for intravenous cannulation is offered in most ultrasound training programs. Mechanism The creation of an image from sound has three steps \u2013 transmitting a sound wave , receiving echoes , and interpreting those echoes. Producing a sound wave A modern medical ultrasound scanner A sound wave is typically produced by a piezoelectric transducer encased in a plastic housing. Strong, short electrical pulses from the ultrasound machine drive the transducer at the desired frequency. The frequencies can vary between 1 and 18 MHz , though frequencies up to 50\u2013100 megahertz have been used experimentally in a technique known as biomicroscopy in special regions, such as the anterior chamber of the eye. Older technology transducers focused their beam with physical lenses. Contemporary technology transducers use digital antenna array techniques (piezoelectric elements in the transducer produce echoes at different times) to enable the ultrasound machine to change the direction and depth of focus. Near the transducer, the width of the ultrasound beam almost equals to the width of the transducer, after reaching a distance from the transducer (near zone length or Fresnel zone ), the beam width narrows to half of the transducer width, and after that the width increases (far zone length or Fraunhofer's zone ), where the lateral resolution decreases. Therefore, the wider the transducer width and the higher the frequency of ultrasound, the longer the Fresnel zone, and the lateral resolution can be maintained at a greater depth from the transducer. Ultrasound waves travel in pulses. Therefore, a shorter pulse length requires higher bandwidth (greater number of frequencies) to constitute the ultrasound pulse. As stated, the sound is focused either by the shape of the transducer, a lens in front of the transducer, or a complex set of control pulses from the ultrasound scanner, in the beamforming or spatial filtering technique. This focusing produces an arc-shaped sound wave from the face of the transducer. The wave travels into the body and comes into focus at a desired depth. Materials on the face of the transducer enable the sound to be transmitted efficiently into the body (often a rubbery coating, a form of impedance matching ). In addition, a water-based gel is placed between the patient's skin and the probe to facilitate ultrasound transmission into the body. This is because air causes total reflection of ultrasound; impeding the transmission of ultrasound into the body. The sound wave is partially reflected from the layers between different tissues or scattered from smaller structures. Specifically, sound is reflected anywhere where there are acoustic impedance changes in the body: e.g. blood cells in blood plasma , small structures in organs, etc. Some of the reflections return to the transducer. Receiving the echoes The return of the sound wave to the transducer results in the same process as sending the sound wave, in reverse. The returned sound wave vibrates the transducer and the transducer turns the vibrations into electrical pulses that travel to the ultrasonic scanner where they are processed and transformed into a digital image. Forming the image To make an image, the ultrasound scanner must determine two characteristics from each received echo: How long it took the echo to be received from when the sound was transmitted. (Time and distance are equivalent.) How strong the echo was. Once the ultrasonic scanner determines these two, it can locate which pixel in the image to illuminate and with what intensity. Transforming the received signal into a digital image may be explained by using a blank spreadsheet as an analogy. First picture a long, flat transducer at the top of the sheet. Send pulses down the 'columns' of the spreadsheet (A, B, C, etc.). Listen at each column for any return echoes. When an echo is heard, note how long it took for the echo to return. The longer the wait, the deeper the row (1,2,3, etc.). The strength of the echo determines the brightness setting for that cell (white for a strong echo, black for a weak echo, and varying shades of grey for everything in between.) When all the echoes are recorded on the sheet, a greyscale image has been accomplished. In modern ultrasound systems, images are derived from the combined reception of echoes by multiple elements, rather than a single one. These elements in the transducer array work together to receive signals, a process essential for optimizing the ultrasonic beam's focus and producing detailed images. One predominant method for this is \"delay-and-sum\" beamforming. The time delay applied to each element is calculated based on the geometrical relationship between the imaging point, the transducer, and receiver positions. By integrating these time-adjusted signals, the system pinpoints focus onto specific tissue regions, enhancing image resolution and clarity. The utilization of multiple element reception combined with the delay-and-sum principles underpins the high-quality images characteristic of contemporary ultrasound scans. Displaying the image Images from the ultrasound scanner are transferred and displayed using the DICOM standard. Normally, very little post processing is applied. Sound in the body Curvilinear array transducer Ultrasonography ( sonography ) uses a probe containing multiple acoustic transducers to send pulses of sound into a material. Whenever a sound wave encounters a material with a different density (acoustical impedance), some of the sound wave is scattered but part is reflected back to the probe and is detected as an echo. The time it takes for the echo to travel back to the probe is measured and used to calculate the depth of the tissue interface causing the echo. The greater the difference between acoustic impedances, the larger the echo is. If the pulse hits gases or solids, the density difference is so great that most of the acoustic energy is reflected and it becomes impossible to progress further. The frequencies used for medical imaging are generally in the range of 1 to 18\u00a0MHz Higher frequencies have a correspondingly smaller wavelength, and can be used to make more detailed sonograms. However, the attenuation of the sound wave is increased at higher frequencies, so penetration of deeper tissues necessitates a lower frequency (3\u20135\u00a0MHz). Penetrating deep into the body with sonography is difficult. Some acoustic energy is lost each time an echo is formed, but most of it (approximately 0.5 dB cm depth \u22c5 MHz {\\displaystyle \\textstyle 0.5{\\frac {\\mbox{dB}}{{\\mbox{cm depth}}\\cdot {\\mbox{MHz}}}}} ) is lost from acoustic absorption. (See Acoustic attenuation for further details on modeling of acoustic attenuation and absorption.) The speed of sound varies as it travels through different materials, and is dependent on the acoustical impedance of the material. However, the sonographic instrument assumes that the acoustic velocity is constant at 1540\u00a0m/s. An effect of this assumption is that in a real body with non-uniform tissues, the beam becomes somewhat de-focused and image resolution is reduced. To generate a 2-D image, the ultrasonic beam is swept. A transducer may be swept mechanically by rotating or swinging or a 1-D phased array transducer may be used to sweep the beam electronically. The received data is processed and used to construct the image. The image is then a 2-D representation of the slice into the body. 3-D images can be generated by acquiring a series of adjacent 2-D images. Commonly a specialized probe that mechanically scans a conventional 2-D image transducer is used. However, since the mechanical scanning is slow, it is difficult to make 3D images of moving tissues. Recently, 2-D phased array transducers that can sweep the beam in 3-D have been developed. These can image faster and can even be used to make live 3-D images of a beating heart. Doppler ultrasonography is used to study blood flow and muscle motion. The different detected speeds are represented in color for ease of interpretation, for example leaky heart valves: the leak shows up as a flash of unique color. Colors may alternatively be used to represent the amplitudes of the received echoes. Expansions An additional expansion of ultrasound is bi-planar ultrasound , in which the probe has two 2D planes perpendicular to each other, providing more efficient localization and detection. Furthermore, an omniplane probe can rotate 180\u00b0 to obtain multiple images. In 3D ultrasound , many 2D planes are digitally added together to create a 3-dimensional image of the object. Doppler ultrasonography Main article: Doppler ultrasonography Duplex scan of the common carotid artery Doppler ultrasonography employs the Doppler effect to assess whether structures (usually blood) are moving towards or away from the probe, and their relative velocity. By calculating the frequency shift of a particular sample volume, flow in an artery or a jet of blood flow over a heart valve, its speed and direction can be determined and visualized, as an example. Color Doppler is the measurement of velocity by color scale. Color Doppler images are generally combined with gray scale ( B-mode ) images to display duplex ultrasonography images. Uses include: Doppler echocardiography is the use of Doppler ultrasonography to examine the heart . An echocardiogram can, within certain limits, produce accurate assessment of the direction of blood flow and the velocity of blood and cardiac tissue at any arbitrary point using the Doppler effect. Velocity measurements allow assessment of cardiac valve areas and function, abnormal communications between the left and right side of the heart, leaking of blood through the valves ( valvular regurgitation ), and calculation of the cardiac output and E/A ratio (a measure of diastolic dysfunction ). Contrast-enhanced ultrasound using gas-filled microbubble contrast media can be used to improve velocity or other flow-related measurements of interest. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and transcranial color Doppler (TCCD), measure the velocity of blood flow through the brain 's blood vessels through the cranium . They are useful in the diagnosis of emboli , stenosis , vasospasm from a subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding from a ruptured aneurysm ), and other problems. Doppler fetal monitors use the Doppler effect to detect the fetal heartbeat during prenatal care . These are hand-held, and some models also display the heart rate in beats per minute (BPM). Use of this monitor is sometimes known as Doppler auscultation . The Doppler fetal monitor is commonly referred to simply as a Doppler or fetal Doppler and provides information similar to that provided by a fetal stethoscope . Contrast ultrasonography (ultrasound contrast imaging) Main article: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound A contrast medium for medical ultrasonography is a formulation of encapsulated gaseous microbubbles to increase echogenicity of blood, discovered by Dr. Raymond Gramiak in 1968 and named contrast-enhanced ultrasound . This contrast medical imaging modality is used throughout the world, for echocardiography in particular in the United States and for ultrasound radiology in Europe and Asia . Microbubbles-based contrast media is administered intravenously into the patient blood stream during the ultrasonography examination. Due to their size, the microbubbles remain confined in blood vessels without extravasating towards the interstitial fluid . An ultrasound contrast media is therefore purely intravascular, making it an ideal agent to image organ microvasculature for diagnostic purposes. A typical clinical use of contrast ultrasonography is detection of a hypervascular metastatic tumor, which exhibits a contrast uptake (kinetics of microbubbles concentration in blood circulation) faster than healthy biological tissue surrounding the tumor . Other clinical applications using contrast exist, as in echocardiography to improve delineation of left ventricle for visualizing contractibility of heart muscle after a myocardial infarction . Finally, applications in quantitative perfusion (relative measurement of blood flow ) have emerged for identifying early patient response to anti-cancerous drug treatment (methodology and clinical study by Dr. Nathalie Lassau in 2011 ), enabling the best oncological therapeutic options to be determined. Parametric imaging of vascular signatures (diagram) In oncological practice of medical contrast ultrasonography, clinicians use 'parametric imaging of vascular signatures' invented by Dr. Nicolas Rognin in 2010. This method is conceived as a cancer aided diagnostic tool, facilitating characterization of a suspicious tumor ( malignant versus benign ) in an organ. This method is based on medical computational science to analyze a time sequence of ultrasound contrast images, a digital video recorded in real-time during patient examination. Two consecutive signal processing steps are applied to each pixel of the tumor: calculation of a vascular signature (contrast uptake difference with respect to healthy tissue surrounding the tumor); automatic classification of the vascular signature into a unique parameter , the latter coded in one of the four following colors : green for continuous hyper-enhancement (contrast uptake higher than healthy tissue one), blue for continuous hypo-enhancement (contrast uptake lower than healthy tissue one), red for fast hyper-enhancement (contrast uptake before healthy tissue one) or yellow for fast hypo-enhancement (contrast uptake after healthy tissue one). Once signal processing in each pixel is completed, a color spatial map of the parameter is displayed on a computer monitor , summarizing all vascular information of the tumor in a single image called a parametric image (see last figure of press article as clinical examples). This parametric image is interpreted by clinicians based on predominant colorization of the tumor: red indicates a suspicion of malignancy (risk of cancer), green or yellow \u2013 a high probability of benignity. In the first case (suspicion of malignant tumor ), the clinician typically prescribes a biopsy to confirm the diagnostic or a CT scan examination as a second opinion. In the second case (quasi-certain of benign tumor ), only a follow-up is needed with a contrast ultrasonography examination a few months later. The main clinical benefits are to avoid a systemic biopsy (with inherent risks of invasive procedures) of benign tumors or a CT scan examination exposing the patient to X-ray radiation. The parametric imaging of vascular signatures method proved to be effective in humans for characterization of tumors in the liver. In a cancer screening context, this method might be potentially applicable to other organs such as breast or prostate . Molecular ultrasonography (ultrasound molecular imaging) The current future of contrast ultrasonography is in molecular imaging with potential clinical applications expected in cancer screening to detect malignant tumors at their earliest stage of appearance. Molecular ultrasonography (or ultrasound molecular imaging) uses targeted microbubbles originally designed by Dr Alexander Klibanov in 1997; such targeted microbubbles specifically bind or adhere to tumoral microvessels by targeting biomolecular cancer expression (overexpression of certain biomolecules that occurs during neo-angiogenesis or inflammation in malignant tumors). As a result, a few minutes after their injection in blood circulation, the targeted microbubbles accumulate in the malignant tumor; facilitating its localization in a unique ultrasound contrast image. In 2013, the very first exploratory clinical trial in humans for prostate cancer was completed at Amsterdam in the Netherlands by Dr. Hessel Wijkstra. In molecular ultrasonography, the technique of acoustic radiation force (also used for shear wave elastography ) is applied in order to literally push the targeted microbubbles towards microvessels wall; first demonstrated by Dr. Paul Dayton in 1999. This allows maximization of binding to the malignant tumor; the targeted microbubbles being in more direct contact with cancerous biomolecules expressed at the inner surface of tumoral microvessels. At the stage of scientific preclinical research, the technique of acoustic radiation force was implemented as a prototype in clinical ultrasound systems and validated in vivo in 2D and 3D imaging modes. Elastography (ultrasound elasticity imaging) Main article: Elastography Ultrasound is also used for elastography, which is a relatively new imaging modality that maps the elastic properties of soft tissue. This modality emerged in the last two decades. Elastography is useful in medical diagnoses as it can discern healthy from unhealthy tissue for specific organs/growths. For example, cancerous tumors will often be harder than the surrounding tissue, and diseased livers are stiffer than healthy ones. There are many ultrasound elastography techniques. Interventional ultrasonography Interventional ultrasonography involves biopsy , emptying fluids, intrauterine Blood transfusion ( Hemolytic disease of the newborn ). Thyroid cysts : High frequency thyroid ultrasound (HFUS) can be used to treat several gland conditions. The recurrent thyroid cyst that was usually treated in the past with surgery, can be treated effectively by a new procedure called percutaneous ethanol injection, or PEI. With ultrasound guided placement of a 25 gauge needle within the cyst, and after evacuation of the cyst fluid, about 50% of the cyst volume is injected back into the cavity, under strict operator visualization of the needle tip. The procedure is 80% successful in reducing the cyst to minute size. Metastatic thyroid cancer neck lymph nodes: HFUS may also be used to treat metastatic thyroid cancer neck lymph nodes that occur in patients who either refuse, or are no longer candidates, for surgery. Small amounts of ethanol are injected under ultrasound guided needle placement. A power doppler blood flow study is done prior to injection. The blood flow can be destroyed and the node rendered inactive. Power doppler visualized blood flow can be eradicated, and there may be a drop in the cancer blood marker test, thyroglobulin , TG, as the node become non-functional. Another interventional use for HFUS is to mark a cancer node prior to surgery to help locate the node cluster at the surgery. A minute amount of methylene dye is injected, under careful ultrasound guided placement of the needle on the anterior surface, but not in the node. The dye will be evident to the thyroid surgeon when opening the neck. A similar localization procedure with methylene blue, can be done to locate parathyroid adenomas. Joint injections can be guided by medical ultrasound, such as in ultrasound-guided hip joint injections . Compression ultrasonography Compression ultrasonography is when the probe is pressed against the skin. This can bring the target structure closer to the probe, increasing spatial resolution of it. Comparison of the shape of the target structure before and after compression can aid in diagnosis. It is used in ultrasonography of deep venous thrombosis , wherein absence of vein compressibility is a strong indicator of thrombosis. Compression ultrasonography has both high sensitivity and specificity for detecting proximal deep vein thrombosis in symptomatic patients. Results are not reliable when the patient is asymptomatic, for example in high risk postoperative orthopedic patients. A normal appendix without and with compression. Absence of compressibility indicates appendicitis . Compression is used in this ultrasonograph to get closer to the abdominal aorta , making the superior mesenteric vein and the inferior vena cava look rather flat. Panoramic ultrasonography Panoramic ultrasonography of a proximal biceps tendon rupture . Top image shows the contralateral normal side, and lower image shows a retracted muscle, with a hematoma filling out the proximal space. Panoramic ultrasonography is the digital stitching of multiple ultrasound images into a broader one. It can display an entire abnormality and show its relationship to nearby structures on a single image. Multiparametric ultrasonography Multiparametric ultrasonography (mpUSS) combines multiple ultrasound techniques to produce a composite result. For example, one study combined B-mode, colour Doppler, real-time elastography, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound, achieving an accuracy similar to that of multiparametric MRI . Speed-of-Sound Imaging Speed-of-sound (SoS) imaging aims to find the spatial distribution of the SoS within the tissue. The idea is to find relative delay measurements for different transmission events and solve the limited-angle tomographic reconstruction problem using delay measurements and transmission geometry. Compared to shear-wave elastography, SoS imaging has better ex-vivo tissue differentiation for benign and malignant tumors. Attributes As with all imaging modalities, ultrasonography has positive and negative attributes. Strengths Muscle , soft tissue , and bone surfaces are imaged very well including the delineation of interfaces between solid and fluid-filled spaces. \"Live\" images can be dynamically selected, permitting diagnosis and documentation often rapidly. Live images also permit ultrasound-guided biopsies or injections, which can be cumbersome with other imaging modalities. Organ structure can be demonstrated. There are no known long-term side effects when used according to guidelines, and discomfort is minimal. Ability to image local variations in the mechanical properties of soft tissue. Equipment is widely available and comparatively flexible. Small, easily carried scanners are available which permit bedside examinations. Transducers have become relatively inexpensive compared to other modes of investigation, such as computed X-ray tomography , DEXA or magnetic resonance imaging . Spatial resolution is better in high frequency ultrasound transducers than most other imaging modalities. Use of an ultrasound research interface can offer a relatively inexpensive, real-time, and flexible method for capturing data required for specific research purposes of tissue characterization and development of new image processing techniques. Weaknesses Double aorta artifact in sonography due to difference in velocity of sound waves in muscle and fat Sonographic devices have trouble penetrating bone . For example, sonography of the adult brain is currently very limited. Sonography performs very poorly when there is gas between the transducer and the organ of interest, due to the extreme differences in acoustic impedance . For example, overlying gas in the gastrointestinal tract often makes ultrasound scanning of the pancreas difficult. This is also the case for subcutaneous emphysema when attempting to examine the lungs. Lung imaging however can be useful in demarcating pleural effusions, detecting heart failure and pneumonia. Even in the absence of bone or air, the depth penetration of ultrasound may be limited depending on the frequency of imaging. Consequently, there might be difficulties imaging structures deep in the body, especially in obese patients. Image quality and accuracy of diagnosis is limited with obese patients and overlying subcutaneous fat attenuates the sound beam. A lower frequency transducer is required with subsequent lower resolution. The method is operator-dependent. Skill and experience is needed to acquire good-quality images and make accurate diagnoses. There is no scout image as there is with CT and MRI. Once an image has been acquired there is no exact way to tell which part of the body was imaged. 80% of sonographers experience Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI) or so-called Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSD) because of bad ergonomic positions. Risks and side-effects Ultrasonography is generally considered safe imaging, with the World Health Organization stating: \"Diagnostic ultrasound is recognized as a safe, effective, and highly flexible imaging modality capable of providing clinically relevant information about most parts of the body in a rapid and cost-effective fashion\". Diagnostic ultrasound studies of the fetus are generally considered to be safe during pregnancy. However, this diagnostic procedure should be performed only when there is a valid medical indication, and the lowest possible ultrasonic exposure setting should be used to gain the necessary diagnostic information under the \"as low as reasonably practicable\" or ALARP principle. Although there is no evidence that ultrasound could be harmful to the fetus, medical authorities typically strongly discourage the promotion, selling, or leasing of ultrasound equipment for making \"keepsake fetal videos\". Studies on the safety of ultrasound A meta-analysis of several ultrasonography studies published in 2000 found no statistically significant harmful effects from ultrasonography. It was noted that there is a lack of data on long-term substantive outcomes such as neurodevelopment. A study at the Yale School of Medicine published in 2006 found a small but significant correlation between prolonged and frequent use of ultrasound and abnormal neuronal migration in mice. A study performed in Sweden in 2001 has shown that subtle effects of neurological damage linked to ultrasound were implicated by an increased incidence in left-handedness in boys (a marker for brain problems when not hereditary) and speech delays. The above findings, however, were not confirmed in a follow-up study. A later study, however, performed on a larger sample of 8865 children, has established a statistically significant, albeit weak association of ultrasonography exposure and being non-right handed later in life. Regulation Diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound equipment is regulated in the US by the Food and Drug Administration , and worldwide by other national regulatory agencies. The FDA limits acoustic output using several metrics; generally, other agencies accept the FDA-established guidelines. Currently, New Mexico , Oregon , and North Dakota are the only US states that regulate diagnostic medical sonographers. Certification examinations for sonographers are available in the US from three organizations: the American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography , Cardiovascular Credentialing International and the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists . The primary regulated metrics are Mechanical Index (MI), a metric associated with the cavitation bio-effect, and Thermal Index (TI) a metric associated with the tissue heating bio-effect. The FDA requires that the machine not exceed established limits, which are reasonably conservative in an effort to maintain diagnostic ultrasound as a safe imaging modality. This requires self-regulation on the part of the manufacturer in terms of machine calibration. Ultrasound-based pre-natal care and sex screening technologies were launched in India in the 1980s. With concerns about its misuse for sex-selective abortion , the Government of India passed the Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques Act (PNDT) in 1994 to distinguish and regulate legal and illegal uses of ultrasound equipment. The law was further amended as the Pre-Conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) (PCPNDT) Act in 2004 to deter and punish prenatal sex screening and sex selective abortion. It is currently illegal and a punishable crime in India to determine or disclose the sex of a fetus using ultrasound equipment. Use in other animals Ultrasound is also a valuable tool in veterinary medicine , offering the same non-invasive imaging that helps in the diagnosis and monitoring of conditions in animals. History After the French physicist Pierre Curie 's discovery of piezoelectricity in 1880, ultrasonic waves could be deliberately generated for industry. In 1940, the American acoustical physicist Floyd Firestone devised the first ultrasonic echo imaging device, the Supersonic Reflectoscope, to detect internal flaws in metal castings. In 1941, Austrian neurologist Karl Theo Dussik , in collaboration with his brother, Friedrich, a physicist, was likely the first person to image the human body ultrasonically, outlining the ventricles of a human brain. Ultrasonic energy was first applied to the human body for medical purposes by Dr\u00a0 George Ludwig at the Naval Medical Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland , in the late 1940s. English -born physicist John Wild (1914\u20132009) first used ultrasound to assess the thickness of bowel tissue as early as 1949; he has been described as the \"father of medical ultrasound\". Subsequent advances took place concurrently in several countries but it was not until 1961 that David Robinson and George Kossoff's work at the Australian Department of Health resulted in the first commercially practical water bath ultrasonic scanner. In 1963 Meyerdirk & Wright launched production of the first commercial, hand-held, articulated arm, compound contact B-mode scanner, which made ultrasound generally available for medical use. France L\u00e9andre Pourcelot, a researcher and teacher at INSA ( Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es ), Lyon, co-published a report in 1965 at the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences, \"Effet Doppler et mesure du d\u00e9bit sanguin\" (\"Doppler effect and measure of the blood flow\"), the basis of his design of a Doppler flow meter in 1967. Scotland Parallel developments in Glasgow , Scotland by Professor Ian Donald and colleagues at the Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital (GRMH) led to the first diagnostic applications of the technique. Donald was an obstetrician with a self-confessed \"childish interest in machines, electronic and otherwise\", who, having treated the wife of one of the company's directors, was invited to visit the Research Department of boilermakers Babcock & Wilcox at Renfrew . He adapted their industrial ultrasound equipment to conduct experiments on various anatomical specimens and assess their ultrasonic characteristics. Together with the medical physicist Tom Brown . and fellow obstetrician John MacVicar , Donald refined the equipment to enable differentiation of pathology in live volunteer patients. These findings were reported in The Lancet on 7 June 1958 as \"Investigation of Abdominal Masses by Pulsed Ultrasound\" \u2013 possibly one of the most important papers published in the field of diagnostic medical imaging . At GRMH, Professor Donald and James Willocks then refined their techniques to obstetric applications including fetal head measurement to assess the size and growth of the fetus. With the opening of the new Queen Mother's Hospital in Yorkhill in 1964, it became possible to improve these methods even further. Stuart Campbell 's pioneering work on fetal cephalometry led to it acquiring long-term status as the definitive method of study of foetal growth. As the technical quality of the scans was further developed, it soon became possible to study pregnancy from start to finish and diagnose its many complications such as multiple pregnancy, fetal abnormality and placenta praevia . Diagnostic ultrasound has since been imported into practically every other area of medicine. Sweden Medical ultrasonography was used in 1953 at Lund University by cardiologist Inge Edler and Gustav Ludwig Hertz 's son Carl Hellmuth Hertz , who was then a graduate student at the university's department of nuclear physics . Edler had asked Hertz if it was possible to use radar to look into the body, but Hertz said this was impossible . However, he said, it might be possible to use ultrasonography. Hertz was familiar with using ultrasonic reflectoscopes of the American acoustical physicist Floyd Firestone 's invention for nondestructive materials testing , and together Edler and Hertz developed the idea of applying this methodology in medicine. The first successful measurement of heart activity was made on October 29, 1953, using a device borrowed from the ship construction company Kockums in Malm\u00f6 . On December 16 the same year, the method was applied to generate an echo-encephalogram (ultrasonic probe of the brain ). Edler and Hertz published their findings in 1954. United States In 1962, after about two years of work, Joseph Holmes, William Wright, and Ralph Meyerdirk developed the first compound contact B-mode scanner. Their work had been supported by U.S. Public Health Services and the University of Colorado . Wright and Meyerdirk left the university to form Physionic Engineering Inc., which launched the first commercial hand-held articulated arm compound contact B-mode scanner in 1963. This was the start of the most popular design in the history of ultrasound scanners. In the late 1960s Gene Strandness and the bio-engineering group at the University of Washington conducted research on Doppler ultrasound as a diagnostic tool for vascular disease. Eventually, they developed technologies to use duplex imaging, or Doppler in conjunction with B-mode scanning, to view vascular structures in real time while also providing hemodynamic information. The first demonstration of color Doppler was by Geoff Stevenson, who was involved in the early developments and medical use of Doppler shifted ultrasonic energy.

He was a naturalist who painted numerous paintings of landscapes and village life on eastern Zealand . Ring preferred to paint in the autumn and winter months, and the images, which typically have a greyish, silvery tinge, were affected by the winter light in the color scheme. Unlike his father, he has also painted many cityscapes from Copenhagen . He died in K\u00f8ge and is buried at Klosterkirkeg\u00e5rden.

The company is mostly known for being one of the three concessionaires who ran the Israeli commercial television channel Channel 2 between the years 1993\u20132005. It currently operates as a subsidiary of NMC United Entertainment . History The company was founded in the 1960s by Uzi Peled as a small production company in Jerusalem named \"Idan\" and provided services to the Israeli Channel 1 and to TV stations worldwide. \"Idan\" was reestablished in 1973 into \"Telad\" as part of a joint establishment with the Israeli investment firm Israel Discount Bank . Telad initially worked with Channel 1 and the experimental Channel 2 .

{"id": "doc_random_074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_DeWitt", "text": "Samuel Aaron DeWitt (November 1, 1891 \u2013 January 22, 1963) was an American businessman, poet , playwright , and politician. He was a New York State Legislator who represented Bronx 's 7th district from 1919 until his expulsion from the assembly in 1920 during the First Red Scare . Biography DeWitt was born on November 1, 1891, in New York City . He worked as a machinery dealer and was an active Socialist throughout his life. DeWitt first applied for membership in the Socialist Party on August 29, 1913. Political career DeWitt's official State Assembly portrait, 1920 Sam Dewitt is most famous for being expelled in 1920 from the New York State Assembly along with four fellow assemblymen for being members of the Socialist Party . The five Socialists were barred from taking their seats at the beginning of the session of the 143rd New York State Legislature and, after a protracted \"trial\" before the Assembly Committee on the Judiciary, defended by Morris Hillquit and Seymour Stedman , were expelled on April 1. All five were re-elected at a special election on September 16, and appeared to take their seats at the beginning of the special session on September 20. The next day, DeWitt and Samuel Orr were permitted to take their seats, but August Claessens , Charles Solomon and Louis Waldman were expelled again. Protesting against the re-expulsion of their comrades, DeWitt and Orr resigned their seats. Afterwards DeWitt was a frequent candidate for political office, without success. He ran in the Bronx 7th District in 1924 and 1926, for Bronx borough president in 1925, for the Bronx 3rd District in 1927 and 1929, and the Queens 4th District in 1932. DeWitt made several unsuccessful campaigns for United States Congress , running in the New York's 22nd district in 1928 and the 2nd district in 1934 , 1935 , and 1936 . During the bitter faction fights of the 1930s in the Socialist Party, DeWitt authored a weekly piece for The Socialist Call, a newspaper published each Saturday in New York City in opposition to the journal of the Old Guard faction , The New Leader. DeWitt authored a regular column called \"Turn to the Left,\" in which he expounded upon his political beliefs. While not accepting the Old Guard's extreme gradualist approach, neither was DeWitt a communist. With regard to the Communist Party's efforts to establish a united front in 1935, DeWitt wrote: \"I can only deplore [the Communists'] capacity for hatred. I can only distrust their sincerity when they call me to a 'united front.' I can only say to them: 'Lenin was a great teacher and undoubtedly a great leader. But he was a human. \"It is quite possible that he erred when he instructed you to treat Socialists who believed in achieving revolution through democracy in other lands, as enemies of the workers. It is also quite possible that he was wrong in his decision that all means, mostly foul, must be used against the enemies of the masses. ... It is also possible that Socialists have a right to question whether Lenin or you or any of your committees are God.'\" The battle between the Old Guard headed by Louis Waldman against a bloc of the Militant faction of Jack Altman with the \"Progressive\" group headed by Norman Thomas came to a head in the last days of 1935. DeWitt sided decisively with the latter grouping, breaking ranks with his long-time comrades of the Old Guard. DeWitt stood as a candidate for the New York State Committee of the SPA as part of the Progressive/Militant slate in the April 2, 1936, New York primaries and he won election in Queens County Assembly District 4. The Progressive/Militant bloc won a comfortable majority of seats on the State Committee in this election. In a last-gasp effort to retain power, New York Socialist Party State Chairman Waldman called a snap reorganizational meeting on 3 days' notice after the certification of the primary results, to be held in the distant city of Buffalo , as was his prerogative under that state constitution. The Old Guard was defeated in this effort to outmaneuver their opposition with timing and geography, however, and Harry W. Laidler defeated Waldman in his bid for re-election at the April reorganizational meeting by a vote of 60-42. DeWitt was elected State Treasurer of the Socialist Party of New York at this session. Literary endeavors DeWitt was a long-time friend of left wing writer Upton Sinclair . In Sinclair's famous muckraking novel The Jungle , published in 1906, one of the main characters, Nicolas Schliemann, is said to be based on Sam DeWitt. Throughout his life, DeWitt was a poet and a playwright, publishing books in both genres. Later years, death and legacy In late 1919, Sam DeWitt founded the DeWitt Tool Company, located in the machine tool district of New York City. The firm bought and sold used machinery and equipment, and included among its services the liquidation of defunct industrial plants. Early on the company had for its slogan \"The House of a Thousand Bargains.\" The business is still in the family - now DeWitt Bros Tool Company - in Kenilworth NJ.

Incumbent Mayor Mike Huether , first elected in 2010 , ran for re-election to a second term. He was challenged by City Councilmember Greg Jamison . Huether defeated Jamison by a wide margin, though slightly reduced from his margin four years earlier, winning 56\u201344 percent. Candidates Mike Huether , incumbent Mayor Greg Jamison , City Councilmember Campaign Huether announced that he would seek a second term as mayor, arguing that he had \"a pattern for getting stuff done for the city.\" Greg Jamison , a member of the City Council, announced that he would challenge Huether for re-election, and \"sharply criticiz[ed] Huether in his announcement, saying, \"If we don't change the culture at City Hall, the Sioux Falls I've grown [in] and the quality of life . . . is going to be ruined.\" Throughout the campaign, Jamison attacked Huether for his leadership style and unwillingness to compromise with others. Though the race was formally nonpartisan, the county Republican Party sent a postcard attacking Huether, a Democrat, shortly before the election. The postcard compared Huether to then-President Barack Obama , said that he supported \"higher taxes\" and acted \"like a dictator.\" Both Huether and Jamison, a Republican, condemned the postcard. The Argus Leader endorsed Huether for another term, praising him for \"presid[ing] over one of the more productive, transformative times in Sioux Falls history.\" Though the Argus Leader criticized him for \"[h]is forceful approach to governing\" and his \"investment in a local development project,\" it noted that he was \"a hard worker, a dedicated public servant and a driving, focused leader.\" It praised Jamison as \"an earnest public servant, well-intentioned and dedicated,\" but not \"the best fit for the mayor's position\" when matched against Huether. Ultimately, Huether defeated Jamison by a wide margin, winning 56 percent of the vote to Jamison's 43 percent.

AOPEN used to be the Open System Business Unit of Acer Computer Inc. which designed, manufactured and sold computer components. It was incorporated in December 1996 as a subsidiary of Acer Group with an initial public offering (IPO) at the Taiwan stock exchange in August 2002. It is also the first subsidiary that established the entrepreneurship paradigm in the pan-Acer Group. At that time, AOPENs major shareholder was the Wistron Group . In 2018 AOPEN became a partner of the pan-Acer Group again as the business-to-business branch of the computing industry. They are perhaps most well known for their \"Mobile on Desktop\" (MoDT), which implements Intel's Pentium M platform on desktop motherboards. Because the Pentium 4 and other NetBurst CPUs proved less energy efficient than the Pentium M, in late 2004 and early 2005, many manufacturers introduced desktop motherboards for the mobile Pentium M, AOPEN being one of the first. AOPEN currently specializes in ultra small form factor (uSFF) platform applications; digital signage ; and product development and designs characterized by miniaturization, standardization and modularization. AOpen logo used since 1996 until 2013 Product position and strategies Since 2005 AOPEN has been developing energy-saving products. According to different types of customers, applications and contexts, AOPEN splits its product platforms into two major categories: media player platform and Panel PC platform, both of which have Windows, Linux, ChromeOS and Android devices. Digital Signage Platform There are six major parts in AOPEN's digital signage platform applications: media player, management, deployment, display, extension and software. AOPEN manufacturers the digital signage media players with operating system and pre-imaging. This also includes a remote management option.

It was established by the Irish Government in 1991. It is a company limited by guarantee, funded mainly through the Heritage Council. It has registered as a charity with the Charities Regulator . Its primary aim is to benefit the community by the advancement of culture, heritage and sciences, and in particular by enhancing the understanding of Ireland\u2019s past through archaeological and related research in the humanities and sciences, establishing and directing research programmes, promoting such research; and promoting an appreciation of Ireland\u2019s archaeological heritage through education and outreach programmes. Projects Tara Research Project The Discovery Programme began carrying out research at Tara in 1992, often in collaboration with the Centre for Archaeological Survey at the Department of Archaeology, NUI Galway. The research on Tara led to the publication of a guidebook for a general audience, \"Tara: The Guidebook\". Western Stone Forts The Western Stone Forts Project was initiated to study a distinctive group of large stone forts located along the western seaboard of Ireland, including D\u00fan Aonghasa on the Aran Islands, which was excavated in the period 1992 to 1995. The project led to the publication of the book \"D\u00fan Aonghasa: The Guidebook\". Ogham The \"Ogham in 3D\" project is a collaboration between the School of Celtic Studies, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies , the Irish National Monuments Service and The Discovery Programme. The ultimate aim of the project was to laser-scan as many as possible of the approximately four hundred surviving Ogham stones in Ireland and in areas such as Wales, the Isle of Man, Devon and Cornwall, and Scotland. The project was launched on 9 May 2015 and has carried out fieldwork in Kerry, Waterford, Roscommon, Mayo, Clare, Cork, and Kilkenny. Archaeology 2025 \"Archaeology 2025\" is a long-term strategy to promote Irish archaeology into the future. Launched in 2016, it is an initiative of the Royal Irish Academy (RIA) and the development of the strategy from 2015 to 2017 has been facilitated by the Discovery Programme. Funding The core funding of The Discovery Programme is an annual grant from The Heritage Council that amounted to \u20ac750,000 in 2015, a 40% drop from its peak in 2008. In common with all HEIs and cultural institutions, The Discovery Programme is expected to seek funding from other sources.

{"id": "doc_random_084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teina_Pora", "text": "Teina Pora (born 1975) is a New Zealander who was wrongfully convicted of murdering a woman he had never met, named Susan Burdett, when he was aged 17; he served 20 years in Paremoremo prison from 1994, until he was paroled in 2014. In 1992, 39-year-old Burdett was raped and murdered in her home in Papatoetoe, Auckland . She was repeatedly struck in the head with a softball bat. About a year later, Pora who was a Mongrel Mob prospect at the time, was arrested on other charges and, when he learned there was $20,000 reward for information, claimed he was there when the murder happened. He was interviewed for 14 hours without a lawyer present, and was later said to have a mental age of nine or 10 at the time of the crime due to foetal alcohol syndrome . The police and jury were unaware of this, and in 1994, he was convicted of rape and murder. In 1999, Malcolm Rewa was found guilty of raping Susan Burdett on the night she died. Pora appealed his conviction, but in 2000, was found guilty for the crime a second time. After spending 20 years in prison, Pora was released on parole in April 2014. However, he continued to maintain his innocence, and the convictions were quashed by the Privy Council in March 2015, notably being the last ruling rendered by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council with respect to an appeal from the courts of New Zealand. He was awarded NZ$3,509,048 compensation and received a government apology for being wrongfully convicted of rape and murder. In 2019, Malcolm Rewa was subsequently found guilty of Burdett's murder. Early history Teina Pora was born with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder , caused by his mother's drinking during pregnancy. He grew up in \u014ctara . His father was never around and his teenage mother died of cancer when he was four. After his mother's death, Pora lived with grandparents and other family members, including an aunt who tried to raise him as her own son. As a teenager he spent time in boys' homes but often ran away. His brother told TV3's 3rd Degree programme that by the time he was a teenager, Pora was already doing \"heaps of crime\" but that \"he was never a violent person\". The murder of Susan Burdett Susan Burdett was a 39-year-old accounts clerk who lived alone in Papatoetoe and enjoyed ten pin bowling. On 23 March 1992, she went bowling at the Manukau Superstrike. After she got home, she had a shower and was then raped and battered to death with a softball bat. When she was found, the softball bat, which she kept for her own protection, was found lying on the bed beside her. Background to Pora's involvement Pora and some friends were walking through a park in Manukau a few days after the murder when they found an old softball bat in a drain. It was not the weapon used in the Burdett murder as this was found beside her body at the scene of the crime. Unaware of this, when Pora's aunt found out about the bat in the drain, she suggested to police that Pora may have committed the murder. Police responded by interviewing Pora in April 1992 and again in May 1992. On both occasions he denied any involvement and provided hair and DNA samples to police, which excluded him as a suspect. However, his aunt continued to put forward the view that Pora was involved but the police concluded her information was unreliable. Pora's 'confession' Pora was a prolific car thief and almost a year later, he was arrested for failing to attend court. In the course of a \"general conversation\" with a police officer, Pora \"told him of his troubled life, told the officer he wanted to go straight, that he felt unwanted by his family and that he knew he was being sought by the Mongrel Mob and police\". After police told him there was a reward of $20,000 for assistance in capturing Susan Burdett's murderer, Pora claimed he knew who committed the crime. He said he drove two Mongrel Mob members to the house and acted as lookout while they went inside. Pora did not give the names of the Mongrel Mob members, but when police put two names to him, he went along with these suggestions. Later on, police determined the two Mongrel Mob members both had alibis and their DNA did not match that found in the body. The DNA came from Malcolm Rewa but police did not learn that until four years later. After claiming he was at the scene, Pora was held for the next four days during which he was questioned about the case for 14 hours without a lawyer. During the course of this drawn out interview, much of which was recorded on video, he frequently changed his story about what happened. After initially claiming he acted as a lookout for the two \"Mongrel Mob members\", he later said he went into the house after \"hearing noises and seeing the crimes being carried out\". Still later, he said he held Burdett down by the arms while the others raped her. Pora was subsequently charged with Burdett's rape and murder. In 1995, once Pora was in prison, he provided three more names to police after they offered him another $50,000 and said they would help when he came up for parole. Concerns about the confession According to The New Zealand Herald investigative reporter, Phil Taylor, who wrote extensively about the case, Pora's 'confession' was flawed. He \"couldn't find the street Burdett lived in, couldn't point out her house when police stood him in front of it, described Burdett as fair and fat when she was dark and slim, didn't know the (victim's) bed was a waterbed\u00a0...couldn't describe the house layout\u00a0... didn't know the position her body was left in, [and] said she screamed and yelled when her closest neighbour heard only a series of dull thuds. And those he claimed had raped her were all cleared by DNA.\" Gisli Gudjonsson , professor of forensic psychology at the Institute of Psychiatry , King's College, London , was asked to review the nine hours of videotaped interviews and talked with Pora in prison. Gudjonsson is an authority on how people can be induced to make false \"confessions\". He said Pora's confessions were the result of intellectual impairment and his desire to claim the $20,000 reward \u2013 Pora was told there was an \"indemnity against prosecution for non-principal offenders\". Gudjonsson believed the convictions were \"fundamentally flawed and unsafe\". Trials and hearings First trial 1994 No finger prints, DNA, or any other direct evidence linking Pora to the murder scene were produced in court. Nevertheless, despite the contradictory nature of Pora's 'confessions', the Crown successfully argued at his trial that no one would confess to being involved in such a brutal rape and murder if they were not actually involved. His aunt, Terry McLaughlin, was a key Crown witness at the trial. Court documents showed she was paid $5000 to testify against him at the trial. Police have refused Official Information Act requests about payments made to other witnesses against Pora but the NZ Herald reported that a minimum of three witnesses were paid and received a total of $15,000. Conviction of Malcolm Rewa for rape In 1999, Malcolm Rewa was convicted of raping Susan Burdett after semen at the crime scene was found to be his. He was also found guilty of raping numerous other women and currently serves preventive detention for these attacks. Rewa's offending went on for some years before the police finally brought him to justice. In 2014, TV3's 3rd Degree programme suggested police had overlooked Rewa's involvement in six different sexual assaults. The Independent Police Conduct Authority (IPCA) was then asked to investigate the failure of the police to investigate Rewa's previous rapes including one particular sexual attack which occurred in 1987, five years before he raped Susan Burdett. Police eventually apologised to Malcolm Rewa's victims over the length of time it took to catch him and prevent any further offending. Rewa was also charged with the murder of Susan Burdett. Detective sergeant David Henwood thought the reason the jury failed to convict Rewa of the murder was that they could not reconcile this possibility with the knowledge that Pora had already been convicted for it. So although Rewa was found guilty for sexually assaulting Ms Burdett on the night she died, the jury at the time was unable to decide whether he was involved in her murder. However, in 2015 Pora's conviction was overturned, and in 2019, Rewa was tried again and found guilty of the murder. Malcolm Rewa's offending profile When prosecuting Rewa, the police argued that Rewa and Pora committed the crime together. The difficulty with this view is that Rewa had a track record as a lone offender \u2013 a serial stalker and rapist who was convicted of attacks on 24 other women. Rewa and Pora also came from rival gangs and were significantly different in age; Rewa was 40 and a senior member of the Highway 61 gang while Pora was a 16-year-old Mongrel Mob associate. Evidence put to the Privy Council also suggested that Rewa suffered from erectile dysfunction and would have been unlikely to have had an accomplice because of his embarrassment about this. Professor Laurence Alison, chair of forensic psychology at Liverpool University , concluded that it is \"highly unlikely\" Malcolm Rewa would have worked with any co-offender, let alone with Pora. He said: \"These conclusions would have been much harder to arrive at at the time of Teina Pora's appeal since far less was known about behavioural profiling and specific co-offending patterns in rape.\" Pora's second trial 2000 Pora appealed his conviction after the semen in Ms Burdett's body was found to belong to Malcolm Rewa. The Court of Appeal ordered a retrial and in 2000, Pora was found guilty a second time. Pora then applied for the royal prerogative of mercy , under which the Governor-General can order a new trial. In May 2013, his legal team prepared an appeal to the Privy Council to have his convictions quashed which put his application for mercy on hold. Police concerns about Pora's conviction Two police officers expressed concerns that Pora was wrongly convicted. Detective Sergeant Dave Henwood, a criminal profiler , believed Rewa raped and murdered Mrs Burdett and acted alone, based on his knowledge of Rewa's criminal signature. In 2012 a second senior officer, who also worked on the case, wrote to Police Commissioner Peter Marshall expressing his concern that the wrong man had been convicted. Susan's brother, Jim Burdett, also believed that Rewa was the one who raped and killed his sister. He believed Susan stood up for herself, that Rewa took the bat off her that she kept for self-defence and \"struck the blows that killed her\". Calls for inquiry In 2013, the Police Association officially called for a review of Pora's conviction, citing \"sufficient concern among some senior detectives to warrant an inquiry\". The M\u0101ori Party also backed an inquiry in the case. A documentary about his case titled The Confessions of Prisoner T was aired on M\u0101ori Television on 5 May 2013. It featured defence lawyer, Marie Dyhrberg, who said that out of all the criminals she has ever been involved with, she believed in Pora's innocence more than any other. In response to the documentary, the Green Party also called for a review. Green Party spokesman David Clendon wrote to Police Commissioner Peter Marshall asking him to reopen the case. He said \"serious misconduct by police was rare in New Zealand\", but \"it was important to maintain the public's faith in the justice system by holding a review\". Parole hearings Over his 20 years in prison, Pora made numerous appearances before the parole board. At those hearings he repeatedly denied he had any part in Burdett's murder, which made it difficult for the board to grant him parole. His 12th attempt to be released on parole was declined in October 2013 after he admitted visiting a prostitute with a former inmate while on temporary leave. He was finally released in April 2014. At a monitoring hearing five months later, the board noted he was doing well but added: \"Given his lengthy time in prison, and limited education before (being) imprisoned, (reintegration) will be a difficult and necessarily slow process of which he is aware.\" Privy Council hearing 2014 On 31 January 2014 the Judicial Committee announced that Pora had been granted permission to take his case to the Privy Council in London later in 2014. The hearing was held in November. Pora's lawyer Jonathan Krebs told the Privy Council his client had recently been diagnosed with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder and had a mental age of nine or 10 at the time of the crime. He said this disability meant Pora was easily confused, had a drive to please others, and that his confession in 1993 should therefore be seen as unreliable. Questions were also asked about the people named by Pora as having committed the murder. One of the Privy Council judges, Lord Toulson asked New Zealand's Solicitor-General \"Why didn't Pora name [Malcolm] Rewa?\" The explanation given by Pora's lawyers was that \"Pora couldn't name Rewa because Pora didn't know him and because Pora wasn't there\". The Privy Council quashed Pora's convictions on 3 March 2015. Compensation and apology On 15 June 2016, Teina Pora was awarded NZ$2.52 million compensation and received a government apology for being wrongfully convicted of rape and murder. Retired High Court judge Rodney Hansen, QC , who was appointed by the government to review the case after the Privy Council quashed Pora's convictions, said he could have found Pora innocent on a higher standard than the balance of probabilities. In July 2017, Pora appealed the amount awarded, submitting that it had been calculated on 1998 guidelines that awarded $100,000 per year, and had not been adjusted for inflation as recommended by Judge Hansen. The court upheld the appeal in August 2017. In September 2017, the general election resulted in a change of government, and incoming Justice Minister Andrew Little announced that the outgoing government's intention to appeal the decision would not go ahead and Pora's compensation would be increased to match inflation. A few days later Little announced Pora would receive an extra $988,099 bringing his total compensation to $3,509,048. Impact on justice system This case has been one of a number of high profile miscarriages of justice in New Zealand in recent years. It was a factor in the Labour Government's decision to establish a Criminal Cases Review Commission in 2020. References ^ Taylor, Phil (30 March 2015). \"Pora forgives but is still fighting fit\" .

Four regular tournaments were played: The LV County Championship ( first-class ), Friends Provident Trophy ( 50 Over ), NatWest Pro40 League ( 40 Over ) and the Twenty20 Cup ( T20 ). All four tournaments featured the eighteen classic county cricket teams, although the Friends Provident Trophy also featured teams from Ireland and Scotland . In the county championship, Durham won their first championship title by 8 points from Nottinghamshire . Kent and Surrey were the two teams to be relegated to Division Two, with Surrey failing to register a win for the first time since 1871 . It completed a miserable season for Surrey, who also finished bottom of their Twenty20 Cup division and failed to progress from the group stage of the Friends Provident Trophy . Warwickshire and Worcestershire were the two teams promoted from Division Two. In the other competitions, Essex won the Friend's Provident Trophy with a 5 wicket victory over Kent; Sussex claimed the Pro40 Division 1 title with a last ball six, leaving Hampshire runners up. Last year's champions Worcestershire had to beat Glamorgan in the play-off to retain their Division 1 status for next year, while Middlesex and Lancashire were relegated. Essex bounced back from relegation last season to win the Division 2 title and, with it, a place in the top division alongside runners-up Yorkshire . Middlesex won their first domestic title in 15 years in the Twenty20 Cup with a 3 run win over reigning champions Kent.

Gross domestic product per capita is often used as a proxy indicator an indicator of a country's standard of living ; however, this is inaccurate because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income and does not take into account social and environmental costs and benefits. Measures of personal income include average wage , real income , median income , disposable income and gross national income (GNI) per capita. Comparisons of GDP per capita are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade , and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures. GDP per capita does not consider differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results may vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency . Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, while the standard of living of its population might not change by as much. Several leading GDP-per-capita (nominal) jurisdictions may be considered tax havens , and their GDP data subject to material distortion by tax-planning activities. Examples include Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland and Luxembourg. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories ) and states with limited international recognition are included in the list in cases in which they appear in the sources. These economies are not ranked in the charts (except Kosovo and Taiwan), but are listed in sequence by GDP for comparison. Four UN members (Cuba, Monaco and North Korea) do not belong to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), hence their economies are not ranked. Kosovo, is not a member of the United Nations and is a member of the IMF. Taiwan is not an IMF member, but it is listed in the official IMF indices. Distorted GDP-per-capita for tax havens Main articles: Corporate haven \u00a7\u00a0GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy , and Corporate haven \u00a7\u00a0Distorted GDP/GNP Many of the leading GDP-per-capita (nominal) jurisdictions are tax havens whose economic data is artificially inflated by tax-driven corporate accounting entries. For instance, the Irish GDP data above is subject to material distortion by the tax planning activities of foreign multinationals in Ireland. To address this, in 2017 the Central Bank of Ireland created \" modified GNI \" (or GNI*) as a more appropriate statistic, and the OECD and IMF have adopted it for Ireland. 2015 Irish GDP is 143% of 2015 Irish GNI*. A stunning $12 trillion\u2014almost 40 percent of all foreign direct investment positions globally\u2014is completely artificial: it consists of financial investment passing through empty corporate shells with no real activity. These investments in empty corporate shells almost always pass through well-known tax havens. The eight major pass-through economies\u2014the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Hong Kong SAR, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, and Singapore\u2014host more than 85 percent of the world\u2019s investment in special purpose entities, which are often set up for tax reasons. \u2014\u200a\"Piercing the Veil\", International Monetary Fund , June 2018 Table All data are in current United States dollars .

{"id": "doc_random_087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Shot_(song)", "text": "This article is about the Billy Joel song. For other uses, see Big Shot (disambiguation) . \" Big Shot \" is a song performed by Billy Joel from his 1978 album 52nd Street as its opening track, released as a single in early 1979. The song would become the second hit single from the album, peaking at No. 14 in the United States. Lyrics and music The song is superficially about the protagonist mocking a woman with a severe hangover for her intoxicated escapades around town, making numerous social and verbal faux pas while high on alcohol and other drugs (\"But now you just don't remember all the things you said / And you're not sure you want to know / I'll give you one hint, honey; you sure did put on a show!\"). The song makes reference to late 1970s nouveau riche fads such as Elaine's restaurant and Halston . During a Q&A session at Florida State University in 1996, Joel stated the song is about someone he was very close to, and also about himself. In an interview in 2006, Joel said, \"I read that the song 'Big Shot' is said to be about a date I had with Bianca Jagger . I never had a date with Bianca Jagger.\" But in an interview with Howard Stern on November 16, 2010, Joel said the song was written after having dinner with Mick and Bianca Jagger. Joel told Stern that while writing the lyrics to \"Big Shot\", he was thinking of Mick singing the song to Bianca. In the official music video, Joel does appear to be mimicking Mick Jagger during the second verse. Reception Billboard described \"Big Shot\" as \"an upbeat rocker\" with \"very contemporary lyrical content\", stating that it was driven by \"powerfully rhythmic backing\". Cash Box said it is \"tough-edged and sassy\" with \"a dramatic arrangement of guitars, piano, horns and drums\", a \"rich\" lyric and \"catchy\" vocals. Record World said that \"Joel's fine sense of sarcasm and his finesse as a story-teller are perfectly blended.\" Walter Everett characterized the song's live performances as \"swaggering bravado\", epitomized by Joel's stage presence through \"stage-crossing, piano-hopping, chest-thumping performances\". Release The single release of the song had an abridged outro compared to the album version. Live versions were released on the albums Kohuept , 2000 Years: The Millennium Concert , 12 Gardens Live , and My Lives . Rock Band 3 The song was made available to download on December 14, 2010, for use in the Rock Band 3 music gaming platform in both Basic rhythm, and PRO mode which allows the use of a real guitar/bass guitar, and MIDI-compatible electronic drum kits/keyboards in addition to vocals.

{"id": "doc_random_088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_electromyography", "text": "Facial electromyography ( fEMG ) refers to an electromyography (EMG) technique that measures muscle activity by detecting and amplifying the tiny electrical impulses that are generated by muscle fibers when they contract. It primarily focuses on two major muscle groups in the face, the corrugator supercilii group which is associated with frowning and the zygomaticus major muscle group which is associated with smiling. Uses Zygomaticus major muscle (associated with smiling) Facial EMG has been studied to assess its utility as a tool for measuring emotional reaction. Studies have found that activity of the corrugator muscle, which lowers the eyebrow and is involved in producing frowns, varies inversely with the emotional valence of presented stimuli and reports of mood state . Activity of the zygomatic major muscle, which controls smiling, is said to be positively associated with positive emotional stimuli and positive mood state. Facial EMG has been used as a technique to distinguish and track positive and negative emotional reactions to a stimulus as they occur. A large number of those experiments have been conducted in controlled laboratory environments using a range of stimuli, e.g., still pictures, movie clips and music pieces. It has also been used to investigate emotional responses in individuals with autism spectrum disorders. Although commonly used as an index of emotional responses, facial muscle activity is also influenced by the social context in which it is measured. Using facial EMG in immersive virtual environments, Philipp, Storrs, and Vanman showed that even relatively impoverished social cues in a virtual environment can cause increases in zygomaticus major activity that are unrelated to self-reported emotional states. In a study in 2012, Durso et al. demonstrated that facial EMG could detect confusion in subjects who acknowledged they were confused and in those who did not. The authors considered facial EMG could effectively monitor loss of understanding or of situation awareness . Market research and gaming Two areas where facial EMG techniques have been used are in advertising research and in video gaming . Advertising research - Of late, facial EMG has been used to test audience response to commercial advertising. Facial EMG activity measures during a viewing of commercials embedded in TV program clips have been used to describe a commercial's level of emotional activation and engagement. Measurement of the corrugator and zygomatic muscles, yield an overall positive and negative emotional activation score. The moment to moment activation that are recorded are said to measure the dynamic emotional response to a commercial and yield useful insights about the elements of the commercials. Lou et al. showed that facial EMG activity can be used to forecast how game players would be addicted to an online game before the game is officially introduced to the market. Gaming and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) - Ravaja, Hazlett and Mandryk used facial EMG techniques to demonstrate that positive and negative emotions can be measured in real time during video game play. The emotional profiling of games give a useful evaluation of a game's impact on a player, how compelling they find the game, how the game measures up to other games in its genre, and how the different elements of the game enhance or detract from the game's approach to engaging the player. Advantages Proponents of Facial EMG point to the following advantages: Facial Electromyography (or fEMG) is a precise and sensitive method to measure emotional expression. Unlike self-reports, fEMG does not depend upon language and does not require cognitive effort or memory. fEMG is capable of registering the response even when subjects were instructed to inhibit their emotional expression. Yields a lot of data and is continuous and scalar (hence more credible.) It is able to measure facial muscle activities to even weakly evocative emotional stimuli. Less intrusive than other physiological measures like fMRI and EEG . Like other physiological measures, facial EMG measurement technique is often the only useful approach when movement is not visible. Criticisms The technique is intrusive and may alter natural expression. The number of muscles it can employ is limited by how many electrodes can be attached to the face. Certain medicines that act on the nervous system, such as muscle relaxants and anticholinergics , can change electromyography (EMG) results.

{"id": "doc_random_089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_Control_Act_of_1968", "text": "The Gun Control Act of 1968 ( GCA or GCA68 ) is a U.S. federal law that regulates the firearms industry and firearms ownership. Due to constitutional limitations, the Act is primarily based on regulating interstate commerce in firearms by generally prohibiting interstate firearms transfers except by manufacturers, dealers and importers licensed under a scheme set up under the Act. The GCA was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on October 22, 1968, and is Title I of the U.S. federal firearms laws. The National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA) is Title II. Both GCA and NFA are enforced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). 18 USC chapter 44 was first enacted by the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 . GCA repealed the Federal Firearms Act of 1938 , though many of its provisions were reenacted as part of the GCA, which revised the FFA and its predecessor, the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA). History The bill was initially prompted by the assassination of U.S. president John F. Kennedy in 1963. The president was shot and killed with a rifle purchased by mail order from an ad in the magazine American Rifleman . Congressional hearings followed and a ban on mail-order gun sales was discussed, but no law was passed until 1968. At the hearings NRA executive vice-president Franklin Orth supported a ban on mail-order sales, stating, \"We do not think that any sane American, who calls himself an American, can object to placing into this bill the instrument which killed the president of the United States.\" Precursors of the passage of the Gun Control Act were Senate Bill 1975 in 1963, \"A Bill to Regulate the Interstate Shipment of Firearms\", and Senate Bill 1592 in 1965, \"A Bill to Amend the Federal Firearms Act of 1938\". Both were introduced by Senator Thomas J. Dodd but in both cases the bill was met with fierce opposition, effectively shutting down the earliest efforts for gun control legislation regarding the mail-order rifles. The bill was once again introduced into the House of Representatives by the House Judiciary Committee on January 10, 1967, with this instance resulting in the bill staying on the legislative docket. The April 4, 1968, assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. , shortly followed by the June 5 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy , as well as the shooting at the University of Texas two years previously , compounded by shifting societal attitudes towards gun ownership, renewed efforts to pass the bill. On June 11, 1968, a tie vote in the House Judiciary Committee halted the bill's passage. On reconsideration nine days later, the bill was passed by the committee. The Senate Judiciary Committee similarly brought the bill to a temporary halt, but as in the House, it was passed on reconsideration. House Resolution 17735, known as the Gun Control Act, was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on October 22, 1968 banning mail-order sales of rifles and shotguns and prohibiting most felons, drug users, and people found mentally incompetent from buying guns. This act also included provisions that redefined the definitions of firearms within the United States and provided more rules for weapons manufacturers and licensed sellers on interstate commerce of ammunition and other firearm accessories. Prohibited persons When it took effect in 1968, the Gun Control Act of 1968 stated that firearm sales were prohibited to anyone who \"(1) is under indictment for, or has been convicted in a court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; (2) is a fugitive from justice; (3) is an unlawful user of or addicted to marijuana or any depressant or stimulant drug (as defined in section 201 (v) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) or narcotic drug (as defined in section 4731 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954)\" The Gun Control Act of 1968 was amended in 1993 by the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act which introduced a background check requirement of prospective gun purchasers by licensed sellers, and created a list of categories of individuals to whom the sale of firearms is prohibited: It would also be amended again in 1994 by the Violence Against Women Act to strengthen firearm bans against domestic abusers. The amended law stated: It shall be unlawful for any person to sell or otherwise dispose of any firearm or ammunition to any person knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such person\u2014 (1) is under indictment for, or has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; (2) is a fugitive from justice; (3) is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802)); (4) has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution at 16 years of age or older; (5) who, being an alien; (A) is illegally or unlawfully in the United States; or (B) except as provided in subsection (y)(2), has been admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa (as that term is defined in section 101(a)(26) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 (a)(26))) (6) who has been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions; (7) who, having been a citizen of the United States, has renounced their citizenship; (8) is subject to a court order that restrains such person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner of such person or child of such intimate partner or person, or engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child, except that this paragraph shall only apply to a court order that\u2014 (A) was issued after a hearing of which such person received actual notice, and at which such person had the opportunity to participate; and (B) (i) includes a finding that such person represents a credible threat to the physical safety of such intimate partner or child; or (ii) by its terms explicitly prohibits the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against such intimate partner or child that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury; or (9) has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. With the following exceptions: (ii) A person shall not be considered to have been convicted of such an offense for purposes of this chapter if the conviction has been expunged or set aside, or is an offense for which the person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored (if the law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil rights under such an offense) unless the pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms. 18 U.S.C 922 (3) imposes punishment for being a drug addict, which was found to be unconstitutional by SCOTUS in Robinson v. California in 1962. While many states upon completion of a sentence automatically reinstate rights to vote, sit on a jury, or serve in public office, no states restore gun ownership rights upon completion of a sentence, with the exception of Wyoming . Some states reinstate rights depending on the crime convicted of, and others have a petition process. In 2023 the state of Wyoming became the first state to automatically restore gun ownership rights to non-violent felons, who complete their sentence; W.S. \u00a77-13-105 went into effect on July 1, 2023 and allows individuals that are convicted as a first time, non-violent felon, to have their right to vote, serve on a jury, hold public office and possess a firearm restored five years after their completion of sentence including applicable periods of probation or parole. Those convicted of a federal offense must contact the Office of the Pardon Attorney, Department of Justice, to receive a presidential pardon. Under the Department's rules governing petitions for executive clemency, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1.1 et seq., an applicant must satisfy a minimum waiting period of five years before he becomes eligible to apply for a presidential pardon of his federal conviction. According to a 21 Sep 2011 \"Open Letter to All Federal Firearms Licensees\" from the ATF, holders of state-issued medical marijuana cards are automatically \"prohibited people\" under 18 U.S.C 922 (g)(3) and \"shipping, transporting, receiving or possessing firearms or ammunition\" by a medical marijuana card holder is a violation. Additionally, 18 U.S.C 922 (x) generally prohibits people under 18 years of age from possessing handguns or handgun ammunition with certain exceptions for employment, target practice, education, and a handgun possessed while defending the home of the juvenile or a home in which they are a guest. On January 25, 2025 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit made a landmark opinion in the case of Reese v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), holding that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(b)(1) and (c)(1), which prohibit federal firearms licensees (FFLs) from selling handguns to individuals aged 18 to 20, are unconstitutional under the Second Amendment. The case arose from three non-profit youth sport shooting group's who were unable to obtain handguns from an FFL dealer due to their members being under 21, they filed a suit alleging that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(b)(1) and (c)(1) not only violates the Second Amendment but also the Fifth Amendment's equal protection clause. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 created the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to prevent firearms sales to such prohibited people. The Violence Against Women Act of 1994 strengthened bans against domestic abusers by enforcing domestic violence protection orders which barred people subject to family violence protection orders from having firearms. In 2025, a federal court ruling struck down 18 U.S.C 922 (g)(3) as being unconstitutional when applied to occasional users of marijuana and other drugs, so long as they are not impaired at the time of possession or use of a firearm. The 2025 ruling stems from a unanimous ruling in August of 2023 in which a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the April 2022 conviction of Patrick Daniels, Jr. who was charged with several counts of unlawful possession of a firearm after law enforcement officers searched his car during a stop and found marijuana butts and two loaded firearms; a drug test wasn't administered but Daniels admitted to being a regular user; the court's ruling stated \"history and tradition may support some limits on an intoxicated person\u2019s right to carry a weapon, but it does not justify disarming a sober citizen based exclusively on his past drug usage nor does it support permanently disarming nonviolent drug users\". This ruling was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States who reversed the opinion of the 5th Circuit Court and ordered them to rehear the case in light of it being found Daniels was also under an order of protection for domestic violence. On January 6, 2025 the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals issued a revised ruling based on Daniels domestic violence charge and the SCOTUS ruling that it is not unconstitutional and in line with history to disarm someone who is threatening physical violence. Their revised ruling determined that \"922(g)(3) was not per se unconstitutional\" and allowed the statute itself to stand, agreeing it was valid if it was determined an individual was actively impaired by illegal drug use at the time; but also determined it could not be used to constitutionally disarm someone for life, based solely on habitual or occasional drug use. The conclusion of their opinion stated that 922(g)(3) might apply to someone whose drug use is so frequent \"that is renders them continually impaired\". Federal Firearms License (FFL) system Main article: Federal Firearms License The Gun Control Act mandated the licensing of individuals and companies engaged in the business of selling firearms. This provision effectively prohibited the direct mail order of firearms (except antique firearms ) by consumers and mandated that anyone who wants to buy a gun in an interstate transaction from a source other than a private individual must do so through a federally licensed firearms dealer. The Act also banned unlicensed individuals from acquiring handguns outside their state of residence. The interstate purchase of long guns (rifles and shotguns) was not impeded by the Act so long as the seller is federally licensed and such a sale is allowed by both the state of purchase and the state of residence. Private sales between residents of two different states are also prohibited without going through a licensed dealer, except for the case of a buyer holding a Curio & Relic license purchasing a firearm that qualifies as a curio or relic. Private sales between unlicensed individuals who are residents of the same state are allowed under federal law so long as such transfers do not violate the other existing federal and state laws. While current law mandates that a background check be performed if the seller has a federal firearms license, private parties living in the same state are not required to perform such checks under federal law. A person who does not have a Federal Firearms License may not be in the business of buying or selling firearms. Individuals buying and selling firearms without a federal license must be doing so from their collection. Under the Gun Control Act, a federally licensed importer, manufacturer, dealer, or collector shall not sell or deliver any rifle or shotgun or ammunition for rifle or shotgun to any individual less than 18 years of age, nor any handgun or ammunition for a handgun to any individual less than 21 years of age. Gunsmith and factory repair exception While the Gun Control Act prohibits the direct mail-ordering of firearms, a person may ship a gun via contract carrier (such as United Parcel Service (UPS), United States Postal Service , or FedEx ) to a gunsmith (who has an FFL) or the gunmaker's factory for repairs or modification. After the repair work is done, the gunsmith or the factory can ship the gun directly back to the customer. Import restrictions ATF Form 4590 (\"Factoring Criteria for Weapons\") The GCA created what is known as the \"sporting purposes\" standard for imported firearms, saying that they must \"be generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes\". GCA sporting purposes include hunting and organized competitive target shooting but do not include \" plinking \" or \" practical shooting \" (which the ATF says is closer to police/combat-style competition and not comparable to more traditional types of sports), nor does it allow for collection for historical or design interest. Marking requirements The law also required that all newly manufactured firearms produced by licensed manufacturers in the United States and imported into the United States bear a gun serial number . Firearms manufactured before the Gun Control Act and firearms manufactured by non-FFLs remain exempt from the serial number requirement. Defacement or removal of the serial number (if present) became a felony offense under the law where previously no serial number was required. Commentary In a June 1966 essay, Neal Knox wrote that what was then called the Dodd Bill was opposed by outdoorsmen and conservationists Harry R. Woodward , C. R. Gutermuth of the Wildlife Management Institute, Richard H. Stroud of the Sport Fishing Institute, Howard Carter Jr. of the National Shooting Sports Foundation , E. C. Hadley of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute , Robert T. Dennis of the Izaak Walton League , \"and countless other sportsmen, and sportsmen and industry groups\" because it would have a far-reaching and damaging effect on the hunting and shooting sports, while failing to reduce crime. In his remarks upon signing the act in October 1968, Johnson said: Congress adopted most of our recommendations. But this bill\u2014as big as this bill is\u2014still falls short, because we just could not get the Congress to carry out the requests we made of them. I asked for the national registration of all guns and the licensing of those who carry those guns. For the fact of life is that there are over 160 million guns in this country\u2014more firearms than families. If guns are to be kept out of the hands of the criminal, out of the hands of the insane, and out of the hands of the irresponsible, then we just must have licensing. If the criminal with a gun is to be tracked down quickly, then we must have registration in this country. The voices that blocked these safeguards were not the voices of an aroused nation. They were the voices of a powerful lobby, a gun lobby, that has prevailed for the moment in an election year. At the time of its passage in 1968, NRA executive vice president Franklin Orth wrote in American Rifleman that \"the measure as a whole appears to be one that the sportsmen of America can live with\". In the May 1993 issue of Guns & Ammo magazine, Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership (JPFO) compared the GCA to Nazi gun laws . In a 2011 article noting the death of former U.S. senator James A. McClure , the NRA called provisions of the GCA \"draconian\". McClure was a cosponsor of the Firearm Owners Protection Act (FOPA) of 1986, also called the McClure-Volkmer Act. Political scientist Robert Spitzer wrote in 2011 that the Gun Control Act of 1968 \"provides an ideal case study to highlight the political processes affecting a direct effort to regulate firearms\". He also stated in his book that President Johnson's proposal called for national registration of all guns as well as licensing for all gun carriers, but his influence over the enacted law was small. House Rules Committee chair William Colmer only released H.R. 17735 to the floor after Judiciary Committee chair Emanuel Celler promised to oppose efforts to add licensing and registration provisions.

{"id": "doc_random_091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tex_Erwin", "text": "Ross Emil \"Tex\" Erwin (December 22, 1885 \u2013 April 5, 1953) was an American professional baseball player from 1905 to 1921. He played six years in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the Detroit Tigers (1908), Brooklyn Superbas (1910\u201314), and Cincinnati Reds (1914). Early years Erwin was born in Forney, Texas , in 1885. He began his professional baseball career playing for the Fort Worth Panthers of the Texas League during the 1905 and 1906 seasons. He also played 11 games for the St. Paul Saints in the American Association during the 1906 season. In 1907, he played for the Topeka White Sox in the Western Association. In late August 1907, Erwin made his major league debut with the Detroit Tigers . He appeared in only eight games for Detroit and did not appear in any of the Tigers' postseason games in the 1907 World Series . After his brief stint with the Tigers, Erwin returned to the minor leagues, playing for the Rochester Bronchos of the Eastern League in 1908 and 1909. Brooklyn Erwin at Ebbetts Field , 1913 In August 1909, Erwin was purchased from Rochester by the Brooklyn Superbas of the National League . He played at the catcher position for Brooklyn from 1910 to 1914. In November 1912, the Sporting Life newspaper published a front-page photo profile of Erwin. The newspaper described him as \"the rising young catcher of the Brooklyn National League.\" The profile indicated that Erwin was married and made his permanent home in Rochester, New York , though his family lived in Galveston, Texas . In June 1913, Erwin suffered two fractures in his arm when Heinie Zimmerman of the Cubs slid into him at home plate. His playing time was limited thereafter. He appeared in only nine games for Brooklyn in 1914 before being released on waivers. The Sporting News later wrote that the collision with Zimmerman had \"practically ended his career.\" Cincinnati and minor leagues In July 1914, Erwin cleared waivers and was sent to Newark. Shortly thereafter, the Cincinnati Reds expressed interest in acquiring Erwin. Accordingly, he was reactivated by Brooklyn and thereupon sold to the Reds. He lasted less than three weeks in Cincinnati, appearing in only 12 games with his last major league game being on July 29, 1914. After being released by Cincinnati, Erwin continued to play professional baseball until 1921, including stints with the Rochester Hustlers (1915, 1918) and Dallas Submarines (1921). Erwin also served as a minor league umpire during the 1916 and 1917 seasons. Career statistics Erwin appeared in 276 major league games, compiling a .236 batting average and .326 on-base percentage with 150 hits, 82 bases on balls, 70 runs scored, 70 RBIs, 37 extra base hits, and 10 stolen bases. Later years After retiring from baseball, Erwin lived in Rochester, New York , with his wife and children, Adelaide and Ross, Jr. He worked for a time as a salesman and, in 1927, went into the insurance business. He served on the Rochester City Council from 1937 to 1945. In his later years, Erwin suffered from arthritis. He was hospitalized in February 1953 after a severe attack of arthritis. He died in a Rochester hospital in April 1953 at age 67. References ^ a b c \"Tex Erwin Minor League Statistics\" . baseball-reference.com .

{"id": "doc_random_093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba_Highway_59", "text": "Provincial Trunk Highway 59 ( PTH 59 ) is a major provincial highway in the Canadian province of Manitoba . It runs from the Lancaster-Tolstoi Border Crossing (where it meets with U.S. Highway 59 ), through the city of Winnipeg , north to 8th Avenue in Victoria Beach on Lake Winnipeg . Route description PTH 59 is a four-lane at-grade expressway from Provincial Road 210 south of \u00cele-des-Ch\u00eanes , through Winnipeg, to the Brokenhead Ojibway Nation , except for a two-kilometre section of six-lane road between the North Perimeter Highway (PTH 101) and Provincial Road 202 . The remainder of PTH 59 is a two-lane highway except within the communities of St. Pierre-Jolys and St. Malo . PTH 59 coincides with City Route 20 (Lagimodi\u00e8re Boulevard) as it runs through the eastern part of Winnipeg. North of the city, PTH 59 is the main route to Grand Beach and the eastern side of Lake Winnipeg and part of the La V\u00e9rendrye Trail . To the south, PTH 59 is effectively the modern-day successor to the original Crow Wing Trail as one of two main roads between Winnipeg and the United States border , serving as an alternative to PTH 75 . PTH 59 is also a main route on both sides of Winnipeg for rural Manitobans commuting to work in the city. Major intersections Related routes Provincial Road 319 Provincial Road 319 ( PR 319 ) is a 6.0-kilometre-long (3.7\u00a0mi) east\u2013west spur off of PTH 59 in the Rural Municipality of St. Clements , serving as the only road access into Patricia Beach Provincial Park , where it dead ends along the coastline of Lake Winnipeg . It is entirely a two-lane gravel road. Provincial Road 504 Provincial Road 504 ( PR 504 ) is a short 2.3-kilometre-long (1.4\u00a0mi) north-south spur of PTH 59 in the Rural Municipality of Victoria Beach , connecting the communities of Victoria Beach itself and Wanasing Beach with both the community and beach of Sandy Bay on Lake Winnipeg. Between PTH 59 and the intersection with Olafsson Boulevard and Hampton Road, PR 504 is a paved two-lane highway. Past this intersection though, it is a narrow single lane gravel road for the 0.1 kilometres (0.062\u00a0mi) to the dead end at the beach on Lake Winnipeg. Throughout its length, PR 504 travels through a mix of woodlands and lakeside neighbourhoods. Provincial Road 508 Provincial Road 508 ( PR 508 ), known as St. Peters Road for the majority of its length, is a 12.9-kilometre-long (8.0\u00a0mi) north\u2013south spur of PTH 59 in the Rural Municipality of St. Clements , providing access to the town of East Selkirk and St. Peter Dynevor Church Provincial Historic Site . The highway also runs along a portion of the La V\u00e9rendrye Trail for its entire length. PR 508 begins at the centre of East Selkirk at an intersection with PR 212 (Colville Road) along the banks of Cooks Creek , with the La V\u00e9rendrye Trail continuing west along PR 212 northbound. It heads north along St. Peters Road to travel through neighbourhoods for a few kilometres before leaving East Selkirk and crossing Dubas Creek . As it passes by the St. Peter Dynevor Church Provincial Historic Site, the highest begins following the east bank of the Red River , crossing PTH 4 before travelling through rural areas. Now turning away from the river via a sudden right turn onto Road 82N, travelling along the north side of Peguis 1H reserve of the Peguis First Nation for a few kilometres before coming to an end at a junction with PTH 59. La V\u00e9rendrye Trail continues east along PTH 59 northbound. The entire length of PR 508 is a paved, two-lane highway. Provincial Road 509 Provincial Road 509 ( PR 509 ), also known as CIL Road , is a short 1.6-kilometre-long (0.99\u00a0mi) east\u2013west spur of PTH 59, serving as a connection to the city of Selkirk via PR 204 ( La V\u00e9rendrye Trail ). It is entirely a paved two-lane highway, and includes a railway crossing near its western end. Between 1966 and 1968, PR 509 existed on an entirely different route, along a 11-kilometre-long (6.8\u00a0mi) spur of PR 308 in the Northwest Angle Provincial Forest , providing access to both Moose Lake and Birch Point Provincial Parks, as well as the coastline of Buffalo Bay on Lake of the Woods . Though now unnumbered, the road still exists as a two-lane gravel road and is still in use.

His designs have been at fashion shows in New York , Paris , London and S\u00e3o Paulo Fashion Weeks . Best known for avant-garde designs and eclectic prints, his trademark skulls became an icon of Brazilian youth in the 1990s. Early life Herchcovitch was born in S\u00e3o Paulo , Brazil. He is of Jewish descent, with his grandparents having immigrated to Brazil from Poland and Romania. He had his first contact with fashion through his mother, Regina, at the age of 10, when she gave him basic lessons of modelling and sewing at Herchcovitch's request. Regina started to wear the clothes he made in parties, which led him to sell his collections to friends. In his teens, Herchcovitch went to the alternative clubs of S\u00e3o Paulo nightlife, but at the same time he studied at an Orthodox Jewish school, a conflict that had a strong influence over his work afterwards. Products Selected products of his are sold in the United States, Canada , England , France , Spain and Australia . His first store in Tokyo has recently opened. Herchcovitch chose Tokyo because that is where a good part of his collections are purchased and where he has become somewhat of a fashion guru. The 1,076\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (100.0\u00a0m 2 ) store, which sits in the hip Daikanyama district, carries his men's, women's and denim collections and is operated in partnership with Japanese fashion distributor and retailer H.P. France. Honors In 2014, Herchcovitch became the first Brazilian fashion designer to receive the Ordem do M\u00e9rito Cultural . In 2024, Herchcovitch made a fashion exposition at the Jewish Museum of S\u00e3o Paulo . References ^ \" \"Tenho medo de n\u00e3o saber quando parar\", diz Herchcovitch\" .

A Welsh solo clog dancer extinguishing a candle using the sole edges of his clogs at the National Urdd Eisteddfod in Snowdonia (Eryri), 2012. The Welsh stepdance ( Welsh : Dawns stepio ) or Welsh clog dance ( Welsh : Clocsio ) is a traditional Welsh form of dance involving clog shoes and percussive movement of the feet and athletic movements. It is typically done to Welsh traditional music and wearing traditional Welsh costume , but not always. The Welsh stepdance is an unbroken tradition that was typically performed by slate quarry workmen and farmers. Dancers would often compete with each other to prove who had the most impressive dancing, stamina and athleticism. Welsh clog dancing also includes \"tricks\" which makes it unique compared to other forms of step dancing such as Irish dancing , Scottish dancing and English clog dancing . These tricks can include, but are not limited to; snuffing out a candle flame using the wooden soles of the shoes, toby stepping (kicking legs out in a squat position similarly to Cossack dancing) and high leaps into the air such as straddle jumping. Clogging does not simply involve dancing whilst wearing clogs. Clogging involves producing a variety of stronger or lighter sounds and a mixture of rhythms using both feet, which showcases the stepping dexterity. A talented clogger is able to make a variety of sounds by utilising different regions of the clog which include the toe, heel and sides of the clog against each other or other objects. Clogging can be performed on wood and slate and can be accompanied or unaccompanied. History A Welsh clog dancer performing a \"toby\" at a preliminary solo competition of the 2017 National Eisteddfod in Bodedern . It is generally accepted that Flemish weavers introduced clogs to the British Isles in the 13th century but the more recent description of the clog in Wales includes a leather upper and dates back to the industrial revolution. These are hardy shoes that can last up to 7 years for an individual in a low-income family. Tradition of clogging Clog dancing in Wales originates mostly from slate quarries and farmers also. In a film shot in 1959, Gwenyth Thomas, who revived the tradition in Porthmadog , credited its richness to the worldwide experiences of sailors who came to pick up slate from the Ffestiniog quarries. Workers would attempt to out-perform each other during work breaks by performing more extravagant and striking \"steps\" and \"tricks\" to impress their co-workers. The slate that was produced in the quarries could be used as a platform to clog dance and slate is still used even today in Eisteddfod competitions. Typically clog dancers prefer ash wood because it gives a clearer and more crisp sound however, these are also the least hardwearing. Clog dancing is the only unbroken dancing tradition in Wales following the discouragement of other forms of dance during the religious revivals of the 18th and 19th centuries. Stable lofts, taverns and fairs were also popular environments for clog dancing and competitive clog dancing, with the winners typically being men who performed steps or tricks which could not be replicated by others. There may have been a period where the step dance and the trick dance were separate competitions however in modern competition they are performed as one dance or routine which typically includes a handkerchief, broom and candle. It is likely that clog dancing survived with an unbroken tradition because it was easier to continue dancing as an individual on the hearth or stable loft. The travelling community in Wales are also associated with maintaining the tradition. The middle of the 20th century saw the revival of interest in clog dancing and significant dancing figures emerged such as Hywel Wood who was a traveller from Parc near Bala and another dancer named Caradog Pugh hailing from Llanuwchlyn. There are only occasional references to women dancing in literature. Huw Williams, a recent clog-dancing figure suggests that Welsh clog dancers pass on their skills by observation and emulation. Steps also have their own name although these can vary by individual and area. Dancing style Welsh clog dancing is unique and is not a revival, as it is danced in the style of the unbroken tradition.\" Welsh clog dancing is stylistically distinct from English clog dancing with new steps and \"tricks\" constantly being invented as part of Eisteddfod competitions. For example, extinguishing a candle, toby stepping (propelling the feet forward alternatively in a squat position), straddle jumps, handkerchief jumps, stepping and jumping over brooms are performed. Welsh clog dancing, especially solo dancing has evolved to become much more dynamic than English clog dancing. Usage Clog dancing is an integral part of both the local and national eisteddfod tradition in Wales. Competitions since the 1960s have extended to dancing duets and trios which meant that groups could recreate on stage the true tradition where one dancer was trying to out-dance the other. Group clogging has also become an integral part of the eisteddfodau and dancing tradition. Competition can be energetic with the dancers leaping over brooms as seen in the National Eisteddfod Male Welsh Clog Dancing Competition. Notable dancing groups include Natgarw Dancers hailing from the Pontypridd area and Talog dancers from Carmarthen. Both groups have enjoyed significant success in National Eisteddfod competitions. Nantgarw dancers have also had significant success in international competitions such as the Llangollen International Eisteddfod in Wales, Lorient Folk Festival in France and Mallorca World Folk Festival in Spain. Welsh clog dancing is still taught to children and adults to this day and has even been used as a fitness exercise course.

The testimony of an Afghan Police officer, appointed by officials of Hamid Karzai 's government, named Swar Khan , offered several details of Maja Ha Adrif's career during Hamid Karzai's government. Role in the appointment of Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan's interim leader In November 2001 a multiparty agreement, in Bonn , Germany , lead to the appointment of Hamid Karzai as leader of the Afghan Transitional Administration . The parties in Bonn included several of Afghanistan's militia leaders, commonly called \" warlords \". According to Swan Khan, Majah Ha Adrif was one of the Bonn attendees. Swar Khan testified Majah Ha Adrif had a picture of himself shaking hands with US President George W. Bush . Main article: Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan) Chief of Afghan Intelligence for Khost Swar Khan worked for a former anti-Taliban militia leader named Malem Jan Sorbari . He attributed his denunciation, and transportation to Guantanamo to bad blood triggered by a rivalry between the former militia leaders he worked under and Majah Ha Adrif. According to Swar Khan his immediate boss, Mustafa, had been appointed the Police Chief of Khost, while a different authority had appointed Majah Ha Adrif in charge of Afghan intelligence in Khost. Swar Khan told his Combatant Status Review Tribunal that Mustafa's forces fought with Majah Ha Adrif's forces over who had jurisdiction over the security of the areas surrounding the US bases in Khost. Many innocent people were killed during this fighting. Swar Khan said one of Majah Ha Adrif's subordinates, named Habib Noor, falsely denounced him, and triggered his capture by the American, due to the animosity arising from the jurisdictional dispute. Death According to Swar Khan, Majah Ha Adrif was shot at an American roadblock: \"Maja Han Adroft(ph) [ sic ] was very trusted by the Americans. He went with the Americans to the German city of Bonn, to a meeting. He has a picture with Bush and shook hands with Bush. In a checkpoint, he probably took money from someone.

{"id": "doc_random_097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Fine_Arts,_Boston", "text": "The Museum of Fine Arts (often abbreviated as MFA Boston or MFA ) is an art museum in Boston , Massachusetts. It is the 20th-largest art museum in the world, measured by public gallery area. It contains 8,161 paintings and more than 450,000 works of art, making it one of the most comprehensive collections in the Americas. With more than 1.2 million visitors a year, it is the 83rd-most-visited art museum in the world as of 2024 . Founded in 1870 in Copley Square , the museum moved to its current Fenway location in 1909. It is affiliated with the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts . History 1870\u20131907 The original Museum of Fine Arts building in Copley Square The Museum of Fine Arts was founded in 1870 and was initially located on the top floor of the Boston Athen\u00e6um . Most of its initial collection came from the Athen\u00e6um's Art Gallery. In 1876, the museum moved to a highly ornamented brick Gothic Revival building designed by John Hubbard Sturgis and Charles Brigham , noted for its massed architectural terracotta . It was located in Copley Square at Dartmouth and St. James Streets. It was built almost entirely of brick and terracotta, which was imported from England, with some stone about its base. After the MFA moved out in 1909, this original building was demolished, and the Copley Plaza Hotel (now the Fairmont Copley Plaza ) replaced it in 1912. During the early years of the museum, Charles Greely Loring , a former Union Army general, served as its first director, leading from 1876 to early 1902 when he resigned for health reasons. 1907\u20131999 New MFA building in the Fenway, c. \u20091913\u20131918 In 1907, plans were laid to build a new home for the museum on Huntington Avenue in Boston's Fenway\u2013Kenmore neighborhood, near the recently opened Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum . Museum trustees hired architect Guy Lowell to create a design for a museum that could be built in stages, as funding was obtained for each phase. Two years later, the first section of Lowell's neoclassical design was completed. It featured a 500-foot (150\u00a0m) fa\u00e7ade of granite and a grand rotunda . The museum moved to its new location in 1909. The second phase of construction built a wing along The Fens to house painting galleries. It was funded entirely by Maria Antoinette Evans Hunt, the wife of wealthy business magnate Robert Dawson Evans, and opened in 1915. From 1916 through 1925, the noted artist John Singer Sargent painted the frescoes that adorn the rotunda and the associated colonnades , using a young Black model, Thomas McKeller , as his inspiration for Apollo and the other Greek gods depicted in these murals. Rose Garden and Museum of Fine Arts, Fenway, June 14, 1934. The Decorative Arts Wing was built in 1928, and expanded in 1968. An addition designed by Hugh Stubbins and Associates was built in 1966\u20131970, and another expansion by The Architects Collaborative opened in 1976. The West Wing, now the Linde Family Wing for Contemporary Art, was designed by I. M. Pei and opened in 1981. This wing now houses the museum's cafe, restaurant, meeting rooms, classrooms, and a giftshop/bookstore, as well as large exhibition spaces. In 1978, the Asiatic Wing was closed because the lack of climate control was jeopardizing the collection. A new control system was contingent upon the completion of the West Wing, and the Asiatic Wing reopened in 1982. The Tenshin-En Japanese Garden designed by Kinsaku Nakane opened in 1988, and the Norma Jean Calderwood Garden Court and Terrace opened in 1997. 2000\u2013present The Shapiro Courtyard, which houses Dale Chihuly 's Lime Green Icicle Tower (right), is used to host large banquets and other events. In the mid-2000s, the museum launched a major effort to renovate and expand its facilities. In a seven-year fundraising campaign between 2001 and 2008 for a new wing, the endowment , and operating expenses, the museum managed to receive over $500 million, in addition to acquiring over $160 million worth of art. In 2007, the MFA announced its purchase of a nearby building then occupied by the Forsyth Institute , a dental and craniofacial research organization located at 140 Fenway . The original Beaux Arts building dates from around 1910, and was later expanded with a Brutalist annex building. The entire property comprised approximately 107,000 square feet (9,900\u00a0m 2 ) on 1.6 acres (0.65\u00a0ha) of land, located across the street from the main MFA building. As of 2023 , the building is leased to nearby Northeastern University . During the Great Recession , the museum's annual budget was trimmed by $1.5 million. The museum increased revenues by organizing traveling exhibitions, which included a loan exhibition sent to the for-profit Bellagio in Las Vegas in exchange for $1 million. In 2011, Moody's Investors Service calculated that the museum had over $180 million in outstanding debt. However, the agency cited growing attendance, a large endowment, and positive cash flow as reasons to believe that the museum's finances would become stable in the near future. In 2011, the museum put eight paintings by Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley, Gauguin, and others on sale at Sotheby's , bringing in a total of $21.6 million, to pay for Man at His Bath by Gustave Caillebotte at a cost reported to be more than $15 million. The new Art of the Americas wing is integrated with the neoclassical facade of the main building A renovation included the new Art of the Americas Wing, featuring artwork from North, South, and Central America. In 2006, the groundbreaking ceremonies took place. The new wing and adjoining Ruth and Carl J. Shapiro Family Courtyard (a bright, cavernous interior space) were designed in a restrained, contemporary style by the London-based architectural firm Foster and Partners , under the directorship of Thomas T. Difraia and Childs Bertman Tseckares Architects (CBT) . The landscape architecture firm Gustafson Guthrie Nichol redesigned the Huntington Avenue and Fenway entrances, gardens, access roads, and interior courtyards. The wing opened on November 20, 2010, with free admission to the public. Mayor Thomas Menino declared it \"Museum of Fine Arts Day\", and more than 13,500 visitors attended the opening. The 12,000-square-foot (1,100\u00a0m 2 ) glass-enclosed courtyard now features a 42.5-foot (13.0\u00a0m) high glass sculpture, titled the Lime Green Icicle Tower , by Dale Chihuly . In 2014, the Art of the Americas Wing was recognized for its high architectural achievement by the award of the Harleston Parker Medal , by the Boston Society of Architects . In 2015, the museum renovated Tenshin-en , its Japanese garden . In 2015, the museum renovated its outdoors Japanese garden , Tenshin-en. The garden, which originally opened in 1988, had been designed by Japanese professor Kinsaku Nakane. The garden's kabukimon -style entrance gate was built by Chris Hall of Massachusetts, using traditional Japanese carpentry techniques. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic , the museum was closed from March 12, 2020, through September 25, 2020. To recover from the drop in attendance caused by the pandemic, a new logo and branding campaign were announced in September 2022, along with renewed community outreach efforts. These changes were announced in tandem with the opening of the traveling exhibition of an official portrait of former US president Barack Obama by Kehinde Wiley and the accompanying portrait of Michelle Obama by Amy Sherald , both on loan from the National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC. In November 2020 a significant number of MFA employees voted to unionize due to a long history of unaddressed issues related to workplace conditions and compensation inequities. The workers unionized with the local chapter of the United Auto Workers . After over 96% of the union agreed in a vote, MFA staff went on a strike for the first time on November 17, 2021. Union representatives cited unresponsive engagement from MFA management over multiple issues including stagnant wages, job security, and workplace diversity, as the reason for the strike. The union pointed out that employee wages had been frozen for two years, and that management had so far only offered a 1.75% percent raise over the course of four years. Union representatives contrasted this with MFA director Matthew Teitelbaum's salary which, at nearly US$1 million, was almost 19 times larger than the average MFA worker. Collection The \" Bunworth harp \", a large cl\u00e1irseach made in 1734, is part of the collection of musical instruments Cyrus Dallin 's Appeal to the Great Spirit (1908) stands outside the museum's main entrance facing Huntington Avenue. The Museum of Fine Arts possesses materials from a wide variety of art movements and cultures. The museum also maintains a large online database with information on over 346,000 items from its collection, accompanied with digitized images. Online search is freely available through the Internet. The museum also maintains the Conservation and Art Materials Encyclopedia Online, (CAMEO) a database that \"compiles, defines, and disseminates technical information on the distinct collection of terms, materials, and techniques used in the fields of art conservation and historic preservation\". CAMEO uses MediaWiki . Highlights Some highlights of the collection include: Ancient Egyptian artifacts including sculptures, sarcophagi , and jewelry dating back to approximately 6500 BCE to 600 CE, which were primarily obtained through excavations conducted by George A. Reisner in Egypt and Sudan between 1905 and 1942. The Nubian arts, including Kerma pottery, colossal royal statues of Napatan kings, jewels, and imports from Greece and Rome, are represented in the collection of Nubian art. Dutch Golden Age painting , including 113 works given in 2017 by collectors Rose-Marie and Eijk van Otterloo and Susan and Matthew Weatherbie. The gift includes works from 76 artists, as well as the Haverkamp-Begemann Library, a collection of more than 20,000 books, donated by the van Otterloos. The donors also established in 2022 a scholarly institute at the museum, the Center for Netherlandish Art, which houses the library and many of the paintings. French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works by artists such as Paul Gauguin , \u00c9douard Manet , Pierre-Auguste Renoir , Edgar Degas , Claude Monet , Camille Pissarro , Vincent van Gogh , and Paul C\u00e9zanne 18th- and 19th-century American art, including many works by John Singleton Copley , Winslow Homer , John Singer Sargent , and Gilbert Stuart Cyrus Dallin 's 1908 statue, Appeal to the Great Spirit , is prominently exhibited on the lawn at the museum's entrance. The Chinese collections feature a selection of imperial ceramics , ancient bronzes, monumental Buddhist sculptures, and 20th-century and contemporary artwork, spanning nearly every era of Chinese history. The collection of Chinese paintings is particularly noteworthy, with numerous masterpieces from the Song and Yuan dynasties. The largest collection of Japanese artworks under one roof in the world outside Japan The Hartley Collection of almost 10,000 British illustrated books, prints and drawings from the late 19th century The Rothschild Collection, including over 130 objects from the Austrian branch of the Rothschild family . Donated by Bettina Burr and other heirs The Rockefeller collection of Native American work The Linde Family Wing for Contemporary Art includes works by Kathy Butterly , Mona Hatoum , Jenny Holzer , Karen LaMonte , Ken Price , Martin Puryear , Doris Salcedo , and Andy Warhol . A collection of over 1,100 historical music instruments, with selected items displayed in a dedicated music room, with occasional talks, live demonstrations, and concerts. Japanese art Red Fuji , from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji by Hokusai , c. \u20091830 \u20131832 The collection of Japanese art at the Museum of Fine Arts is the largest in the world outside of Japan. Anne Nishimura Morse, the William and Helen Pounds Senior Curator of Japanese Art, oversees 100,000 total items that include 4,000 Japanese paintings, 5,000 ceramic pieces, and over 30,000 ukiyo-e prints. The base of this collection was assembled in the late 19th century through the efforts of four men, Ernest Fenollosa , Kakuzo Okakura , William Sturgis Bigelow , and Edward Sylvester Morse , each of whom had spent time in Japan and admired Japanese art. Their combined donations account for up to 75 percent of the current collection. In 1890, the Museum of Fine Arts became the first museum in the United States to establish a collection and appoint a curator specifically for Japanese art. Another part of this collection is a number of Buddhist statues . In the later Meiji era of Japan, around the turn of the 20th century, government policy deemphasizing Buddhism in favor of Shintoism and financial pressures on temples resulted in a number of Buddhist statues being sold to private collectors. Some of these statutes came into the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts. Today, these statues are the subject of preservation and restoration efforts, which have been at times viewable by the public in special exhibits. In recent years, the museum has also collected a number of works by contemporary Japanese artists. In 2011, they acquired Zetsu no. 8 (\u7d76), the largest work in ceramicist Jun Nishida 's Zetsu (\u7d76) series. Also important for this collection is the exhibition of its items in Japan. From 1999 to 2018, regular exchange of items was conducted between the Museum of Fine Arts and its sister museum, the now-closed Nagoya/Boston Museum of Fine Arts . In 2012, the traveling exhibition Japanese Masterpieces from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston visited the Japanese cities of Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and Fukuoka, and was well received. In 2023 the museum held an exhibition entitled \"Hokusai: Inspiration and Influence\" celebrating the origins, works, and cultural impact of Japanese artist Hokusai . Chinese art Nine Dragons (detail), Chen Rong, Chinese, Southern Song dynasty, dated 1244. Handscroll, ink and color on paper, 46.8 \u00d7 1495.6 cm. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Francis Gardner Curtis Fund, 17.1697. The Chinese art collection at the Museum of Fine Arts is one of the finest outside East Asia, with particularly strong holdings in paintings, ceramics, and Buddhist sculpture. The collection includes objects from nearly every era of Chinese history, from Neolithic tomb artifacts to contemporary works. The museum's Chinese paintings collection is internationally renowned. Highlights include the Thirteen Emperors scroll from the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907), considered the oldest court painting in existence, as well as Court Ladies Preparing Newly Woven Silk (early 12th century, attributed to Emperor Huizong) and Nine Dragons (first half of the 13th century, Chen Rong ). The ceramics collection features important imperial stonewares and porcelain, including a rare Ru ware dish from the Northern Song dynasty, one of fewer than one hundred such pieces still extant in the world. In 2018, the museum received the largest and most significant gift of Chinese paintings and calligraphy in its history: the Wan-go H. C. Weng Collection. Encompassing 130 paintings, 31 works of calligraphy, 18 ink rubbings, and 4 textiles, the gift spans 13 centuries and five imperial dynasties, with particularly rich representation of art from the Ming (1368\u20131644) and Qing (1644\u20131911) eras. The core of this collection was assembled in the 19th century by Weng Tonghe (1830\u20131904), a preeminent scholar who served as tutor to two of the last emperors of the Qing dynasty. Restitution claims In April 2024, the museum donated several 14th-century Buddhist \u015aar\u012bra relics that were in its collection since 1939 to the Jogye Order as part of an agreement to repatriate artifacts taken from Korea during the Japanese Occupation . The relics will be transferred to the Heoam Temple in Yangju , South Korea, where they are believed to have originated. In November 2025, the museum returned two of its Benin Bronzes to Nigeria. Libraries The main library was formerly located nearby on Massachusetts Avenue at Horticultural Hall . The libraries at the Museum of Fine Arts consist of a main library, eight curatorial departmental libraries, and the Center for Netherlandish Art Library. Collectively they hold over 450,000 items, including 60,000 art auction catalogs, and 150,000 periodicals and ephemera. The main branch, the William Morris Hunt Memorial Library, is named after the noted American artist. In 2021, the main library moved after 18 years at Horticultural Hall , two stops away on the MBTA Green Line . The new entrance for the library is on the first floor of the museum, near Sharf Information Center, in front of the Nina Saunders Suite. About one-quarter of the collection was planned to be housed on the third floor of the museum, along with the book conservation facilities, with the remainder stored off-site. The main library had been open to the public, and the catalog could be searched online through the Fenway Libraries Online (FLO). It is open to researchers for two three-hour sessions per week, but only by appointment requested two weeks in advance, and subject to approval. Exhibitions organized by the library staff in coordination with the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts have been debuted two to three times per year. Community relations The MFA also has a longstanding initiative within the Community Arts program called the Community Artist Initiative Artist Project , where the museum invites a Lead Artist to spend nine months creating works with youth from twelve after-school community organizations in the Boston area. The Artist and the children create a collaborative work of art inspired by the Museum's encyclopedic collection, and the completed project is exhibited in the Edward H. Linde Gallery (168) in the Linde Family Wing for Contemporary Art at the MFA. The MFA offers accessibility accommodations for visitors who may be visually, audibly, or physically impaired. Special programming and tours are available for blind, ASL -fluent, cognitively-impaired, autistic , and medically assisted guests. In the spring of 2019 it installed new signage for its restrooms , in an effort towards \"restroom accessibility for people of all genders and abilities.\" The MFA publicly apologized in May 2019 after African-American and mixed-race 12- and 13-year-old visitors were allegedly targeted by employees and told \"No food, no drink, and no watermelon\", which is considered a racial slur in the US. A museum spokesperson said that the warning was actually \"no water bottles\", but conceded that there was no way of definitively proving what was actually said. Regardless, all museum staff dealing with school groups were to be retrained in interactions with their guests. The MFA also concluded that two of its members had been deliberately racist, and permanently banned them from visiting its grounds. In 2019 the MFA debuted its newly renamed \"Indigenous Peoples' Day\" (formerly Columbus Day ) celebrations, with a focus on Native American art and culture. The events included special displays related to Cyrus Dallin 's 1908 Appeal to the Great Spirit , a popular and sometimes controversial sculpture of a Native American warrior located in front of the Huntington Avenue main entrance since 1912. Community comments and feedback concerning the monumental artwork were solicited and displayed. Earlier, in March 2019, the MFA had held a special public symposium to discuss the historical background and present-day significance of the sculpture. In 2020 the MFA had planned to offer 11 annual Community Celebrations, featuring free admission for all visitors, and special events such as dance performances, music, tours, craft demonstrations, and hands-on art making. This series included day-long Martin Luther King Jr. Day , Lunar New Year , Memorial Day , Highland Street Foundation Free Fun Friday, and Indigenous Peoples' Day celebrations. In addition, on Wednesday evenings, which were already free from 4pm to 10pm, special celebrations of Nowruz , Juneteenth , Latinx Heritage Night , ASL Night, Diwali , and Hanukkah were featured. To commemorate its 150th anniversary, the MFA offered a free one-year family membership to anyone who attended one of its special Community Celebrations or MFA Late Nite programs during 2020. This \"First Year Free Membership\" program was available to anyone who had not previously been a member of the museum. The 150th year exhibitions included major shows and events featuring art by women and minority artists. Special exhibitions The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, hosts special exhibitions consisting of items borrowed from other museums. These limited time events extend for several months and there are typically three exhibitions taking place concurrently since at least 1996. The collection topics of the special exhibits are divided into 13 categories: Africa and Oceania; Americas; Ancient Egypt, Nubia and the near East; Ancient Greece and Rome; Asia; Contemporary Art ; Europe; Jewelry; Judaica; Musical Instruments; Photography; Prints and Drawings; and Textile and Fashion Arts. Most special exhibitions take place at the following galleries: Edward and Nancy Roberts Family Gallery, Linde Family Wing for Contemporary Art, Ann and Graham Gund Gallery, Edward H. Linde Gallery. The exhibitions are usually open to public with a variety of ticket prices. Members of MFA, Boston can also enjoy free admission to any special exhibitions. Philip Guston Now Philip Guston Now is an exhibition organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the National Gallery of Art, Washington ; the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston ; and Tate Modern , London. This show is also considered as America's most controversial art exhibition, as of May 2022. Its controversies are mainly due to much of his work addressing and confronting topics such as white supremacy , racism, anti-Semitism , and violence It was originally planned to open in June 2020, but due to nationwide protests for racial equality , it was postponed to open at May. 1, 2022.

{"id": "doc_random_099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pramlintide", "text": "Pramlintide (trade name Symlin ) is an injectable amylin analogue drug for diabetes (both type 1 and 2), developed by Amylin Pharmaceuticals (now a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca ). Pramlintide is sold as an acetate salt. Pharmacology Pramlintide is an analogue of amylin , a small peptide hormone that is released into the bloodstream by the \u03b2 cells of the pancreas along with insulin after a meal. Like insulin, amylin is completely absent in individuals with Type I diabetes. In synergy with endogenous amylin, pramlintide aids in the regulation of blood glucose by slowing gastric emptying , promoting satiety via hypothalamic receptors (different receptors than for GLP-1 ), and inhibiting inappropriate secretion of glucagon , a catabolic hormone that opposes the effects of insulin and amylin. Pramlintide also has effects in raising the acute first-phase insulin response threshold following a meal. Both a reduction in glycated hemoglobin and weight loss have been shown in insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes taking pramlintide as an adjunctive therapy. Research Applications In the research field, pramlintide has been experimented with and used as a potential treatment drug. Pramlintide has demonstrated its ability to decrease amyloid beta plaques in Alzheimer's disease mouse models. Approval Pramlintide has been approved on 3/16/2005 by the FDA, for use by type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients who use insulin. (subscription required) Pramlintide allows patients to use less insulin, lowers average blood sugar levels, and substantially reduces what otherwise would be a large unhealthy rise in blood sugar that occurs in diabetics right after eating. Apart from insulin analogs, pramlintide is the only drug approved by the FDA to lower blood sugar in type 1 diabetics since insulin in the early 1920s. Design and structure Since native human amylin is highly amyloidogenic and potentially toxic, the strategy for designing pramlintide was to substitute residues from rat amylin, which is less amyloidogenic but presumably retains clinical activity. Proline residues are known to be structure-breaking residues, so these were directly grafted into the human sequence. Despite its enhanced stability compared to human amylin, however, pramlintide is still able to organize into amyloid material. Amino acid sequences: Pramlintide is a positively charged protein.

{"id": "doc_random_101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Campeche", "text": "Same-sex marriage has been legal in Campeche since 20 May 2016. In April 2016, Governor Alejandro Moreno C\u00e1rdenas introduced a same-sex marriage bill to the Congress of Campeche , which approved it on 10 May by 34 votes to 1. The law entered into force 10 days later. Campeche was the sixth Mexican state to legalize same-sex marriage. Previously, Congress had enacted a law permitting same-sex civil unions in 2013, which provided several of the rights and benefits of marriage . Legal history Civil unions On 11 April 2013, the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) introduced a measure to legalize civil unions ( Spanish : sociedad civil de convivencia , pronounced [sosje\u02c8\u00f0a\u00f0 si\u02c8\u03b2il de kombi\u02c8\u03b2ensja] ; Yucatec Maya : l\u00e1ak\u2019 bix m\u00faul kuxtalil , pronounced [l\u00e1\u02d0k\u0294 bi\u0283 m\u00fa\u02d0l ku\u0283ta\u02c8lil] ). The bill was passed unanimously by the Congress of Campeche on 20 December 2013 and, while it applies to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples, it does not provide couples with the same rights, benefits and obligations as marriage . A notable distinction is that civil unions are not registered with the civil registry but rather with the Public Registry of Property and Commerce ( Registro P\u00fablico de la Propiedad y de Comercio ). On 11 August 2015, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation ruled in a 9\u20131 decision that Campeche's ban on same-sex couples adopting children was unconstitutional. The court struck down article 19 of the civil union law, which had outlawed adoption by same-sex partners, and set a constitutional precedent that all similar bans in Mexico were unconstitutional. Children's rights were cited as the main reason for the court decision. President of the Supreme Court Luis Mar\u00eda Aguilar Morales wrote that \"[he] [saw] no problem for a child to be adopted in a society of co-existence, which has precisely this purpose. Are we going to prefer to have children in the streets, which according to statistics exceed 100,000? We attend, of course, and perhaps with the same intensity or more, to the interests of the child.\" On 23 September 2016, the Supreme Court finalised the ruling in the adoption case against Campeche and issued a nationwide jurisprudence which binds all lower court judges to rule in favor of same-sex couples seeking adoption and parental rights. Campeche's ban on same-sex adoption was lifted on 26 September. Same-sex marriage On 31 March 2014, a lesbian couple, Mar\u00eda Estrada Mu\u00f1oz and Faride Cabrera Can, applied for a marriage license in San Francisco de Campeche . Officials rejected their application on the basis that same-sex couples could only enter into civil unions and could not legally marry. The Supreme Court held oral arguments , and declared the ban on same-sex marriages unconstitutional in July 2014. It permitted the plaintiff couple to marry and ordered Congress to modify the Civil Code to allow same-sex marriages. The conservative National Action Party (PAN) said it would abide by the ruling. The couple married on 30 August 2014. In September 2014, the PRD announced that eight same-sex couples, five from San Francisco de Campeche and three from Ciudad del Carmen , had sought amparos granting them the right to marry. It added that analysis of changing the marriage statutes was in progress. On 4 April 2016, Governor Alejandro Moreno C\u00e1rdenas submitted a same-sex marriage bill to the Congress of Campeche. Shortly thereafter, the two largest parties in the state, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the National Action Party, announced their support for the bill. Deputies said the bill would likely be voted on sometime in May 2016. On 10 May, Congress voted 34\u20131 to approve the same-sex marriage bill. It was published in the official state gazette on 16 May and came into effect on 20 May. Article 157 of the Civil Code was amended to read: Marriage is the union of two people who live a shared life, in which both partners must ensure mutual respect, equality, and support. Marriage is contracted by the authorities of the Civil Registry as set out in this Code and in accordance with the formalities it requires. In June 2016, Adriana \u00c1viles \u00c1viles was expelled from her party, the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), over her decision to vote against the legislation. On 14 June, opponents of same-sex marriage filed an injunction against the new law, arguing that \"it was unfairly imposed on Campechanos\", and refuted allegations of homophobia . On 7 July, a federal judge ruled in favor of a stay . A spokesperson for Congress said the judge's injunction only bars the plaintiffs from marrying a partner of the same sex. According to the President of Congress, Ram\u00f3n M\u00e9ndez Lanz, same-sex couples can continue to marry in the state. Native Mexicans While many Indigenous cultures historically practiced polygamy to some extent, there are no records of same-sex marriages being performed in these cultures in the way they are commonly defined in Western legal systems. However, many Indigenous communities recognize identities and relationships that may be placed on the LGBT spectrum. The Yucatec Maya recognized certain forms of institutionalised same-sex relations. Some shamans engaged in homosexual acts with their patients, and priests engaged in ritualized homosexual acts with their gods. Anthropologist Walter Lee Williams wrote with respect to the Yucatec Maya: \"After my arrival in Yucat\u00e1n, I soon learned that the society provides a de facto acceptance of same-sex relations for males. It did not take long to establish contacts, and my informants suggested that a large majority of the male population is at certain times sexually active with other males. This usually occurs in the years between thirteen and thirty, when sexual desire is strongest, but it also involves men older than that. Marriage to a woman does not seem to have much effect on the occurrence and amount of homosexual behavior.\" Carvings, rituals and stories were explicit about sexual diversity. Marriage statistics The following table shows the number of same-sex marriages performed in Campeche since legalization in 2016 as reported by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography . Figures for 2020 are lower than previous years because of the restrictions in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic . Public opinion A 2017 opinion poll conducted by the Strategic Communication Office ( Gabinete de Comunicaci\u00f3n Estrat\u00e9gica ) found that 42% of Campeche residents supported same-sex marriage, one of the lowest in the nation, while 55% were opposed. According to a 2018 survey by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, 56% of the Campeche public opposed same-sex marriage, the third highest in Mexico after Chiapas (59%) and Tabasco (56.5%).

{"id": "doc_random_102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reset_button_technique", "text": "The reset button technique (based on the idea of status quo ante ) is a plot device for interrupting continuity in works of fiction. The reset button device is used to return all characters and situations to the status quo prior to some major change. It can be employed in the middle of a program to negate some portion of what came before. It is often used in science fiction television series, animated series , soap operas , and comic books . The reset button technique accommodates dramatic changes to characters and the fictional universe that might otherwise invalidate the show's premise with respect to future episodes or other plot details. For example, writers may use the device to improve the audience's experience of the lead character's death , which is usually impossible without effectively ending the work or significantly altering its course. One-off use The effective use of this device in productions where it is not typically featured relies heavily on the audience's suspension of disbelief until the precise moment when the reset button technique is employed. The successful execution of this technique needs the introduction of plot developments that significantly alter the course of the show, without indicating that continuity will be disrupted. Often employed as a plot twist , the reset button technique serves to undo all the preceding events of an episode. This device draws inspiration from science fiction and metaphysical concepts and is frequently included in those genres. Examples of the reset button technique include dream sequences , alternate-history flashbacks , parallel universes , alternate realities, alternate timelines, daydreams , time travel , and hallucinations . In one trope that uses this technique (typically in science fiction or fantasy), a character will find themselves in a situation that seems familiar, but during the episode, some things seem odd. Then one or more major events happen, such as the death of a lead character. By the end of the episode or story arc , the character realizes that they have been placed in a copy of their normal surroundings, usually to try to obtain information from them, and that the mastermind behind the plan made a few mistakes in fashioning the copied environment. One popular example of the reset button technique is the 1986 season premiere of Dallas in which it is revealed that Bobby Ewing 's death in the previous season was merely a dream in the mind of one of the characters. This was parodied in the \" Da Boom \" episode of Family Guy . In comics , the Spider-Man storyline Spider-Man: One More Day undid the marriage of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson , drawing criticism due to the continuity issues, with some critics even comparing it to Dallas . However, when used appropriately, it can be devastating in terms of its effect. Near the end of the series finale of Newhart , innkeeper Dick Loudon (portrayed by Bob Newhart ) is struck on the head and knocked unconscious. The scene switches abruptly to Dr. Bob Hartley, the character Newhart portrayed in his earlier series, The Bob Newhart Show , waking up in bed next to his wife Emily (portrayed by Suzanne Pleshette ). Hartley describes the strange dream he has just had about running a Vermont inn, which Emily blames on the Japanese food he ate before going to bed. The entirety of Newhart is thus established to be part of Hartley's dream. Use as a frequent plot device In many series, the reset button trope is used as a standard, and frequently explicit, plot device. Implicit usage of the technique can be seen in episodic fiction, such as when the results of episodes regularly cause what would seem to be massive changes in the status of characters and their world; however, it is understood by the audience that subsequent episodes will not consider such events. An example is South Park , in which the character of Kenny dies in almost every episode in early seasons, only to reappear in future episodes without explanation. The Simpsons is one show that generally uses this technique, while occasionally introducing lasting continuity changes. Creator Matt Groening referred to this flexibility as a \"rubber band reality\". Shows using the reset-button technique sometimes point out, as a form of self-referential humor , their own use of the device. Alluding to the trope, the CBBC television series Hounded features a literal reset button that, at the end of each episode, rewinds the entire day's events back to the beginning.

History and description Located at the site of the former Palazzo Orienti, in 1844 a group of citizens proposed erecting a theater at this site. The project stalled, and the architect Virginio Vespignani designed and built the present structure. The theater was inaugurated on 19 May 1866 with the opera La Favorita by Donizetti . Initially the theater was dedicated initially to the muses Talia, Melpomene , and Euterpe , but in 1922 the city renamed the theater to honor two brother and fellow citizens who had gained international reputation as musicians and composers, Marino and Luigi Mancinelli . A description of the theater in 1883 noted the entry salon was frescoed by Annibale Angelini . Some medallions were frescoed by Cesare Fracassini with portraits of famed Italian opera composers: Rossini, Bellini, Donizzetti, Verdi, Mercadante, and Pacini; poets: Metastasio, Alfieri, Goldoni, and Romani: and choreographers Rota and Vigan\u00f2. Fracassini also frescoed the three muses in the proscenium. The sipario (theater curtain) was painted by Fracassini, depicting the expulsion by Belisarius of the Goths from Orvieto in 538. Closed for some years, in 1993 a restoration of the interior was completed and the theater is the venue for drama, opera, dance and other spectacles.

{"id": "doc_random_106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Launch_System", "text": "Proposed NLS family of launch vehicles. The National Launch System (or New Launch System) was a study authorized in 1991 by President George H. W. Bush to outline alternatives to the Space Shuttle for access to Earth orbit. Shortly thereafter, NASA asked Lockheed Missiles and Space , McDonnell Douglas , and TRW to perform a ten-month study. A series of launch vehicles was proposed, based around the proposed Space Transportation Main Engine (STME) liquid-fuel rocket engine . The STME was to be a simplified, expendable version of the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME). The NLS-1 was the largest of three proposed vehicles and would have used a modified Space Shuttle external tank for its core stage. The tank would have fed liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen to four STMEs attached to the bottom of the tank. A payload or second stage would have fit atop the core stage, and two detachable Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters would have been mounted on the sides of the core stage as on the Shuttle. Period illustrations suggest that much larger rockets than NLS-1 were contemplated, using multiples of the NLS-1 core stage. Program cancellation A National Launch System engine being test-fired at NASA's Stennis Space Center The NLS program did not venture beyond the planning stages and did not survive the Presidency of Bill Clinton , which started in January 1993. In 1992, Daniel Goldin was selected to replace Vice Admiral Richard H. Truly as NASA administrator . Goldin championed the motto, \"faster, better, cheaper,\" which may not have fit the ambitious NLS vision. A NASA history from 1998 says that reusable single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) rockets and space planes such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-X and the Lockheed Martin X-33 seemed attainable and represented smaller, simpler alternatives to the sprawling Shuttle program. The NLS, by contrast, was more of a continuation of the Shuttle legacy. By the beginning of the Clinton administration, the expensive Space Shuttle and planned Space Station Freedom programs had enough momentum to continue, and the SSTO projects showed enough promise to fund. There was no money left for another big program such as the NLS. Legacy In 1994, the United States Air Force Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program led to the development of the Delta IV . Rocketdyne realized that they would need a powerful, simple engine for the proposed liquid-fueled Common Booster Core (CBC). NLS research on the STME, a simpler SSME, served as a starting point for the greatly simplified RS-68 that powered the Delta IV EELV rocket. The Delta IV Heavy rocket is composed of three CBCs. NASA later developed a very similar launch vehicle to NLS-1 called the Space Launch System , as part of its Artemis program to return astronauts to the Moon in the mid-2020s. The similarities include a lengthened Shuttle external tank-like core stage, four engines meant as expendable versions of the SSME, and large solid rocket boosters (with five segments instead of four).

{"id": "doc_random_107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop_on_Pop", "text": "Hop on Pop is a 1963 children's picture book by Dr. Seuss (Theodor Seuss Geisel), published as part of the Random House Beginner Books series. The book is subtitled \"The Simplest Seuss for Youngest Use\", and is designed to introduce basic phonics concepts to children. History One of Geisel's manuscript drafts for the book contained the lines, \"When I read I am smart / I always cut whole words apart. / Con Stan Tin O Ple , Tim Buk Too / Con Tra Cep Tive , Kan Ga Roo \". Geisel had included the contraceptive reference to ensure that publisher Bennett Cerf was reading the manuscript . Cerf did notice the line, and the poem was changed to the following: \"My father / can read / big words, too. / Like... / Constantinople / and / Timbuktu\". Reception A popular choice of elementary school teachers and children's librarians, Hop on Pop ranked sixteenth on Publishers Weekly 's 2001 list of the all-time best-selling hardcover books for children. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association reported the book as being No. \u00a0 67 on their list of \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\". One of Hop on Pop \u2019s most notable advocates is former United States First Lady Laura Bush , who listed the book as her favourite in a 2006 interview with The Wall Street Journal . Bush said this book with its illustrations and rhymes delighted her and her husband George and their daughters Barbara and Jenna after reading it. In 2013, an official complaint was made to the Toronto Public Library , which claimed that the book \"encouraged children to use violence against their fathers\". The library decided against removing the book, finding it a humorous and well-loved children's book designed to engage children while teaching them reading skills.

{"id": "doc_random_109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Chloroindole-3-acetic_acid", "text": "4-Chloroindole-3-acetic acid ( 4-Cl-IAA ) is an organic compound that functions as a plant hormone . Synopsis It is a member of the class of compounds known as auxins and a chlorinated analogue of the more common indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) auxin. 4-Cl-IAA is found in the seeds of a variety of plants, particularly legumes such as peas and broad beans. In one study it is written that the substance is \"mainly found in reproductive structures\" and \"is thought to be restricted to members of the leguminous tribe Fabeae , specifically \"the genera Vicia , Pisum , Lathyrus , Lens , and Vavilovia \". In Pisum sativum , 4-Cl-IAA biosynthesis diverges from IAA biosynthesis when the amino acid tryptophan is chlorinated to form 4-chlorotryptophan (4-Cl-Trp); the biosynthesis of 4-Cl-IAA then precedes parallel to that of IAA. Engvild hypothesized in 1996 that 4-Cl-IAA may be a \"death hormone\" that maturing seeds use to trigger death of the parent plant by mobilizing nutrients to be stored in the seed. Lam et al found the substance in the seeds of Medicago truncatula , Melilotus indicus , and three species of Trifolium . References ^ Reinecke, Dennis M.

For other storms of the same name, see List of storms named Fran . Hurricane Fran caused extensive damage in the United States in early September 1996. The sixth named storm , fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season , Fran developed from a tropical wave near Cape Verde on August 23. Due to nearby Hurricane Edouard , the depression remained disorganized as it tracked westward, though it eventually intensified into Tropical Storm Fran on August 27. While heading west-northwestward, Fran steadily strengthened into a hurricane on August 29, but weakened back to a tropical storm on the following day. On August 31, Fran quickly re-intensified into a hurricane. By September 2, Fran began to parallel the islands of the Bahamas and slowly curved north-northwestward. Early on September 5, Fran peaked as a 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) Category 3 hurricane . Thereafter, Fran weakened slightly, before it made landfall near Cape Fear , North Carolina early on September 6. The storm rapidly weakened inland and was only a tropical depression later that day. Eventually, Fran curved east-northeastward and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Ontario early on September 9. In Florida, high tides capsized a boat with five people aboard, though all were rescued. No significant effects were reported in Georgia . The outer bands of Fran produced high winds and light to moderate rainfall in South Carolina . As a result, numerous trees and powerlines were downed, which damaged cars, left over 63,000 people without electricity. Large waves in North Carolina caused significant coastal flooding in some cities. Overall, 27 fatalities and $5\u00a0billion (1996 USD) in damage were attributed to Fran. Fran is also the most recent hurricane to make landfall in the Carolinas as a major hurricane .

Not long after moving over water, convective banding features formed around a developing area of low pressure . Ships in the vicinity of the system confirmed that a surface circulation had formed later that day. After further development, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories on the system around 8:00\u00a0am EDT on August\u00a023, designating it as Tropical Depression Six. At this time, the depression was situated to the southeast of the Cape Verde Islands . Over the following several days, little development took place as the system moved westward at 17\u00a0mph (27\u00a0km/h). The westward motion and lack of development were attributed to the low-level inflow from Hurricane Edouard located roughly 850\u00a0mi (1,370\u00a0km) west-northwest of the depression. By August\u00a026, the depression had become significantly disorganized, prompting the NHC to issue their initial final advisory on the system. Despite this, the following day, satellite imagery depicted an improved circulation, leading to the re-issuance of advisories. However, post-storm analysis indicated that the system maintained tropical depression status during the 24\u2011hour span. During the afternoon of August\u00a027, the depression intensified further, becoming a tropical storm and receiving the name Fran. At this time, Tropical Storm Fran was located about 1,000\u00a0mi (1,600\u00a0km) east of the Lesser Antilles . Following a similar track as Edouard, the newly named storm maintained a west-northwest track while gaining strength. Hurricane Fran passing north of Hispaniola on September 2 Following the development of deep convection around Fran's center of circulation on August\u00a029, the NHC upgraded it to a Category 1 hurricane , the lowest ranking on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale , with winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h). However, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm on August\u00a030 as it became less organized, possibly due to an interaction with Hurricane Edouard to the north. During this time, the forward motion of the storm significantly decreased and it took a more northwestward track. However, this weakening was short-lived and Fran re-attained hurricane status the following day as Edouard moved towards the Mid-Atlantic coastline . The storm also resumed its west-northwest movement as a subtropical ridge to the north strengthened. Infrared image of Fran making landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina on September\u00a05 Gradual reintensification took place for the first several days of September, with Fran attaining winds of 90\u00a0mph (145\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a03. By this point, the storm began to develop an eye and a more rapid phase of strengthening took place. Early the next day, Fran attained Category 3 intensity as its maximum sustained winds increased to 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). A more northwesterly track also began to appear as it approached the Bahamas. Passing roughly 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) east of the Bahamas, Fran attained its peak intensity on September\u00a05 with winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 946 mbar (hPa; 27.94\u00a0inHg). The eye of Fran was roughly 29\u00a0mi (47\u00a0km) in diameter at this time. As a large hurricane, the storm's forward motion increased as it moved northwest towards The Carolinas . Around 7:30\u00a0 PM EDT on Thursday, September\u00a05, the center of Hurricane Fran made landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina with sustained winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). Once overland, the storm began to rapidly weaken, degrading to a tropical storm within 12\u00a0hours. As the weakening storm moved through Virginia, the NHC further downgraded it to a tropical depression. Continuing on a northwestern track, the remnants of Fran persisted as a tropical depression through September\u00a08, at which time it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over southern Ontario . After completing this transition, Fran turned northeastward and tracked near the Canadian-United States border before being absorbed by a frontal system on September\u00a010. Preparations Lesser Antilles and the Bahamas As Hurricane Fran passed to the north of the Lesser Antilles on August 29, a hurricane watch was issued for the northernmost of the islands between Antigua and Saint Martin . However, as the hurricane weakened and pulled away from the islands to the northwest, the watch was discontinued. At the same time, a hurricane watch and a tropical storm warning was declared for the central Bahamas . On September 3, the hurricane watch was extended to include the northern Bahamas and a hurricane warning was declared for the northwestern islands. All watches for the Bahamas were cancelled on September 4. No preparations were taken by the government of the Bahamas in anticipation of Fran. Florida Early in its span, Hurricane Fran was forecast to heavily impact Florida, and multiple watches and warnings were issued for the state as Hurricane Fran neared the United States. As the hurricane progressively moved further to the north, watches and warnings imposed on Florida continued to move further north along the coast. On September 4, a tropical storm warning was issued, but only from Brunswick, Georgia to Flagler Beach, Florida , located in the northern parts of the state. All watches and warnings on the state were discontinued by September 5. Before the hurricane neared the coast, civil defense authorities conducted statewide conference calls in order to create preliminary plans in case Fran caused impacts on Florida. In addition, beach patrols were kept on high alert as Fran generated large waves on the Florida beaches. Georgia The first hurricane watches and warnings for Georgia were first imposed on September 4 as Hurricane Fran became a major hurricane with a watch extending from Florida through Georgia and into South Carolina The watch was upgraded to a warning later that day as Fran moved closer to the coast. While areas south of Brunswick, Georgia were only issued a tropical storm warning, areas north of the city were declared under a hurricane warning until September 5, when it was downgraded into a tropical storm warning. All watches and warnings on the Georgia coast were discontinued by the end of September 6. On September 4, while much of Georgia was under a hurricane watch, multiple emergency operation centers were activated. When the watch was upgraded, the state declared a mandatory evacuation for Chatham County while Liberty County issued a voluntary evacuation order for its residents. The state's electric membership corporations began cooperating with other utility companies in preparation for the storm. Impact Throughout the eastern United States, Fran produced strong winds and heavy rainfall, leading to widespread flash flooding and wind damage. The most severe damage took place in North Carolina where 14 people died, one of which was from a heart attack, and the storm left over $2.4\u00a0billion in losses. Throughout other states, 13 other people lost their lives and an additional $800\u00a0million in damage was caused. Overall, Hurricane Fran was directly responsible for 22 fatalities and indirectly for five others as well as $5\u00a0billion in damage. At the time, Fran was one of the ten costliest hurricanes to strike the United States; however, several other storms have since surpassed it. Florida and South Carolina Prior to moving over the Carolinas , large swells produced by Hurricane Fran impacted the Florida coastline. Along the beaches of Palm Beach County , five people aboard an 18\u00a0ft (5.5\u00a0m) fishing boat were knocked into the water by the rough seas. However, the Coast Guard rescued all five persons without incident. As Fran made landfall in North Carolina, the outer bands of the storm brought heavy rains and gusty winds to eastern South Carolina. Several areas reported winds in excess of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h), leading to numerous downed trees and power lines. Some cars and homes were damaged after being struck by fallen trees. In Dillon County , winds gusting up to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) caused significant damage to many homes. Debris was left in the wake of Fran across the county than during Hurricane Hugo in 1989 . One person was injured and damage to crops and infrastructure reached $6.5\u00a0million. In Marlboro County , roughly 3,200 people were left without power and two sheriffs were injured after their car struck a fallen tree. The most severe damage in South Carolina took place in Horry County where winds reached 77\u00a0mph (124\u00a0km/h). Numerous trees were felled by the winds, leaving roughly 60,000 residents without power. One person was killed after her car fell down an embankment. Extensive agricultural losses were sustained in the area, estimated at $19.8\u00a0million. Structural damage was less severe, with losses estimated at $1\u00a0million. A second car-related fatality during Fran took place in Williamsburg County . Combined economic losses in Berkeley and Charleston counties reached $20\u00a0million. Throughout South Carolina, Fran was responsible for two fatalities, five injuries and roughly $48.5\u00a0million in damage. North Carolina A home in Kure Beach, North Carolina was destroyed by Fran along the state coastline. Fran caused coastal damage from the South Carolina border to Topsail Island, North Carolina . Its 12-foot storm surge carried away a temporary North Topsail Beach police station and town hall, housed in a double-wide trailer since Hurricane Bertha 's rampage across the same area in July. The Kure Beach Pier was destroyed during the storm as well. Extensive flooding struck the coast around Wrightsville Beach , just up the coast from Cape Fear. In Jacksonville, North Carolina , three schools and several homes were damaged. The storm was most damaging to the barrier islands on the North Carolina coastline. Further inland, the storm caused damage on its way north from Wilmington to Raleigh . Unexpectedly, high wind damage extended along the I-40 corridor up through Raleigh and points north and as far west as Guilford County , damaging historic buildings and trees throughout the Triangle including at North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina Classes were canceled for the day at UNC due to a state of emergency in Chapel Hill, and it was almost a week before the university's water supply was drinkable again. Rain of up to 16 inches (406\u00a0mm) deluged interior North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia , bringing dangerous river flooding to much of the mid-Atlantic. Hurricane Fran's thrashing of North Carolina aggravated the state's problems caused by numerous weather disasters in 1996. At least six people were killed in the Carolinas ; most of them were from automobile accidents and more died as a result of the shock from the damage of the storm. In North Carolina , 1.3\u00a0million people were left without power . In North Topsail Beach and Carteret County , there was over $500\u00a0million (1996\u00a0USD) in damage and 90% of structures were damaged. One male teenager died from drowning caused by flooding of Crabtree Creek at Old Lassiter Mill in Raleigh. Fran also destroyed the basketball gym on the campus of St. Andrews College in Laurinburg, North Carolina as well as 3 piers in Surf City. Rainfall from Hurricane Fran in the United States Total damage in North Carolina amounted to over $2.4\u00a0billion. This was the second hurricane to make landfall on North Carolina that year. The first was Hurricane Bertha, which hit the state a few weeks prior. Virginia In Virginia, tropical storm-force winds lashed Chesapeake Bay and increased water levels in the Potomac River around the nation's capital, where it backed up into Georgetown and Old Town Alexandria, Virginia . There was severe damage to power lines that left 415,000 people without electricity, making it the largest storm related power outage in history until Hurricane Isabel in 2003. Along the Rappahannock River , a storm surge of 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) damaged or sank several small boats and damaged wharfs and bulkheads. This was the highest tide in the state since Hurricane Hazel of 1954. Rain up to 16\u00a0in (410\u00a0mm) fell in the western part of Virginia , making Fran the fourth wettest known tropical cyclone to impact Virginia and causing major flash flooding. The floods shut down many of the primary and secondary roads and closed Shenandoah National Park . Fran destroyed about 300 homes, mostly from flooding, and 100 people had to be rescued. Page County , downslope of the 16\" of rainfall from Big Meadows , was the hardest hit locality in the state of Virginia with regards to damage. Three days after the storm had passed, \"hundreds\" of people were still stranded. Some 78 homes were destroyed and 417 were damaged, however there were no deaths. At one point on Friday every town in the county was isolated due to high water. Floodwaters caused by Hurricane Fran overtop the Main Street Bridge in Luray, Virginia on September 6, 1996. In the county seat of Luray , the Hawksbill Creek cut the town in half for much of the day, and the strong current forced a house off its foundation and placed in the endzone of Luray High School 's football field. Water from the Hawksbill reached 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) from the top of the field goal upright\u2014 16\u00a0ft (4.9\u00a0m) of water covered the ground. Bulldog field was flooded for over a week after the storm, until finally the standing water was pumped across U.S. Route 340 back into the Hawksbill Creek. Also in downtown Luray, the large flood-driven waves of the creek demolished three buildings, including the Adelphia Cable building. The creek, typically less than a foot deep, overtook the downtown Main Street Bridge, which rises some 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) above the creek bed. The Shenandoah River crested some 20\u00a0ft (6.1\u00a0m) above flood stage. The South Fork of the Shenandoah River recorded its highest crests ever, 26.95\u00a0ft (8.21\u00a0m) in Luray and 37\u00a0ft (11\u00a0m) in Front Royal, Virginia , which was 22\u00a0ft (6.7\u00a0m) above the 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) flood stage. In Rockingham County, Virginia , over 10,000 people were evacuated from their homes, however most were allowed to return to their homes after the water subsided. West Virginia Up to 7\u00a0inches (178\u00a0mm) of rain fell, causing widespread flash flooding. Pendleton and Hardy County were the hardest hit as the floods swept away several bridges, damaged several water plants and caused a reported gas leak. Maryland Western Maryland was hard hit by Fran, mostly from flash flooding. About 650 homes were damaged and there was $100\u00a0million (1996\u00a0USD) in damage. This was the worst flooding event to hit Maryland since Hurricane Hazel and the January flood of 1996. District of Columbia In the District of Columbia , Fran produced gusty winds and moderate rainfall. Gusts in the area were recorded in excess of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) and rainfall peaked near 3.5\u00a0in (89\u00a0mm). Minor flash flooding was reported on many streets, hampering travel and leaving several roads were closed. These winds downed several trees in saturated soil. A strong southerly wind and high tide led to a 5.1\u00a0ft (1.6\u00a0m) storm surge in Washington Harbor. In addition to the storm surge, a river flood rivaling that of the January 1996 flood took place in the metropolitan area. Throughout Washington, D.C., Fran left roughly $20\u00a0million in damage. Pennsylvania About 15 Western Pennsylvania counties were impacted by flash flooding as rainfall up to 7\u00a0inches (178\u00a0mm) caused the Juniata River to overrun its banks. Ohio, Michigan, New England, and Canada The remnants of Fran brought moderate to heavy rainfall to parts of eastern Ohio, especially along the coast of Lake Erie , as the storm moved through the region. A maximum of 6.47\u00a0in (164\u00a0mm) of rain fell near Elyria in relation to Fran. Sustained winds in the state were recorded around 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h) and gusts reached 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). These winds downed numerous trees and power lines, some of which fell on cars and homes. Agricultural land and the region sustained significant damage. In Cleveland , the city zoo sustained some flood damage and the monkey island was completely inundated. In Cuyahoga County at least 90 homes reported basement flooding. Widespread street and basement flooding took place across Lorain County , with some areas reporting standing water several days after Fran's passage. Throughout Ohio, the remnants of Fran left roughly $40\u00a0million in damage and no loss of life. Continuing northward, Fran moved into southern Canada on September\u00a07; however, the outer bands of the storm brought some rainfall to extreme eastern Michigan. In Port Huron , a state maximum amount of 4.07\u00a0in (103\u00a0mm) of rain fell during the storm's passage. No known flooding or damage took place throughout the state. Turning northeast and becoming extratropical, Fran brought scattered rainfall to parts of New England. A small area around Boston, Massachusetts received the heaviest rain in the region, peaking at 5.53\u00a0in (140\u00a0mm) in East Wareham . Isolated areas of 1 to 2\u00a0in (25 to 51\u00a0mm) of rain fell across portions of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine before Fran dissipated over eastern Canada on September\u00a08. In nearby southern Canada, the remnants of Fran had little impact in Ontario , other than causing rain delays in a minor t-ball tournament, producing light to moderate rainfall between 1.8 and 2.6\u00a0in (45 and 65\u00a0mm). Aftermath A sign put up by a resident of North Carolina, Topsail Island following the severe damage from Fran The Cape Fear River watershed was devastated by Fran. Severe water quality problems persisted for weeks. The Northeast Cape Fear river suffered a massive fish kill. Sewage treatment plant failures led to millions of gallons of raw and partially treated human sewage to flow into area rivers. Dissolved oxygen content fell to nearly zero across the Cape Fear and Northeast Cape Fear Rivers for over three weeks, which led to hypoxia in the Cape Fear estuary for several weeks. Ammonium and phosphorus levels increased, with concentrations of phosphorus reaching a 27-year high. Retirement See also: List of retired Atlantic hurricane names Because of the damage caused by the hurricane, the name Fran was retired in the spring of 1997 by the World Meteorological Organization , and will never again be used for another North Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with Fay for the 2002 season .

In his style of practice, derived from the so-called New Burmese Method of U N\u0101rada , the meditator lives according to Buddhist morality as a prerequisite for meditation practice. Meditation itself entails the practice of \"bare insight,\" using satipa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na , the four foundations of mindfulness, to anchor the attention on the sensations of the rising and falling of the abdomen during breathing, observing carefully any other sensations or thoughts. This is coupled to reflection on the Buddhist teachings on causality , thereby gaining insight into anicca , dukkha , and anatt\u0101 and attaining stream entry . Mah\u0101s\u012b Say\u0101daw was a questioner and final editor at the Sixth Buddhist Council on May 17, 1954. Biography Mah\u0101si Say\u0101daw was born in 1904 in Seikkhun village in Upper Burma . He became a novice at age twelve, and was ordained at the age of twenty with the name Sobhana. Over the course of decades of study, he passed the rigorous series of government examinations in the Therav\u0101da Buddhist texts, gaining the newly introduced Dhamm\u0101cariya ( dhamma teacher) degree in 1941. In 1931, U Sobhana took leave from teaching scriptural studies in Moulmein , South Burma, and went to nearby Thaton to practice intensive Vipassana meditation under Mingun Jetawun Say\u0101daw (also rendered Mingun Jetavana Say\u0101daw), also known as U N\u0101rada . This teacher had practiced in the remote Sagaing Hills of Upper Burma, under the guidance of Aletawya Say\u0101daw, a student of the forest meditation master Thelon Say\u0101daw. U Sobh\u0101na first taught Vipassana meditation in his home village in 1938, at a monastery named for its massive drum 'Mah\u0101si'. He became known in the region as Mah\u0101si Say\u0101daw. In 1947, the Prime Minister of Burma, U Nu , invited Mah\u0101si Say\u0101daw to be resident teacher at a newly established meditation center in Yangon, which came to be called the Mah\u0101si S\u0101sana Yeiktha. Mah\u0101si Say\u0101daw was a questioner and final editor at the Sixth Buddhist Council on May 17, 1954. He helped establish meditation centers all over Burma as well as in Sri Lanka , Indonesia , Thailand , and by 1972 the centers under his guidance had trained more than 700,000 meditators. In 1979, he travelled to the West, holding retreats at newly founded centers such as the Insight Meditation Society (IMS) in Barre, Massachusetts , U.S. In addition, meditators came from all over the world to practice at his center in Yangon . When the Mah\u0101si Say\u0101daw died on 14 August 1982 following a massive stroke, thousands of devotees braved the torrential monsoon rains to pay their last respects. Practice Mah\u0101si's method is based on the Satipa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na Sutta , which describes how one focuses attention on the breath, noticing how one breathes in and out. Practice begins with the preparatory stage, the practice of s\u012bla , morality, giving up worldly thoughts and desires. The practitioner then engages in satipatthana by mindfulness of breathing. One pays attention to any arising mental or physical phenomenon, engaging in vitakka , noting or naming physical and mental phenomena (\"breathing, breathing\"), without engaging the phenomenon with further conceptual thinking. By noticing the arising of physical and mental phenomena, the meditator becomes aware how sense impressions arise from the contact between the senses and physical and mental phenomena, as described in the five skandhas and pa\u1e6diccasamupp\u0101da . This noticing is accompanied by reflections on causation and other Buddhist teachings, leading to insight into anicca , dukkha , and anatt\u0101 . When the three characteristics have been comprehended, reflection subdues, and the process of noticing accelerates, noting phenomena in general, without necessarily naming them.

{"id": "doc_random_114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaga_Zombie_(film_series)", "text": "Plaga Zombie is an Argentine comedy horror film series created by Pablo Par\u00e9s , Berta Mu\u00f1iz , and Hern\u00e1n S\u00e1ez. The films follow three misfit heroes who uncover an alien-government conspiracy after a zombie outbreak occurs in their hometown. Plaga Zombie was the first-ever zombie horror film released in Argentina and is the only zombie horror trilogy to be produced in Latin America . Plaga Zombie received mainstream coverage from Fangoria and was picked up by its horror label, Fangoria Films International , helping the series to attain a worldwide cult following. The latest installment of the series, Plaga Zombie: American Invasion , began production in the summer of 2013. History The original Plaga Zombie film was conceived by Pablo Par\u00e9s and Hern\u00e1n S\u00e1ez. Using a family video camera, the two began making home movies with a group of childhood friends in high school. Several people became key personal for FARSA Productions, most notably, Berta Mu\u00f1iz , Paulo Soria and Walter Corn\u00e1s. At age 17, Par\u00e9s and S\u00e1ez decided to start their first major film project, a horror comedy about a zombie outbreak which occurs in their hometown, which they both directed, wrote, and starred in with Mu\u00f1iz. Produced on a very low budget, reportedly for only a few hundred dollars, and no formal film training, Plaga Zombie was very popular with audiences in Argentina and eventually gained an international following. The filmmakers used common household items such as cake mix and food coloring for the zombie make up in Plaga Zombie . In the sequel, they also used toilet paper , unflavored gelatin (with water to make a paste ), and latex . Although the filmmakers immediately began working on the sequel, Plaga Zombie: Zona Mutante took over four years to complete. The film had over twice the budget as the first Plaga Zombie, estimated at $3,000, significantly improving production value. The filmmakers, however, claimed that the film \" took its toll on everyone \" and at one point production was halted to film Never Go to Those Kind of Parties (2000). There was difficulty in finding extras for the film and were confronted by angry residents and policemen during shooting. A local television station aired a special broadcast asking for people to play zombies which included giving out the director's home phone number. Several friendly police officers also visited the set to ask for cameos in the film. Post-production was also a painstaking process with literally years worth of footage to fit into a 100 min. film. Par\u00e9s and S\u00e1ez did not finish editing their film until 40 minutes before its theatrical premiere requiring it to be played back on a laptop. The third and final chapter of the series, Plaga Zombie: Zona Mutante \u2013 Revoluci\u00f3n T\u00f3xica , was released in 2012. Unlike the first two films which used traditional special effects, the filmmakers employed computer-generated imagery for the first time. Franca Gallo and Rodrigo Guerechit of Rabbid EFX, who had previously worked on their 2011 horror short Daemonium , were brought in as the main special effects artists. In addition to certain action sequences, the length of time between films meant that the stars were significantly older compared to the 1997 film. Each entry in the series covered 24 hours of the 3-day alien invasion and so it was necessary to maintain the illusion that the three had not aged. They did try to keep the film faithful to the visual style of the previous entries. The Plaga Zombie trilogy was eventually released on FARSA Productions official YouTube channel with the first in November 2010, the second in September 2011, and the third in March 2012; Plaga Zombie: Zona Mutante has received over 2 million views on the website (as of September 2013). Future In the spring of 2013, it was announced that a new Plaga Zombie film would be produced in the United States by Sai-Con Productions. An independent film studio based in New Bedford, Massachusetts , the company is best known for its award-winning 2007 horror film The Terror Factor . Writer-director Garry Mederios discovered the Plaga Zombie series after watching the Fangoria Film DVD. Mederios enjoyed the series so much that he contacted the filmmakers via e-mail and became friends. He jokingly suggested making an American-based Plaga Zombie film during one of their exchanges but FARSA Productions was very receptive to the idea and plans were eventually made to produce a feature-length film. Set in the same universe as the original trilogy, Plaga Zombie: American Invasion is to feature three new characters who emerge during a zombie outbreak in New Bedford, Massachusetts. It was confirmed by both cast member Walter Rivero and director Garry Mederios that Pablo Par\u00e9s, Berta Mu\u00f1iz, and Hern\u00e1n S\u00e1ez will be making cameo appearances . A relative of Argentine-born actor Ben Tolosa, one of the three U.S. co-stars, is a close family friend of the FARSA filmmakers though Tolosa himself was unaware of this connection when he first auditioned for the role. Rivero, who had a minor part in Plaga Zombie: Zona Mutante , will have a supporting role (albeit as another character) in the film. The film will be using a combination of digital and special effects similar to Plaga Zombie: Zona Mutante \u2013 Revoluci\u00f3n T\u00f3xica . A FARSA Productions special effects artist will be designing prosthetics and props for one of the lead cast members. Principal filming is to take place in downtown New Bedford and should be completed by the following spring. The first day of shooting began on September 29, 2013, on West Island Beach in Fairhaven, Massachusetts . Another film shoot at Sinners & Saints, a tattoo parlor in East Wareham , was covered by the Wareham Weekly. Plaga Zombie: American Invasion was partially funded by a crowdsourcing campaign on Indiegogo as well as a number of promotional events held in Southern New England . The producers introduced unique fundraising ideas based on the level of donations, ranging from $10 to $100, which includes an appearance in the film, access to exclusive events, and various merchandise; a donation of $1,000 earns a producer credit and business shown in the film while $2,500 allows the donor to choose one of two possible endings for the film. The production was selected by NewEnglandFilm.com for its New England\u2013based feature film project of the month in October 2013. One of Sai-Con's upcoming promotional events will be at the 2013 Monster Dash, a 5k race and zombie walk , in Worcester, Massachusetts and Providence, Rhode Island on October 26\u201327, 2013. The winner of the 2013 Monster Dash will receive a minor role in the film. Films Plaga Zombie (1997) Main article: Plaga Zombie Plaga Zombie follows Bill Johnson (Pablo Par\u00e9s), John West (Berta Mu\u00f1iz), and Max Giggs (Hern\u00e1n S\u00e1ez), who find themselves in the midst of a zombie outbreak in their hometown. The cause of the outbreak is an alien-engineered virus, introduced into the local population, meant to exterminate the human race. When a horde of zombies break into Bill's house, the three young men are forced to hide in an upstairs bedroom and must devise a way to kill the zombie invaders to survive. Plaga Zombie: Zona Mutante (2001) Main article: Plaga Zombie: Zona Mutante Set hours after the first film, Plaga Zombie: Zona Mutante reveals that an Argentine government agency is working with the aliens in exchange for protection from the virus. Bill Johnson, John West, and Max Giggs are among the remaining survivors from the outbreak being held in custody. Rather than executing them, as demanded by Agent James Dana (Esteban Podetti), the agency chief (Alejandro Nagy) orders that the three be released back into the zombie-infested town. Once back inside, the trio find the alien virus has transformed their entire hometown. They briefly find refuge in John West's house but are separated when Bill is carried off during a zombie attack. John and Max attempt to find their way out of the town and get help but upon reaching the city limits find a deep ravine blocking escape. Meanwhile, Bill manages to elude his zombie captors and encounters an injured agent (Andres Perrone) hiding in the sewers. The agent explains he was abandoned by his team after being bitten by a zombie but still has a floppy disk which shows the town's one remaining escape route. Bill later gains possession of the disk, and once rejoining his friends, is able to access a working computer only to discover that it will take 12 hours to decode the disk. As they await the countdown, Bill, John, and Max must not only avoid the town's zombies but also a government death squad headed by Agent Dana. Plaga Zombie: Zona Mutante \u2013 Revoluci\u00f3n T\u00f3xica (2012) It has been three days since the zombie outbreak. Bill Johnson, John West, and Max Giggs are being chased by a UFO which locks on to a zombie being carried by John. The luchadore holds on to the zombie, egged on by Giggs, but is unable to win against the ship's tractor beam which radically transforms John in the process. It is during this encounter that Bill and Giggs discover a disturbing secret regarding the zombies. Tired of running, the three heroes decide to take the fight to the aliens. Giggs develops a plan in which the three will capture an infected human, feed it large amounts of gunpowder, and lure the aliens into taking it aboard their spacecraft. Once aboard, the \" trojan zombie \" would explode and destroy the alien mothership. Shortly after splitting up, however, they lose contact with each other and become sidetracked. John discovers he has lost his strength after being humiliated by a gang of zombies and becomes plagued with fear and self-doubt. After witnessing a government helicopter crash, Bill pursues renegade agent Jack Taylor (Walter Corn\u00e1s) who has a device able to detect the alien mothership. Giggs manages to capture a zombie, which he names \"Junior\" (Paulo Soria), but soon develops a parental affection for it and begins to have second thoughts about going through with the plan. Can the three stop the aliens before they move on to the next phase of their invasion? Plaga Zombie: American Invasion (2021) The story takes place 20 years after the events of the original trilogy. The aliens reappear in New England where they introduce a new virus in New Bedford, Massachusetts to create another zombie outbreak. In order to stop the virus from spreading to the rest of the country, the U.S. government decides to \"detach the city at its faultline\", separating it from the continental United States, and setting New Bedford adrift into the Atlantic Ocean. four new heroes\u2014Nash Walker (Corey Spencer), Sam Samson (Matthew Hill), and Manny Distefano (Ben Tolosa) and a mercenary for hire Kobra Guevara (Walter Rivero)\u2014emerge during the initial hours of the outbreak. Like their Argentine counterparts, they too must battle a city overrun by zombies to defeat the alien invasion in addition to stopping the \" floating city \" before it collides with the Azores Islands . Cast and characters Crew and other Reception Plaga Zombie, a landmark film in the Argentine independent film industry, as well as amateur filmmaking, was the first feature film about zombies made in Argentina. While made with a very low budget and limited resources, the film became a shining example as both a cult and fantasy film generating a horror film movement in the country that has continued to grow into the 21st century. The film has maintained its cult status, especially among fans of gore. UNC-Chapel Hill film scholar Jonathan Risner considers Plaga Zombie to mark the beginning of modern Argentine horror cinema . The success of the series inspired similar horror films in South America such as Uruguay's Achuras (2003), Chile's Solos (2008), and Brazil's Mangue negro (2008). Argentine director Germ\u00e1n Magari\u00f1os , who played a zombie in the original film, went on to the country's second zombie horror Zombie Apocalypse Now: A Zombie Hunter (2008). It was at the Mar del Plata Film Festival where Par\u00e9s met Filipe Melo , creator of the first-ever Portuguese horror short I'll See You In My Dreams . After meeting the Plaga Zombie crew, Melo invited Par\u00e9s to his home in Mouraz, Portugal to collaborate on a film script . The two wrote a first draft of what would become The Adventures of Dog Mendon\u00e7a & Pizzaboy in 15 days. The second film in the trilogy, Plaga Zombie: Zona Mutante, was released in 2001 and subsequently screened in film festivals around the world. On November 4, 2002, it was one of eleven films selected for the \"Perversa America Latina\" portion of the 13th annual San Sebastian Horror and Fantasy Film Festival and one of two, along with Armando B\u00f3 's 1968 film Carne, to represent Argentina at the festival. The film made its debut in the United Kingdom on April 26, 2003, for the 10th anniversary of the \" Dead by Dawn \" horror film festival at the Edinburgh Filmhouse . As one of the festival's midnight movies , Simon Wilkinson of Kinoeye.org observed that \"the film succeeded in grabbing the audience's attention\u2014at one point even resorting to an irresistibly catchy, impromptu musical number placed amidst the relentless action.\" The Plaga Zombie series was profiled by Fangoria during this period resulting in considerable exposure for the filmmakers. Fangoria film producer Steven Mackler described watching Plaga Zombie for the first time: When I screened Plaga Zombie in my office, the howls of laughter from both my daughter and me echoed throughout the building. The film is off-the-wall and totally crazy. Plaga Zombie is not your garden-variety zombie film. It's as if Monty Python made a horror/splatter flick. The horror magazine eventually bought the film rights to Plaga Zombie: Zona Mutante which was released worldwide by its film label Fangoria Films International . On September 12, 2005, making its U.S. East Coast premiere, it was screened at the East Village 's Two Boots Pioneer Theater as the feature attraction for Fangoria's monthly \"Monster Mondays\" film series. Walter Rivero, a cast member of the film, claimed the young filmmakers never received payment for the film rights and led to a falling out between Fangoria and FARSA Productions. The third film in the trilogy, Plaga Zombie: Revoluci\u00f3n T\u00f3xica, premiered at the Buenos Aires Rojo Sangre on October 30, 2011. Revoluci\u00f3n T\u00f3xica received the Audience Award for Best Feature Film and Hern\u00e1n S\u00e1ez won for Best Actor. The Plaga Zombie series was given special recognition by the Jury for \"creative efforts over time to build a trilogy\". It was also screened at the Mar del Plata Film Festival in Mar del Plata, Argentina and the Montevideo Comics fan convention in Montevideo, Uruguay . Plaga Zombie: Revoluci\u00f3n T\u00f3xica was released in theatres in March 2012. It opened in Buenos Aires on March 12, 2012, and then throughout Argentina at the end of the month. The film was simultaneously broadcast online with its theatrical debut. On April 12, 2013, the film was screened to a sold-out crowd at the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema . Reviews for all three films have been generally positive and praised for its over-the-top action scenes and gore effects. Its humorous \" slapstick \" approach to the genre earned comparisons to similar horror-comedies such as Peter Jackson 's Bad Taste and Dead Alive or Sam Raimi 's Evil Dead II . The filmmakers themselves are admitted fans of these films but claim never to have seen George A. Romero 's Night of the Living Dead series . Peter Dendle , a Penn State Mont Alto film scholar, has said that the films are more akin to Japanese-style horror with \"the deliberate piling up of non-sequiters and flaunting of narrative expectations\".

Chief Coastguards are responsible for the policy, planning and execution of a Coastguard Service. In some countries this means that the Chief Coastguard is de facto Chief Executive officer of the Coastguard Service, although more commonly the Chief Coastguard reports to a government minister or executive agency, board or committee. HM Chief Coastguard (United Kingdom) Rank insignia of the United Kingdom's Chief Coastguard. Function In the United Kingdom, the head of the operational Coastguard service bears the title \"His Majesty's Chief Coastguard\", usually shortened to simply \"Chief Coastguard\". When in uniform he or she wears rank markings similar to those of a Rear Admiral in the Royal Navy . The Chief Coastguard is the most senior member of the Coastguard service; he or she reports to the Chief Executive of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (who is a civil servant , and not an operational coastguard), who in turn reports direct to the United Kingdom Government through the Secretary of State for Transport . According to the official website of the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency , the functions of the Chief Coastguard are to co-ordinate five main tasks: to initiate and co-ordinate civil maritime search and rescue within the UK Search and Rescue Region to initiate and co-ordinate counter-pollution measures to minimise the impact of pollution on the sea and shoreline to ensure the public interest is fully taken into account when an accident to a ship might require salvage or other emergency action to maintain contingency plans for dealing with major maritime incidents within UK waters to develop and promote a sea safety and SAR Prevention strategy Recent office holders John Astbury became Chief Coastguard in 1996 and combined this post with that of Director of Operations for the newly formed MCA in 1998. He retained this post until he became Chief Executive of the MCA in 2007: he was appointed a CBE in 2005. He was succeeded by Peter Dymond in 2007. Peter Dymond retired from the office of Chief Coastguard in 2009, and was appointed OBE for his meritorious service. He was replaced by Chief Coastguard Rod Johnson, who served until 2013. Pending the appointment of a new Chief Coastguard, Mr Dymond returned to the role as Acting Chief Coastguard until he retired in and was succeeded by Richard Martin, OBE, JP. Chief Coastguard's Commendation (award) Members of HM Coastguard are entitled to receive long service awards after stated periods of continuous service, but the Chief Coastguard is empowered to award the additional \"Chief Coastguard's Commendation\" as an award for bravery, or for exceptionally meritorious service.

{"id": "doc_random_118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Parmelee", "text": "Christopher Matthew Parmelee (born February 24, 1988) is an American former professional baseball right fielder and first baseman . He stands 6\u00a0feet 1\u00a0inch (1.85\u00a0m) and weighs 210 pounds (95\u00a0kg), and bats and throws left handed. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins , Baltimore Orioles and New York Yankees . Minor league career The Twins selected Parmelee with their first round (20th overall) pick in the 2006 Major League Baseball draft after he hit .407 with 11 home runs and 26 runs batted in (RBIs) as a senior at Chino Hills High School in Chino Hills, California . As soon as the Twins signed Parmelee, he instantly became one of the organizations top power hitting prospects , and was projected to be a potential impact player in the middle of their lineup within the next few years. Parmelee began his professional career with the Twins' rookie league affiliate, the Gulf Coast Twins . After batting .279 with eight home runs in 45 games, he earned a promotion to the single-A Beloit Snappers . He returned to Beloit for the 2007 season, where he hit .239 with a team-leading 15 home runs in 128 games. He returned to Beloit again in 2008 due to a glut of outfielders in the Twins farm system. Although he missed a good part of the season due to a broken wrist and had the same .239 batting average, he nearly equaled his output from 2007, hitting 14 home runs in just 69 games while increasing his on-base percentage from .313 to .385 and his slugging percentage from .414 to .496. Parmelee began the 2009 season assigned to the Twins' advanced-A affiliate, the Fort Myers Miracle , with whom he batted .244 with five home runs and 28 RBIs in the first half of the season. He joined teammates Carlos Guti\u00e9rrez , Chris Cates , and Ben Revere as All-stars for the Florida State League 's Southern division, and won the home run derby held before the game. Parmelee started the 2010 season with Fort Myers, but was quickly promoted to the double-A New Britain Rock Cats . In his first season at that level, he batted .275 in 111 games, but his power numbers dipped, as he hit just six home runs. This led to Parmelee returning to New Britain for the 2011 season, where he improved his numbers to a .287 batting average with 13 homers in 142 games. Major league career Minnesota Twins 2011 After clubbing 74 home runs and driving in 370 runs over six years in the minor leagues, Parmelee received his first call to the majors in September 2011. He, Joe Benson and Liam Hendriks all started for the Twins in their big league debuts on September 6. He hit a single in his first major league at bat to lead off the second, but was stranded at third as the Twins were shut out by Chicago White Sox pitcher Jake Peavy . The following day, he collected his first two major league RBIs with a double to center off John Danks in the Twins' 5-4 victory over the White Sox. On September 17 against the Cleveland Indians , Parmelee went 3-for-3 and hit his first major league home run in the eighth inning off Josh Judy . He finished the year with a .355 average, four home runs and 14 RBI in 21 games. 2012 Parmelee with the Twins in 2013 With the Twins' regular first baseman, Justin Morneau , starting the season as the designated hitter , Parmelee opened the 2012 season with the Twins as their starting first baseman despite not yet having played at triple-A . Morneau was placed on the disabled list in April, but Parmelee struggled as well, batting just .179 and without a home run through mid-May and was optioned to the triple-A Rochester Red Wings on May 16 when Morneau was activated. Parmelee hit well in his first taste of the highest level of the minor leagues, batting .375 with four homers, and was brought back to the major leagues on June 7. He was returned to the minors on July 5, promoted briefly again while Morneau was on paternity leave in late July, then finally called up for good on August 29. Overall, he had hit .338 at Rochester with 17 home runs in just 64 games, good enough to lead the team. In his major league time, he finished with a .229 average, five home runs and 20 RBI in 64 games. 2013 With Morneau recovered, the Twins made Parmelee their starting right fielder on Opening Day of the 2013 season. In early May, Parmelee started sharing right field duties with Oswaldo Arcia . Ryan Doumit also got time in right field. Parmelee also got starts at first base filling in for Justin Morneau . At the All-Star break, Parmelee was optioned to Rochester. At the time, Parmelee was hitting .223 with 8 HR and 20 RBI. Playing first base and right field for Rochester, in 45 games, he hit .231 with 3 HR and 22 RBI. On September 9, Parmelee was recalled by the Twins after Rochester's season was over. Parmelee split first base duties with Chris Colabello to finish the season. In 101 games with Minnesota in 2013, Parmelee hit .228 with 8 HR and 24 RBI. 2014 Parmelee was outrighted off the Twins roster on March 27, 2014. He was re-added to the roster on May 9.

{"id": "doc_random_120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NZR_KB_class", "text": "The NZR K B class of 1939 was a class of six mixed traffic steam locomotives built for New Zealand Railways Department (NZR), that operated on New Zealand 's railway network . After the success of the K class , the K B class were built to meet the increasing traffic demands on the Midland Line in the South Island . The locomotives had a wheel arrangement of 4-8-4 and first appeared with distinctive streamlining, mainly to hide their ACFI feedwater systems. History Following the success of the K class in the North Island , there was a need for similar locomotives to operate the Midland Line , primarily between Springfield and Arthur's Pass . These new locomotives incorporated a number of improvements upon the K class, including a re-designed plate frame to eliminate cracking issues the K class experienced; roller bearings on all wheels; hydrostatic lubrication throughout; and the inclusion of the ACFI feed-water system that had been pioneered on K 919. The ACFI equipment's aesthetic appearance had been criticised, hence the K B and contemporary K A classes were both fitted with shrouding to obscure it. The K B class were technically very similar to the K A class, but were distinguished by the inclusion of a booster engine on the rear axle of the trailing bogie and Nicholson thermic syphons in the firebox . The use of the booster, first proposed for the K class in 1932, was mainly due to steeper gradients and heavy freight trains on the Midland Line, especially Cass bank. Additional piping and sanding equipment for the booster gave the K B a slightly different appearance to the K A . The booster was intended solely for use at low speed, and some class members ultimately had the booster removed due to problems such as jamming in gear, reducing the locomotive's top speed. Construction of the locomotives commenced in 1939. Construction and assembly took place at NZR's Hillside Workshops . The first of the six-member class was produced before the first of the K A class under construction at Hutt Workshops , in June 1939. All of the class were in service by 1940. In service As intended, the K B class were based solely in the South Island and performed most of their work hauling freight trains on the Midland Line . During the Second World War , they were also used on the Main South Line . While the aesthetic shrouding cleaned up the appearance of the locomotives, it was open at the top and gathered soot and dust which affected the working environment in the cab. After the war, the aesthetic shrouding was removed from the locomotives and the ACFI feed-water system was replaced with exhaust steam injector . Although the K and K A classes were converted to burn oil at the same time, the K B class remained as coal burners due to the availability of high grade West Coast coal. Withdrawal and disposal From the mid-1950s, dieselisation impacted the use of the K B class. With the introduction of diesel railcars in the 1950s, the class stopped hauling passenger trains. This became especially pronounced in the 1960s, and the introduction of the DJ class in 1968 brought about their ultimate demise. As they were displaced from duties in the late 1960s, some members were used on the Main South Line, including hauling the South Island Limited . The first withdrawals were K B 's 966 and 969 in October 1967; both were cut up for scrap. K B 969 was withdrawn after hauling the only ever double-headed K B train, having suffered a cracked motion bracket. Before it was sent to the breakers' yard, it was inscribed with a message reading \"Good-bye, Kb969, and you'll come back as roofing iron \" . K B 967 was withdrawn from service in October 1968. This left only three K B 's in service (965, 968 and 970), and of those, only Kb's 968 and 970 were still used regularly while Kb965 was kept as a standby spare locomotive from July 1968 onwards; with the remaining two being withdrawn from service in March 1969. Kb970 was scrapped in late March 1968, while Kb968 made its last long journey on 22 June 1969, hauling a railway enthusiast's excursion from Christchurch to Arthur's Pass and return, and Kb965 was scrapped in late September 1969. Preservation NZR donated members of the K and K A classes for preservation, but due to the considerable technical similarities, it chose not to donate a K B . Instead, enthusiasts purchased one at the scrap market rate of NZ$ 1500 (equal to $22,200 in December 2008 dollars). K B 968 was supposed to be cut up the week following its last excursion, but a collection on the return journey was sufficient to temporarily save the locomotive. Retired school teacher Cyril Evans raised the rest of the $1,500 by showing railway films to Christchurch school children and collecting their donations. The locomotive was then vested into the Ferrymead Heritage Trust on behalf of the children of Canterbury and was displayed for a number of decades at the Ferrymead Railway . It was currently under restoration to mainline operating condition at Mainline Steam 's Wellington depot.

{"id": "doc_random_121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sylvers", "text": "The Sylvers were an American R&B family vocal group from Watts , a neighborhood in Los Angeles . They recorded the singles \"Fool's Paradise\", \" Boogie Fever \", and \" Hot Line \" during the 1970s. Prior to becoming the Sylvers, the four eldest members (Olympia, Leon, Charmaine, and James) recorded as the Little Angels, appearing on shows including You Bet Your Life and Make Room for Daddy . They opened for acts like Johnny Mathis and Ray Charles . During that time, they released two singles: \"Santa Claus Parade\" b/w \"I'll Be a Little Angel\" on Warwick Records and \"Says You\" b/w \"Olympia\" on Capitol Records . Background Members The Sylvers family consisted of ten siblings, nine of whom performed in the band at different times: Olympia Ann \"Olan\" Sylvers (born October 13, 1951) \u2014 vocals Leon Frank Sylvers III (born March 7, 1953) \u2014 bass, vocals Charmaine Elaine Sylvers (born March 9, 1954) \u2014 vocals James Jonathan Sylvers (born June 8, 1955) \u2014 keyboards, vocals Edmund Theodore Sylvers (January 25, 1957 \u2014 March 11, 2004) \u2014 vocals, percussion Joseph Richard \"Ricky\" Sylvers (born October 13, 1958) guitar, vocals Angelia Marie \"Angie\" Sylvers (born April 11, 1960) \u2014 vocals Patricia Lynn \"Pat\" Sylvers (born March 25, 1961) \u2014 additional keyboards, vocals Foster Emerson Sylvers (born February 25, 1962) \u2014 additional bass, vocals Christopher Joseph Sylvers (1966\u20131985), the youngest of the Sylvers siblings, never performed with the group. Career Shirley Mae Wyble and Leon Frank \"Sonny\" Sylvers married after meeting at Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans . They had ten children. They taught their children to play music, sing and dance. Olympia \"Olan\", Leon, and Charmaine performed as the Little Angels, choosing mainly Caribbean Calypso \u2013styled soul music. The Sylvers appeared in several variety shows, charity shows, community events, and other public venues. One of the earliest events promoting the group was when the whole family appeared on the quiz game show \" You Bet Your Life \" with Groucho Marx . Soon after, Jonathan \"James\" joined the group, and the four of them continued to perform, gaining slight success. Appearing in several television shows, and media appearances. In the mid-1960s, they released recordings on Capitol Records . In the late 1960s, they added Edmund and Joseph Richard \"Ricky\" to the group. After signing a recording contract with MGM, the sextet changed their name from the Little Angels to the Sylvers and released three albums on the MGM/Pride label, titled simply The Sylvers , The Sylvers 2 , and The Sylvers 3 . Released between 1972 and 1974, these LPs offered soulful numbers written by Leon and produced by Jerry Butler (of the Impressions ) and Keg Johnson . Four singles from the self-titled albums entered the Billboard R&B charts . The song \"Fool's Paradise\" reached No. 14 on the R&B charts in the autumn of 1972. The single featured Charmaine, Edmund, and Ricky as lead singers, backed by the harmonies of Olympia, Leon, and James. \"Wish That I Could Talk to You\" was the next single. During early 1973, it became the siblings' first top 10 song. The track features Leon, Edmund, and Ricky on lead. The two-sided hit \"Stay Away From Me\" (No. 33) and \"I'll Never Be Ashamed\", as well as \"Through the Love in My Heart\" (No. 50), followed; and album track \"Cry of a Dreamer\" received significant airplay at R&B radio outlets. In early 1973, Leon wrote an uptempo proto-disco song called \" Misdemeanor \" for the group's second album. However, the lead vocal, sung by Edmund, was later reassigned to younger brother Foster, who was not an official member of the Sylvers at this time. The song also featured younger Sylvers Angie and Pat, received airplay on R&B radio stations, and later became popular in the late 1980s and 1990s when it was sampled by rapper/producer Dr. Dre for a song by the D.O.C. entitled \"It's Funky Enough\". After the success of \"Misdemeanor\", Foster, Angie, and Pat quickly joined their older brothers and sisters to the official Sylvers group, (upping the total members to nine), and signed an exclusive contract with Capitol Records, the same label they recorded for as the Little Angels. The label teamed the family with R&B producer Freddie Perren ( the Jackson 5 ). Perren, with co-writer Keni St. Lewis, produced the two-million seller \" Boogie Fever \" which topped the R&B and Billboard Hot 100 charts, along with the RPM national singles chart. Solo careers As the world's appetite for dance music waned in the early 1980s, so did the Sylvers' popularity. In 1981, five members of the group, now without Edmund, recorded a new album Concept for Solar Records, with Leon producing and playing bass but not performing vocally. The first single from that effort, \"Come Back Lover, Come Back\" (featuring a now grown-up Foster on lead) was a minor hit, reaching No. 63 in Billboard . \"Take It to the Top\" failed to chart, but both singles appear on the Solar Records retrospective box set. In 1984, after a three-year hiatus, the siblings (now six strong, with Charmaine returning) regrouped with new management (Weisner\u2013DeMann) and a new label ( Geffen Records ). The result was an unsuccessful album entitled Bizarre . The disc was not heavily promoted, but spawned two minor hits: \"In One Love and Out the Other\" (No. 42) and \"Falling For Your Love\" (No. 76). The Sylvers' youngest sibling, Christopher, died of hepatitis on June 18, 1985, at age 18. He was never part of the performing family. After the disappointing sales performance of the Geffen LP, the brothers and sisters officially disbanded in 1985. They would continue to do studio work, playing and singing background vocals for artists including Janet Jackson . Edmund recorded a solo album for Arista in 1985, but it was never released in the United States, although a single from the set, \"I Love the Streets\", was released in Japan in 1989. Foster started his own group, Hy-Tech, in 1989, but two CDs went relatively unnoticed, as did a solo MP3 CD in 1998 called \"Foster Vs. Foster\". Lead singer Edmund, who played Marlon Jackson 's voice on the 1971\u20131973 ABC-TV Saturday morning cartoon series The Jackson 5ive , died of lung cancer in Richmond, Virginia, on March 11, 2004, at age 47. In 2007, Pat shared lead on the Larry O. Williams gospel duet, \"Thank You\". In the December 10, 2007 issue of Jet magazine the Sylvers were featured in the \"Where Are They Now?\" segment. In early 2008, a few siblings did an interview with Damien Maurice on his show Just Chillin' with KPOO-FM in San Francisco. Both a Jet article and the radio interview hinted at the possibility of new Sylvers music in the near future. During the summer of 2011, the Sylvers were featured on the TV One hit series, Unsung . Leon, James, Charmaine, Angie and Pat\u2014along with their mother Shirley\u2014appeared on the show to discuss their career successes and aftermath. It was mentioned that both Foster and Ricky had been incarcerated at the time of taping for parole violations. However, after the release of Foster, he and his sisters Angie and Pat made a television appearance on The Cindy Davis Show to discuss the politics of the music industry, and more. Legacy and influence The Sylvers track Only One Can Win appears as a sample in J Dilla \u2019s track Two Can Win on his 2006 album Donuts .

Maria (22 August 1922, in Pampanga, Philippines \u2013 30 December 2006) was a noted Filipino educator and author. He advanced the quality of higher education in the Philippines by improving the accreditation process of educational institutions. He introduced modern practices, changed the auditing method, and incorporated discipline as a part of the culture. Education He was educated at the University of the Philippines (BSE, cum laude ) 1948; Stanford University ( MA ); and Michigan State University ( PhD ) 1962, Sta. Maria joined the University of the Philippines (UP) as instructor right after graduation from college. He was one of the first if not the first Filipino to obtain a doctorate in Communication . UP Baguio He became dean of the UP College of Baguio, where his own \"college education\" began.

SIgMD seems to be a particularly rare antibody deficiency with a reported prevalence between 0.03% (general population) and 0.1% (hospitalized patients). The cause of selective IgM deficiency remains unclear, although various mechanisms have been proposed, such as an increase in regulatory T cell functions, defective T helper cell functions and impaired terminal differentiation of B lymphocytes into IgM-secreting cells among others. In addition it was recently described that hypomorphic mutations in the B-cell receptor (BLNK & BTK) lead to selective IgM deficiency. It is however puzzling that class switching seems to happen normally (serum levels of other antibodies are normal), while dysfunctioning of IgM synthesis is expected to occur together with abnormalities in other immunoglobulins. Notwithstanding a clear pathogenesis and commonly accepted definition, a cutoff for SIgMD could be the lower limit of the serum IgM reference range, such as 43\u00a0mg/dL in adults or even 20\u00a0mg/dL. Signs and symptoms Patients diagnosed with isolated primary immunoglobulin M deficiency frequently exhibit recurrent infections with common microorganisms as well as a higher incidence of autoimmune and allergy disorders. More than 80% of patients with isolated primary immunoglobulin M deficiency have recurrent infections as their presenting symptom. Serious, potentially fatal illnesses could arise from several of these bacterial diseases. Isolated primary immunoglobulin M deficiency can manifest clinically as recurrent otitis media ,\u00a0 bronchiectasis , chronic sinusitis , bronchitis , urinary tract infections ,\u00a0 respiratory infections , \u00a0 cellulitis , meningitis , and sepsis .

Tupelocetus is known from a single fossil specimen, holotype ChM PV6950, which consists of a partial cranium consisting of both P2 teeth (premolars), the right orbital, posterior nasal, and multiple pieces of the ears, including complete petrosal bones and rear processes of the tympanic bones. The holotype was collected in 1999 by Billy Palmer, from whom the singular species of the genus, Tupelocetus palmeri receives its name. The specimen Palmer collected, and later prepared and donated, is now part of the Charleston Museum Vertebrate Paleontology Collection. Tupelocetus differed from other protocetids due to its deep occipital cavity, monocuspid premolars, and large nasal processes. It has been found via tip-dating to be one of the most crownward (or latest surviving) georgiacetine protocetids , along with the genus Aegicetus .

{"id": "doc_random_131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_identity", "text": "Religious identity is a specific type of identity formation . Particularly, it is the sense of group membership to a religion and the importance of this group membership as it pertains to one's self-concept . Religious identity is not necessarily the same as religiousness or religiosity . Although these three terms share a commonality, religiousness and religiosity refer to both the value of religious group membership as well as participation in religious events (e.g. going to church). Religious identity, on the other hand, refers specifically to religious group membership regardless of religious activity or participation. Similar to other forms of identity formation, such as ethnic and cultural identity , the religious context can generally provide a perspective from which to view the world, opportunities to socialize with a spectrum of individuals from different generations, and a set of basic principles to live out. These foundations can come to shape an individual's identity. Despite the implications that religion has on identity development, the identity formation literature has mainly focused on ethnicity and gender and has largely discounted the role of religion. Nevertheless, an increasing number of studies have begun to include religion as a factor of interest. However, many of these studies use religious identity, religiosity, and religiousness interchangeably or solely focus on religious identity and solely religious participation as separate constructs. Of these types of research studies, researchers have examined the various factors that affect the strength of one's religious identity over time. Factors that have been found to affect levels of religious identity include gender, ethnicity, and generational status. 'Identity' is one of the most used terms in the social sciences and has different senses in different research paradigms. In addition to psychological studies, sociologists and anthropologists also apply the term 'religious identity' and examine its related processes in given social contexts. For example, one important study conducted in the United States after the events of September 11, 2001 , explored the meaning-making among American Muslims and how changes in identity ascription (what people think about another group of people) affected how Muslims sought to represent themselves. Other studies have applied concepts appropriated from race and gender identity theory such as disidentification which undermines essentialist accounts of religious identity \u2013 that an individual has a 'fixed' religious identity, independent of pre-existing systems of representation and individuals' positioning within them. Individuals who share the same religious identity are called coreligionists . History During the early 1800s in the field of psychology, research on the topic of religion was considered important and ubiquitous. For example, researchers like G. Stanley Hall and William James conducted studies on such topics as religious conversion . In contrast, the public perspective on religion began to shift two decades later. Instead of religion being seen as an integral part of an individual's life and development and thus a necessary topic to research, scientists and scholars alike viewed religion as a hindrance to the progression of science and as a topic no longer applicable to the current times. Contrary to social scientists' prediction of the general decline of religion over time and increase of secularization leading to a complete abandonment of religious studies , religion did not diminish and was instead acknowledged by researchers as a topic worthwhile to research. Scientists and scholars, like British sociologist John Thompson , realized that despite the neglect of religion in studies, the presence and impact of religion on individuals' lives were undeniable and did not disappear with time. Hence, a body of research on religion began to take root. Particularly, a handful of researchers were interested in examining religious identity during adolescence. Factors that affect religious identity Given that religious traditions can be intricately interlaced with various aspects of culture, the religious identity literature has consistently yielded ethnic, gender, and generational differences. Ethnic differences According to Social Identity Theory , when individuals of ethnic minority backgrounds feel as if their identity is threatened, they may emphasize their other social identities as a means to maintain a positive self-concept. This idea is supported by the various studies that have shown higher levels of religious identity among ethnic minorities, particularly those from Latino and African American backgrounds, compared to European Americans. Gender differences Gender may also impact one's religious identity. Generally, females are more likely than males to attend religious services and express that religion is an important aspect of their lives. Studies have captured this gender difference through observations of females reporting greater religious attitudes. This was also shown in a four-year longitudinal study on religious involvement for adolescents living in rural settings. Females tended to be more involved in church-related activities than males and were more likely to view themselves as religious individuals. Immigrant generational differences There are three categories of generational status: First, Second, and Third. An individual who is considered to be first generation is one who was born outside of the country and immigrated. Second generation refers to an individual who was born in the country but whose parent(s) were foreign-born and immigrated. Lastly, third generation refers to an individual and the individual's parents were born in the country. First and second generation individuals may tend to have particularly higher religious identity levels in comparison to third generation immigrants. In efforts to adjust to the stressful changes associated with the immigration process, finding a community of emotional, social, and financial support, an environment typically provided by a place of worship, may be highly sought after by immigrants. Studies have indeed revealed that adolescents from immigrant families (both first and second generation immigrants) reported higher levels of religious identity compared to adolescents whose parents are not immigrants (third generation). Institutional factors Studies suggest that institutional factors impact on religious identity. For example in a study of Christians, Jews and Muslims in English secondary schools adolescents reported negative representations of their religious traditions in the curriculum and common stereotypes held by their peers. These negative ascriptions were perceived by participants to influence their strategies of representing themselves, including hiding their religious affiliations or attempting to pre-empt criticism or bullying by representing the traditions they identified with in an apologetic conciliatory manner. Religion's status Research shows that events that undermine the status of a religion decrease religious identification. For example, abuse scandals in the Catholic church have been shown to reduce Catholic identification. This reduction in religious identification was strongest among individuals who identify as Black, are from low-income families, and whose parents have lower levels of education. Religious identity trajectories By and large, numerous studies have observed ethnic, gender, and generational differences in religious identity. However, there have not been as many longitudinal studies on the influence of ethnicity, gender, and generational status on individuals' development of religious identity over time. Nevertheless, of the handful of such studies, researchers have focused mainly on adolescence and started to branch out to emerging adulthood. Adolescence Researchers have been particularly interested in studying identity during adolescence because it is a developmental period crucial to identity development. During this period, adolescents have opportunities to explore their ethnic, cultural, and religious traditions. However, the freedom and flexibility of their exploration is typically within the constraints of their parents or caregiver. It was believed that religious identity and participation would both follow the same trajectory and decrease across time; hence, the studies that examined religiousness, which combines the two constructs. Although religious affiliation, identity, and participation are closely related, longitudinal research on adolescents suggests that these constructs have different trajectories from one another. For example, researchers have found that religious affiliation and identity for adolescents remained fairly stable across the high school years, which contradicts the expected change in religious affiliation from affiliated to unaffiliated and decrease in religious identity. However, the stability of adolescent religious identity parallels that of other social identities such as ethnic identity. Researchers have reasoned that due to adolescents' relatively stable social environment , there is not a strong need to further explore and renegotiate their religious identity. Moreover, religious identity is mainly driven by parents during adolescence. Given that adolescents tend to still live with their parents during high school, there may not be a need to engage in deeper exploration of their religion, which may help explain the observed stable religious identity. Whereas religious affiliation and identity remain stable, religious participation tends to decrease. Adolescents may exercise their increased autonomy and choose not to attend religious events. Particularly, adolescents may find other activities (e.g. studying, clubs, and sports) vying for their time and resources and choose to prioritize those activities over religious events. The significant decline in religious participation at the end of high school may be a precursor to further decline during emerging adulthood. Emerging adulthood Adolescence has been traditionally associated with a time of identity exploration. However, that exploration process is not complete by the end of adolescence. Rather, emerging adulthood, the years between late teens and late twenties, extends the identity formation process from adolescence. This transitional period is marked by constant changes in romantic love, work, and worldviews and is generally a time of \"semiautonomy.\" With this increased sense of autonomy, emerging adults may choose to further exert their independence by moving away from home and/or by attending college. Through whichever ways that emerging adults choose to exercise their autonomy, they are likely to find themselves in new, diverse environments teeming with a spectrum of vast worldviews. Despite the necessity for studies on religious identity, there has been limited work on the role of religion in identity formation in emerging adults. Compared to the research in adolescence, there is much less work on the development of religious identity and religious participation across the emerging adulthood years. The combination of immense and frequent changes, increased autonomy, and diverse environments during this period has major ramifications for the development of emerging adults' religious affiliation, religious identity, and religious participation. In the period of emerging adulthood individuals gain a more complex understanding of religious ideas which can lead to periods of questioning, doubt, and conversion. These periods of change in emerging adulthood can lead to longer-term religious ideologies Religion was believed to have little impact on emerging adults' identity, particularly for those who attend college However, recent research suggests otherwise. According to a study, while 14 percent of college students reported a decrease in religious beliefs throughout college, 48 percent reported stable religious beliefs, and 38 percent reported an increase. Moreover, another study found that contrary to the expectations of decreased religious identity and religious participation during emerging adulthood, religious identity did not decrease, but religious participation did decline as predicted. Researchers explained that emerging adults are more likely to decrease their involvement in religious activities than they are to completely disaffiliate from their religion or express less importance of religion in their lives. Additionally, in a study that examined the ways in which religion influenced emerging adults, researchers found that emerging adults' standards of adulthood were dependent upon the religious affiliation of the institution they attended. For example, compared to emerging adults who attended Catholic or public universities, emerging adults who attended Mormon universities rated interdependence, norm compliance, biological transitions, and family capacities as extremely important criteria for adulthood. In summary, although not all studies on this topic are in agreement, religious identity generally tends to remain stable during emerging adulthood whereas religious participation decreases over time.

{"id": "doc_random_132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Duck_Dodgers_characters", "text": "This is a list of characters from the American animated television series Duck Dodgers . Galactic Protectorate Duck Dodgers Main article: Duck Dodgers Captain Daffy Edgar Dumas Aloysius Eoghain \"the Duck\" Dodgers is the main character of the show. He was voiced by Joe Alaskey and \"portrayed\" by Daffy Duck . Duck Dodgers was accidentally frozen for over three centuries. He was revived by Dr. I.Q. Hi in the middle of the 24th century. Through scheming and lies, he managed to trick everyone into believing he was a 21st-century hero. In reality, he was only a water boy for a college football team. He is arrogant, rude, selfish, greedy, lazy, cowardly, gullible, and not particularly intelligent. He occasionally displays surprisingly high levels of heroism and competence, suggesting that he is not quite as daft as he appears to be, although he mostly succeeds through dumb luck and the work of the Eager Young Space Cadet. Ironically, Commander X-2 actually caused Dodgers to become a minor football star in the final game of the season, which is what he used to parlay himself into captaincy in the Protectorate, meaning that he is, technically, not lying when he claims he won a championship football game in his own time. His running gag tends to be that he develops crushes on various women, who almost always hate him. Cadet Main article: Porky Pig Eager Young Space Cadet Porky C. Joey \"the Pig\" Paide is the faithful sidekick of Duck Dodgers. He was voiced by Bob Bergen . Cadet looks up to Dodgers, seeing him as a father-figure in many ways. He is utterly loyal to Dodgers and doesn't doubt a word he says. Despite being much smarter than his so-called hero, Cadet lets Dodgers give all the orders. Dodgers cares deeply for Cadet, though he rarely shows it. Dodgers relies heavily on the Cadet's assistance and would likely fail most missions without it; he often tries to take credit for the Cadet's work. Cadet is also fairly successful as a ladies' man, often being the one who ends up with the woman Dodgers swoons over. He graduated summa cum laude from the Protectorate Academy. Very little else is known about his past, though one episode portrays him as being the Prince and Ruler of his home planet of Swinus 9. Another episode reveals that Cadet's sister was sold to the sausage factory (by Dodgers), and villains trying to dethrone or otherwise eliminate him. However, Cadet reveals this background by telling a story to his overly rambunctious niece and nephews who expressed no prior knowledge of this. It is unknown whether or not this is true or just his attempt to impress his relatives. He claimed to Count Muerte that he ended world hunger, though this could be seen as bragging to a stranger. I.Q. Hi Dr. Ignatius Q. \"I.Q.\" Hi is the scientist that revives Dodgers after being frozen for three centuries. He is the Chief Scientist for the Galactic Protectorate and usually acts as a representative on Earth on behalf of the World President. Hi is responsible for giving missions to the team. Serious and hard-working, he is often irritated and frustrated with Dodgers's incompetent side, and doubts that Dodgers truly was a 21st-century hero. Once a year, he serves as a cadet for one flight on Dodger's ship in order to evaluate Dodger's command. In college, he majored in Pointless Minutiae, which his mother warned him against. He also has a slight potassium deficiency. I.Q. Hi first appeared in Duck Dodgers in the 24\u00bdth Century , as the Secretary of the Stratosphere who briefs Duck Dodgers. He also appeared in the sequel, Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24\u00bdth Century . In both cartoons, he was voiced by Mel Blanc . His overall design was changed in the TV series. In the shorts, he was originally fat and wore a blue laboratory coat. In the new series, he wears a traditional white lab coat and is rarely seen without gloves that extend to his elbow and leave a gap between his fingertips and the glove's tips. He also has a higher-pitched, more throaty voice which was provided by Richard McGonagle . Hi is bald beneath his lightbulb-hat. Later episodes also show that I.Q. Hi owns an old castle inherited from his ancestors (which is later destroyed by Dodgers), enjoys lattes , fishing, and despite their rivalries, appears to be on friendly terms with Queen Tyr'ahnee. He also has a brother named Psy Q. Hi, who is a psychiatrist . Dr. I.Q. Hi may be loosely based on the character of Dr. Huer in the Buck Rogers comic strip that Dodgers parodies. Hi's physical appearance mimics that of Larry Fine . In addition to the Duck Dodgers series, I.Q. Hi also made a guest cameo on Tiny Toon Adventures in the segment \"Duck Dodgers, Jr.\", featured in the episode \"The Return to the Acme Acres Zone\". Here, he briefs Dodgers and Plucky Duck (appearing as Dodgers' sidekick) on the matter transmogrifier that Marvin is using to suck up the universe; he is then sucked up himself by the transmogrifier. In this cameo, I.Q. Hi's appearance, voiced by Jeff Bergman , was closer to that of the original cartoons. Dr. I.Q. Hi also appeared in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System title Daffy Duck: The Marvin Missions in which he appeared briefly in some in-between stage newspaper headline photos and (possibly) briefs Dodgers on his mission before each stage. He later appears as a boss, brainwashed by Marvin the Martian and strapped into a large war machine on the third planet's final area. The newspaper headline after the battle depicts I.Q. Hi (still under the effects of being brainwashed) being recruited as Dodgers' new cadet. Captain Star Johnson Captain Star Johnson is a member of the Space Protectorate who serves as a rival to Duck Dodgers. Johnson is a rival captain of Dodger's in the Galactic Protectorate. Johnson has a University education and played collegiate rocketball. His personality is like that of Flash Gordon . Johnson once took Dodgers to court over Dodger's incompetence. Since then, Johnson has been involved in freeing Mars from the military coup by General Z9 and searching for gangsters when Dodgers went missing for a brief period of time. Captain Long Captain Long is a member of the Galactic Protectorate. He appeared in \"The Fudd\" where he was one of the victims of the Mother Fudd. He was voiced by Michael Dorn . Captain Dallas Rodman Captain Dallas Rodman is a member of the Galactic Protectorate. Rodman appeared in only one episode, \"The Best of Captains, The Worst of Captains\" where he was nominated for Captain of the Year at the Galactic Protectorate's Captainee Awards. He closely resembled Buzz Lightyear . Rodman was voiced by Frank Welker . Captain Aurora Soleil Captain Aurora Soleil served as a lieutenant in the Galactic Protectorate. At the Captainee Awards, Duck Dodgers and Star Johnson competed for her attention. At the awards, she was promoted to Captain for her heroic actions. Cadet voted for her in the \"Captain of the Year\" category. Soleil is based on Wilma Deering . Master Sergeant Emily Dickinson Jones Master Sergeant Emily Dickinson Jones works at the Galactic Protectorate Training Academy on Earth. He is responsible for monitoring Duck Dodgers during his annual Protectorate Training Test, which Dodgers routinely avoids taking. He takes great pride in molding lazy Captains (like Dodgers) into decent shape to fight for the Protectorate, enjoying their suffering during training. However, he respects individuals who can think out of the box which is why Sgt. Jones let Dodgers pass the test despite the fact Dodgers managed to fail every one of the tests. Jones was voiced by Randy Savage . Bigfoot In \"The Six Wazillion Dollar Duck\" (a parody of The Six Million Dollar Man ), it was revealed that Bigfoot worked for the Protectorate as a Maintenance Supervisor and was also the first being to receive cyborgan implants. Due to enhanced combat abilities, as he was able hold off several centurions before they baited and trapped him with pie. He seems not to be very educated, as the only two words he says are \"Duck\" and \"Stereo\". When Dodgers thwarted the Martians, Dr. Maniac escaped with Bigfoot and were seen in the fast food business. On the \"Bonafide Heroes\" show, Dr. Maniac and Bigfoot were seen being interviewed in jail. Bigfoot was voiced by Michael Patrick McGill . Martian Empire Queen Tyr'ahnee Queen Tyr'ahnee is the ruler of Mars . She is shown as a competent ruler who, much unlike the rival President of Space, actually leaves the safety of the government buildings at times. Though at times she dislikes him, she is in love with Dodgers and, just like Cadet, believes him to be a true hero. She and Dodgers planned to marry until X-2 persuaded Dodgers to leave the Queen. She never quite got over her feelings for Dodgers, to the point of deserting Commander X-2 at their own wedding. She is shown to be good friends with I.Q. Hi, knowing and calling him by his first name, Ignatius, on many occasions. Tyr'ahnee wears outfits reminiscent of ancient Egyptian royal garb. Her name is pronounced similar to \"tyranny.\" Like all Martians, she has a British accent . She was voiced by Tia Carrere . Martian Commander X-2 Main article: Marvin the Martian Martian Commander X-2 Marvin is the commander of the Martian military. He is never named outside his official capacity as the Commander (possibly High Commander) of the fleet of Mars . He essentially created Duck Dodgers by going back in time and making Dodgers a hero so as to not be proven wrong by the queen. X-2 is Dodgers' archenemy, though X-2 considers Dodgers more of a nuisance than a true enemy. X-2 serves the Martian Queen Tyr'ahnee, with whom he is infatuated and loyal to. His crush is not requited for most of the series, until in the end of the second season, when the Queen kissed X2 in the cheek after learning of his crush, something he found so delighted. Even at their wedding, the Queen chooses Dodgers over X-2, even after X-2 risks his life to save Dodgers from the Legion of Duck Doom. Also, despite their rivalry with each other, both Dodgers and X-2 have worked together in several occasions to fight against more evil villains in general; Dodgers even manages to rescue X-2 from the wrath of the treacherous Martian General Z-9. X-2's interests include piano music, singing, cooking, and possibly linguistics. He is also shown to be obsessively tidy and an avid worker. X-2 is also an avid scientist and inventor, creating many machines that assist the stories. He is also shown to have a fear of heights due to childhood trauma and to be very protective of his mother, apparently calling or sending her messages up to five times a day. X-2 is also the constant target of the centurions' robot jokes, who imply several times in the series that X-2 is not alright in his head and has issues with \"strong independent women\" (ie. the Martian Queen). Martian Commander X-2 was played by Marvin the Martian and was voiced by Joe Alaskey . Commander K-9 Martian Commander K-9 is Martian Commander X-2's dog. He is loyal and loving and will do anything for his master. He'll always protect his master from danger, even if it makes K-9 look bad in front of him. K-9 is proven to be ticklish when Martian Gophers tickle his belly and chin. K-9's vocal effects were provided by Frank Welker . Martian General Z-9 Martian General Z-9 is a well-known general of the Martian military. He serves as the villain of the final two episodes of the second season. He initially served for the Martian Queen and Martian Commander X-2, but secretly plotted to take over both Earth and Mars as their new ruler after a peace meeting between Earth and Mars went off bad thanks to Dodgers' antics. To start off, Z-9 managed to capture Star Johnson after the latter learns of the general's plot. Z-9 then staged a military coup on Mars by taking the Martian Queen as prisoner and sending X-2 on the run as a wanted criminal, declaring himself the new Martian King and Commander.

The country-wide TOW organization was active in the early days of the September 1939 Campaign and during the Nazi occupation of Poland . Some of the offshoots or independently organized local \"TOWs\", such as Tajna Organizacja Wojskowa Gryf Pomorski (\"TOW Pomeranian Griffin \") or Tajna Organizacja Wojskowa Gryf Kaszubski (\"TOW Kaszubian Griffin \") were active throughout the whole period of the German occupation as well as the early years of the Soviet takeover. During the interwar period, Polish intelligence services in the Grupa Operacyjnej Dywersji (Operational Group for Diversion) developed contingency plans for creating an underground movement in case the country was occupied by either Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia . The sub unit within this service codenamed Zygmunt was charged with preparing diversionary and sabotage actions to be carried out during the possible occupation. The main, country-wide, TOW was organized by Major (later colonel) Jan Mazurkiewicz , codename Rados\u0142aw , in late 1939, in Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w , after the Polish defeat in the September campaign . Mazurkiewicz's founding of the group received approval from Gen. W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski and the Polish government in exile . Originally the coordinating headquarters of this TOW were located in Budapest , but were transferred to occupied Poland in 1940. In March 1943 the main TOW became part of the general anti-Nazi organization the Home Army and the cells of the organization were transformed or transferred into the newly organized \"Directorate for Diversion\", Kedyw . Some of the other TOWs, such as the Pomeranian Griffin, continued to exist independently of the Home Army, or were only nominally subordinated to it.

It was chosen as Best Film at the Grand Bell Awards . It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section of the 1984 Cannes Film Festival . The film was also selected as the South Korean entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 57th Academy Awards , but was not accepted as a nominee. Plot A historical drama about the life of a widow. 15th century life was sometimes cruel to Korean women and this story depicts a lot of the injustices that could occur as happening to Kil-Rye, the heroine. Cast Won Mi-kyung : Gillye Shin Il-ryong : Yun-bo Moon Jung-suk : Mother Choe Sung-kwan: Father Park Min-ho Choe Seong-ho Moon Mi-bong Yang Chun Hyun Kill-soo Choe Jeong-won Critical reception Comment on contemporary reactions to this film: There was a great deal of controversy in the Korean media when this film came out, saying that this work did not represent Korea well. Some objected to the shade of the lead actress' skin, saying that she looked too dark for a Korean. Whiteness of skin was and is still considered important among many in Korea. Others scoffed that it was unlikely that all of the injustices depicted could have happened to one woman. However, it is a vivid and visually spectacular depiction of the struggles many women went through in that time period. The film also polarized audiences and stirred controversy when it was shown at the East\u2013West Center and the Fifth International Film Festival in Honolulu.

{"id": "doc_random_137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tet%C3%ADn_(Beroun_District)", "text": "Tet\u00edn is a municipality and village in Beroun District in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic . It has about 900 inhabitants. Administrative division Koda hamlet Tet\u00edn consists of two municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census): Tet\u00edn (820) Koda (3) Etymology The name is derived from the personal name Teta, meaning \"Teta's (castle/court)\". Geography Tet\u00edn is located about 2 kilometres (1\u00a0mi) south of Beroun and 23\u00a0km (14\u00a0mi) southwest of Prague . It lies in the Ho\u0159ovice Uplands . The highest point is the hill Tobolsk\u00fd vrch at 467\u00a0m (1,532\u00a0ft) above sea level. The municipality is situated on the right bank of the Berounka River, which forms the municipal border. Most of the territory lies in the Bohemian Karst Protected Landscape Area. The Koda National Nature Reserve with the Bohemian Karst occupies almost half of the municipal territory. Along the Berounka there is also the Tet\u00ednsk\u00e9 sk\u00e1ly Nature Reserve. History Tet\u00edn is one of the oldest villages in the Czech Republic. There is a legend that connects Tet\u00edn with the mythological figure Teta (the daughter of the mythological Duke Krok ), who was supposed to have lived here. The place was already inhabited during the Paleolithic period . Archaeologists found that the beginnings of the village date back to the 10th century, when local gord was founded by dukes from the P\u0159emyslid dynasty . In the 10th century, the duchess Ludmila of Bohemia raised St. Wenceslaus in the gord. She was murdered here in 921. In 1288, Tet\u00edn was the residence of the royal hunter and towards the end of the 13th century, the castle was rebuilt as a residence for the royal bastards of the P\u0159emyslid line. By 1321, Tet\u00edn Castle was owned by \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n of Tet\u00edn, who later sold it to Emperor Charles IV . The latter then joined the Tet\u00edn estate to Karl\u0161tejn . In 1422, during the Hussite Wars , the castle was destroyed. In the late Middle Ages, the importance of Tet\u00edn declined, but it remained a frequented pilgrimage site. In the second half of the 19th century, limestone mining began near Tet\u00edn. This caused economic development and an influx of new residents. Demographics Transport The railway line Prague\u2013Beroun runs through the municipality, but there is no train station. Sights Church of Saint Ludmila The Church of Saint Catherine of Alexandria is the smallest church in Tet\u00edn. This Romanesque church was founded around 1200 and renewed in 1858. The Church of Saint Ludmila was built in the early Baroque style in 1685 next to the Church of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. The Church of Saint John of Nepomuk was originally a Romanesque church from the 12th\u201313th centuries. In the 17th century, it was baroque rebuilt. Until 1836, it was consecrated to Saint Michael. Today the church is desecrated and houses a gallery. Several ruins have been preserved from the original Tet\u00edn Castle. They are freely accessible. The Tet\u00edn Castle is a Neoclassical castle from the end of the 18th century. Today it is privately owned and inaccessible to the public. Notable people Ludmila of Bohemia ( c. \u2009860 \u2013921), duchess, martyr and saint; died here Wenceslaus Hajek (?\u20131553), chronicler; lived and worked here in 1533\u20131539 References ^ \"Population of Municipalities \u2013 1 January 2025\" .

Onosai was drafted by the National Football League (NFL)'s Dallas Cowboys . He reached the finals of the World's Strongest Man competition twice (1994 and 1995). Early years Onosai attended University Laboratory School where he was a 240-pound fullback . As a junior, he averaged 13.8 yards per carry. In 1982 as a senior, he helped the Pac-Five football team win its first Interscholastic League of Honolulu and Prep Bowl championship (predecessor to the state tournament) and was named The Advertiser's ILH Offensive Player of the Year. He received a scholarship to play for the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa , where he was converted into an offensive guard as a freshman. He was named a starter as a sophomore. The next year because of injuries on the offensive line, he also started at tackle and center, including a game against Long Beach State University where he played all three position. Sometimes he was used as a fullback in short-yardage situations. As a senior, he was moved to center and received honorable-mention All-American honors. He was a second-team All-Western Athletic Conference performer in 1985 and 1986. Professional career Onosai was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the sixth round (151st overall) of the 1987 NFL draft to play center . During a practice in training camp, he suffered a serious neck injury and was subsequently diagnosed with a narrow spinal column condition ( cervical spinal stenosis ), which forced him to announce his early retirement on August 1, 1987 . It would eventually take four days for the strength in his legs to return and two years to get his upper-body strength back to normal. World's Strongest Man competition He participated in the World's Strongest Man competition for many years. At 6-feet-4 and 400 pounds, he developed a 65-inch chest, 22-inch biceps and the power lift was his specialty. He made it to the finals twice, in 1994 and 1995.

{"id": "doc_random_142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_H._Trapier", "text": "James Heyward Trapier (November 24, 1815 \u2013 December 21, 1865) was a career United States Army officer, who fought during the Mexican\u2013American War . He also served as a Confederate general during the American Civil War , dying shortly after its conclusion. Early life and career Trapier was born in 1815 at a plantation called \"Windsor,\" located along the Black River near the city of Georgetown, South Carolina . In 1834, he attended the United States Military Academy at West Point , and graduated four years later, standing third out of 45 cadets. P.G.T. Beauregard , whom Trapier would serve under later in life, placed second in this same class. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Artillery on July 1, 1838. Six days later, Trapier transferred to the Engineer Corps , and he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant on July 1, 1839. He was a cousin of Thomas F. Drayton . In his work for the Engineers, Trapier helped in the construction of defenses on the coastline of the United States. He also served in the Mexican\u2013American War from 1846\u20131848, and he would resign his commission on February 28, 1848. After tendering his resignation, Trapier moved back to his plantation in South Carolina and became a planter. He also was active in the South Carolina State Militia , rising to the rank of colonel and serving as the militia's aide-de-camp . As the chief of ordnance of South Carolina, Trapier \"ensured that the state was well-armed.\" Civil War service At the start of the American Civil War in 1861, Trapier chose to follow his home state and the Confederate cause . He entered the Confederate Army in January, assigned as a captain in the Engineers as well as aide-de-camp to South Carolina's Governor Francis W. Pickens . He then began his service under Brig. Gen. Beauregard, becoming part of his staff in April and Chief Engineer of the newly formed Department of South Carolina until November. While there he aided Beauregard in the construction of artillery batteries within Charleston Harbor , and on June 19 he was promoted to major and was assigned assistant quartermaster . Trapier was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on October 21, 1861. He was given command the District of Middle and Eastern Florida from November 5 until March 14 of the following year. He then was ordered to the Western Theater and Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston 's Army of the Mississippi , with Brig. Gen. Joseph Finegan taking over his district command in April. Trapier was assigned to lead the 4th Brigade of the 2nd Division in Maj. Gen. Braxton Bragg 's II Corps in March. Gen. Beauregard assumed command of the Army of the Mississippi upon Johnston's death at Shiloh and led it during the First Battle of Corinth in late April. Trapier was then temporarily given command of the 1st Division of the I Corps on April 14 when its commander, Charles Clark , fell ill. When Clark recovered, Trapier was then given temporary command of the 2nd Division of Bragg's II Corps, and led it in this capacity during the Battle of Farmington . Trapier's performance during the Union siege at Corinth was highly criticized and Bragg, now the army commander, ordered him relieved of command and sent him home for duty in South Carolina. In November 1862, Trapier was given command of the Fourth Military District of South Carolina, headquartered in Georgetown. This district encompassed the area from the North Carolina line to the Santee River. Trapier strengthened the defense of this district by placing troops in coastal fortifications, notably Battery White , which guarded Winyah Bay . In April 1863, Trapier was called by Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard, who at this time commanded at Charleston, to command the garrison located on Sullivan's Island during Union Admiral Samuel DuPonts' naval assault on the city. DuPont's attack failed and, with Charleston safe, Trapier reported back to Georgetown. After April 1863, Trapier performed well in the command of the district although constantly plagued by a lack of supplies and troops. Trapier asked the Confederate government repeatedly for extra troops to defend this district; however, the government allocated what extra troops it had to more active theaters. Trapier's district was unmolested until February 25, 1865, when Union Admiral John Dahlgren's fleet sailed into Georgetown's harbor and captured the town. Trapier evacuated the town and its outlying fortifications previous to its occupation in concurrence with the surrender of Charleston. On March 1, 1865, Admiral Dahlgren's flagship, the USS Harvest Moon , struck a torpedo that had been placed there by Trapier's orders. The admiral was uninjured but the Harvest Moon sank. There is no record showing Gen. Trapier was ever captured or paroled. Trapier was not with Confederate forces under Gen. Joseph Johnston in North Carolina at the time of surrender. Postbellum and death After the end of the war, Trapier returned to farming in South Carolina. He died at the age of 50 during the winter of 1865 at the home of a friend in Georgetown. He was buried there in the cemetery of Prince George Winyah Churchyard .

{"id": "doc_random_144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere,_Wiltshire", "text": "Mere is a market town and civil parish in Wiltshire , England. It lies at the extreme southwestern tip of Salisbury Plain , close to the borders of Somerset and Dorset . The parish includes the hamlets of Barrow Street , Burton , Charnage , Limpers Hill , Rook Street and Southbrook . The A303 trunk road passed through Mere until a bypass was built on the northern edge of the town in 1976. There is an old market square (although markets have not been held for several years), a chiming town clock and a large Grade I listed parish church. The steep slope of Castle Hill rises from the northwestern side of the town. History Evidence of prehistoric activity in the area is provided by bowl barrows , including four on Long Hill, overlooking the town. On the northwestern boundary of the parish is Whitesheet Hill , with barrows and an Iron Age hill fort , White Sheet camp. A burial dating from either the 7th or 8th has been found in the town. The name Mere may reflect the presence of a mere , a pond or small lake; or it may derive from the Old English m\u01e3re meaning 'boundary' as the town is near the tripoint of Wiltshire , Somerset and Dorset . Mere had a church from the end of the 12th century. The Earl of Cornwall built Mere Castle on a hill which is connected to Long Hill, overlooking the town, in the mid-13th century. The castle was abandoned in the 14th century and today only earthworks remain. The Duchy of Cornwall still owns much land in the area. Mere Down, north of the town, has medieval strip lynchets . Governance The civil parish elects a town council . It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority , which performs most significant local government functions. An electoral ward with the same name exists. The ward starts in the east at West Knoyle , stretches through Mere, continues to Zeals and finishes in the northwest at Kilmington . The population of the ward taken from the 2011 census was 4,285. Religious sites Parish church St Michael's Church The Anglican church of St Michael the Archangel is from the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, and contains remnants from an earlier building. Pevsner describes the church and its furnishings in considerable detail. The church has a 124-foot (38-metre) tower with eight bells and is unusual in that it has 10 misericords ; those on the south side of the choir date from the 15th century, whilst those on the north side are early 20th century. Restoration in 1856 was by T.H. Wyatt . In 1966 the church was designated as Grade I listed . The benefice was combined with West Knoyle in 1929, and Maiden Bradley in 1976, forming the parish of Mere with West Knoyle and Maiden Bradley. Others Mere Methodist Church was built as a Primitive Methodist chapel in 1846; a gallery was added in 1859 and a schoolroom in 1874. It was de-consecrated in 2017 and sold at auction in April 2018. It has been converted for residential use. Mere United Reformed Church was built in 1868 as a Congregational chapel, joining the United Reformed Church at its formation in 1972. Precursors of the present building were a small Presbyterian chapel of 1700, an Independent chapel of 1795 and a larger chapel of 1852. The church of St Matthew was built in 1882 by C.E. Ponting , on a rural site at White Hill, 1 + 1 \u2044 4 miles (2 kilometres) southeast of the town. It was a mission church, served by the clergy of St Michael's. The church closed in 2004 and was sold for residential use in 2008. St Mary's Roman Catholic church was built in 1946 after the community purchased a surplus Nissen hut . Notable buildings Woodlands Manor, 3 \u2044 4 mile (1.2 kilometres) south of the town, is a Grade I listed manor house and chapel from the 14th century, which was restored to its 17th-century appearance in the 20th century. Buildings designated as Grade II* are the Old Ship Hotel, formerly a house dated 1711, later the Ship Inn; the Chantry, a 15th-century house for chantry priests ; and Dewes House, 17th century. Schools The town has a primary school. The local secondary school is Gillingham School , Dorset, about 3 + 1 \u2044 2 miles (5.5 kilometres) away. The present school was opened in 1965 at a new site, on Duchy of Cornwall land, as Duchy Manor Secondary School. Accommodation for younger children was added on the same site in 1992 and in 2004 the whole premises became the primary school. Earlier schools were, firstly, the British School, founded c. 1830 and from 1852 housed in the schoolroom under the new Congregational chapel, later taking over the whole building when the larger adjacent chapel was built in 1868. Secondly, the National School , opened near St Michael's in 1840, extended 1864, and augmented in 1899 by the adjacent Grove Building which was funded by Miss Julia Chafyn Grove of Zeals House. The schools amalgamated in 1922 and continued on the same sites as Mere First School (until 1992) and Mere Senior School, later Junior School (until 1972). Media Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West and ITV West Country . Television signals are received from the Mendip TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Wiltshire , BBC Radio Solent can also be heard in the town, Heart West , Vale FM , and Alfred Radio, a community based station which broadcast from Shaftesbury . The town is served by the local newspapers, Warminster Journal and Wiltshire Times . Economy and amenities The Hillbrush company was established in Mere in 1922, and continues to make brushes and other forms of cleaning equipment in a modern factory on the western edge of the town. The town's library and museum are housed in the 1839 National School building, which was converted in 1970. The Monarch's Way long-distance recreational footpath passes through the town. The town is part of the West Country Carnival circuit. The nearest railway station is in neighbouring Gillingham , Dorset, on the Exeter to Waterloo line.

{"id": "doc_random_146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Vinci%27s_Notebook", "text": "Da Vinci's Notebook (or simply DVN ) was a comedic a cappella singing group. Former Artists-in-Residence at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts , they performed specials on Comedy Central and PBS , and spent time as the \"house band\" on Washington radio's WBIG-FM . They were also regular guests on the nationally syndicated Bob and Tom radio show. History Formation and first years (1993\u20131997) In Alexandria, Virginia , during the summer of 1993, Bernie Muller-Thym, Greg \"Storm\" DiCostanzo, Paul Sabourin and Richard Hsu banded together to join a six-man a cappella group that was advertised in the Washington City Paper . Muller-Thym, DiCostanzo, and Sabourin met through the newspaper ad, while Hsu was a friend of DiConstanzo from the University of Maryland . The six-man group did not last and disbanded soon after. Muller-Thym, DiCostanzo, Sabourin, and Hsu then formed Da Vinci's Notebook. Bass singer Jay Jones joined later in the year, singing with the group until 1994. Da Vinci's Notebook made their debut at the 1994 Mid-Atlantic Harmony Sweepstakes , where they came in third place. In 1997, they came back and won the competition. In 1995, the group self-released their debut cassette EP Somebody Else's Greatest Hits , featuring covers of popular songs. Bendy's Law (1997) Da Vinci's Notebook released their first full-length studio album, Bendy's Law , in 1997, featuring guest appearances by Richard Greene and Joe Finetti of The Bobs , as well as by the band Moxy Fr\u00fcvous . The Life and Times of Mike Fanning (1999-2001) The group's second full-length album, The Life and Times of Mike Fanning , was released on December 1, 1999. The album was produced by Richard Greene, who additionally provided vocals and previously made a guest appearance on \"Bendy's Law\". Other guest performances include Ball in the House and Michael Clem, Eddie Hartness, and Julie Murphy Wells from Eddie from Ohio . The Life and Times of Mike Fanning occasionally utilizes musical instruments as part of the backing tracks, which was new to the group's albums. Around this time, the group's members also quit their day jobs to perform full time. Prior to performing full time, Hsu was a system engineer, Sabourin was a graphic specialist at a law firm, Muller-Thym was an accountant, and DiCostanzo was a financial analyst. The Washington Post made several articles about them during and after the release of The Life and Times of Mike Fanning . \"Enormous Penis\", rise in popularity and Brontosaurus (2001-2002) In 2001, the song \"Enormous Penis\" was released as the group's first and only single. Around this time, interest in the band spiked as they began to get played on the syndicated Bob and Tom radio show. The appearance on the show led to high demand for the single. Their signature songs played on the show included \"Another Irish Drinking Song\", \"Ally McBeal\", \"Enormous Penis\", \"Liposuction\", \"Face Like Billy Joel\" and \"Title of the Song\". \"Enormous Penis\" remains Da Vinci's Notebook's most popular song. The group released their final album, Brontosaurus , in the following year, which included \"Enormous Penis\". It was produced by Richard Greene, who had previously produced The Life and Times of Mike Fanning . Guest appearances include Eddie Hartness and Robbie Schaefer of Eddie from Ohio, Valerie Vigoda from GrooveLily , and a cappella singer-songwriter Sean Altman . The newfound popularity brought by the Bob and Tom Show brought more critics and fans to the album, with the album releasing to positive reviews. The album was the band's final full release before disbanding in 2004. Final years, disbandment, and legacy (2002-present) The group toured, locally and nationally, for ten years. Highlights included some of the most prestigious folk venues and festivals on the East Coast, such as the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival . In 2004, the band stopped touring and regular performances. Two of the members, Sabourin and DiCostanzo, then began touring as the musical duo Paul and Storm . In addition to their albums, Da Vinci's Notebook also recorded a track called \"The Ballad of The Sneak\" for the Homestar Runner cartoon website. This song was credited to the entire group, though it was only written and performed by Paul and Storm . In 2013, the group's song \"Another Irish Drinking Song\" was featured in the film Despicable Me 2 , with new lyrics in the language of the Minions.

The various models are all equally valid or true, though some may be more useful or attractive than others. The opposite view is the \"universe\" view of set theory in which all sets are contained in some single ultimate model. The collection of countable transitive models of ZFC (in some universe) is called the hyperverse and is very similar to the \"multiverse\". A typical difference between the universe and multiverse views is the attitude to the continuum hypothesis . In the universe view the continuum hypothesis is a meaningful question that is either true or false though we have not yet been able to decide which. In the multiverse view it is meaningless to ask whether the continuum hypothesis is true or false before selecting a model of set theory. Another difference is that the statement \"For every transitive model of ZFC there is a larger model of ZFC in which it is countable\" is true in some versions of the multiverse view of mathematics but is false in the universe view.

Moonstone Beach Moonstone Beach was a tourist attraction in the beach community of Redondo Beach, California from the late 1880s to the early 1920s. Historical attraction Polished moonstone specimen Storms had deposited the moonstones along the beach from the Hermosa Beach city boundary south to about Diamond Street in Redondo Beach. Moonstones belong to the mineral family of feldspars that provide almost two-thirds of all stones on Earth. As the City of Redondo Beach took shape, visitors day-tripping from Los Angeles as well as tourists from the East Coast gathered the moonstones from the many mounds of gemstones washed ashore. It was a popular pastime for amateurs and gemologists alike. Although not very attractive in their natural state, the stones could be cut and polished into beautiful jewelry. One such case involved a local carpenter who sent a moonstone brooch in 1911 to his fianc\u00e9 living in New York City. The carpenter persuaded his fianc\u00e9 to join him in Southern California as his bride as he bragged about the beautiful moonstones washing up on the local beaches. Over-harvesting and decline Builders soon found that the stones were useful for more than just jewelry. The sand and stones became components of streets, sidewalks and foundations. It is believed that 10,000 loads of the stones were crushed and used in the foundation of the Southern California Edison plant built in Redondo Beach in 1907. At the urging of the Redondo Beach Chamber, the Los Angeles & Redondo Railway Co. served notice to companies hauling away the sand and stones to discontinue the practice. The desire was to preserve the Moonstone Beach as a tourist attraction. Much of the damage had already been done. With the addition of breakwaters, dredging, and a harbor in the late 1950s, the contour of the Redondo Beach waterfront has changed and moonstones are no longer deposited along its shores. Legacy Due to the popularity of the gemstones, local streets were named to honor Moonstone Beach in the late 1880s. Beginning just south of the popular beach, streets running east\u2013west feature gemstone names alphabetically such as Agate, Beryl, Carnelian, Diamond, Emerald, Garnet, Jasper, Opal, Pearl, Ruby, Sapphire, and Topaz. In commemoration of the popular beach, the City of Redondo Beach has designated a small parcel of land within the harbor as Moonstone Park.

{"id": "doc_random_156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gale_(theologian)", "text": "John Gale (1680\u20131721) was a British Baptist theologian . He was not widely known until the controversy over William Wall's work on infant baptism appeared. He studied at Leiden University and received a Master of Arts degree and Ph.D. in 1699. After studying at Leiden, Gale went to Amsterdam , where he met Le Clerc . Leiden offered him a doctor of divinity if he agreed to Puritan doctrine. He would not, on principle. His work against infant baptism was composed in 1705\u20131706 as a series of letters to Wall. These were collected and published in 1711 as Reflections on Mr. Wall's History of Infant Baptism. Gale was a superb scholar of Hebrew , Greek and Latin , and he combatted Wall's patristic readings by arguing that the antiquity of infant baptism is not certain. He also accused Wall of doing what Wall said he most sought to avoid: elevating a minor doctrinal point into a matter of schism . William Wotton praised Gale's work. Gale began preaching at Paul's Alley Barbican, but he was never ordained and would not accept a regular position. Instead, he traveled from one Baptist congregation to another, speaking. He also joined the \"Society for Promoting Primitive Christianity.\" He was introduced to Benjamin Hoadly and the Lord Chancellor Peter King . In 1721, when he was just forty-one years old, he caught a fever and died. He left little money for his widow, and congregationalists collected a subscription to enable her to open a coffee shop in Finch Lane, London.

Background Hijgenaar is a former speed skater who for two years was in the Netherlands national team. In 2001, she switched from skating to track cycling after finding she rode so much better than she skated that she could often ride by male riders in training. When her former skating teammates made technical advances better than she could, she stayed permanently in cycling. \"When I look at the number of national championships, world championships and an Olympic Games that I've ridden, I am happy with my choice,\" she said. Olympic Games Hijgenaar represented the Netherlands at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens where she took part in the individual sprint as well as the 500 metres time trial. She did not impress in the individual sprint where she finished 11th. However, her 500 metres time trial time of 34.532 (52.125\u00a0km/h) brought her fifth place. In November 2007 she trained with the national team of Australia in preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing . \"Track racing in the Netherlands is a small sport and we do not have a coaching team available for 12 months of the year as they do in Australia. If only we did.\" she said. At the 2008 Summer Olympics , she took part in the women's sprint, again finishing in 11th place. At the 2012 Summer Olympics , Hijgenaar and teammate Willy Kanis came 5th in the women's team sprint. 2009 World Championships Hijgenaar won her fourth World Championship medal on 28 March 2009, taking the bronze medal in the Omnium , the first time the competition had been included for women in the World Championships. She was on equal points with Tara Whitten of Canada but missed out on that medal despite winning the 200 m flying start time trial and 500 m time trial events in the omnium. She has now set the London Olympics of 2012 as a possible end to her career. If she fails to win a medal, she predicts she will stop.

{"id": "doc_random_159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mponeng_Gold_Mine", "text": "Mponeng is an ultra-deep tabular gold mine in South Africa in the Witwatersrand Basin of the Gauteng Province . Previously known as Western Deep Levels No1 Shaft, the mine began operations in 1986. It is one of the most substantial gold mines in the world in terms of both production and magnitude, reaching over 4 kilometres (2.5\u00a0mi) below the surface. At this depth Mponeng takes the title of world's deepest mine from ground level, with aims to deepen the mine beyond 4km to reach more reserves. A trip from the surface to its deepest point takes over an hour. An Ecuadorian marathon runner completed a half marathon within the mine in 2017. The mine supports a very large number of people, companies and industries, including entire towns and cities. Operations History As part of the Witwatersrand, the largest gold mineralization on earth, Mponeng is the result of the discovery of the basin by Europeans. Beginning in the 1850-70s a series of mineral discoveries were made in the area, including those of Pieter Jacobus Marais panning gold from a river and Henry Lewis finding a quartz and gold vein on a farm, that led to the Witwatersrand Gold Rush in 1886. These discoveries led to many mining operations and after shaft sinking for about 5 years (1981) Mponeng officially began mining operations in 1986. Before Mponeng, the mine was known as the Western Deep Levels South Shaft or the No1 Shaft; the name Mponeng came into use in 1999. Liv Shange addresses striking mineworkers in Carletonville during 2012 national strikes. The mine is estimated to be producing until 2029, when reserves may finally run out, the mine has been running since 1986 and has the possibility to run for 43 years. Current depths reach roughly 3.8\u00a0km down, in the coming years of remaining production life of the mine it will likely reach beyond 4.2\u00a0km depth. The mine has not been running continuously since the day of opening in 1986. A seismic event in March 2020 killed three miners, causing a stoppage of operations. Like many other operations, Mponeng closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020, but has since returned to production. Striking in South Africa's mining district was apparent in the 1900s, for example the South African gold mine strike in August 1946. As Mponeng did not start operations until near the turn of the century there has not been many other notable strikes since then, other than 2012. In 2012, while AngloGold Ashanti was Mponeng's owner, strikes occurred. The strikes were a combined result of gold and platinum industry-worker issues in South Africa. AngloGold's position on the matter was to maintain safety, peace, and stability. The striking action of 2012 totaled nearly 16% of the total mining workforce of South Africa, not just Mponeng. AngloGold specifically experienced nearly 35,000 workers putting down their tools in the illegal strike. Although not at Mponeng, the strike of 2012 included a wildcat strike at a nearby platinum mine ended with 34 miners dying from police interactions. Operations and ownership Harmony Gold , Africa's largest gold producer, purchased Mponeng from AngloGold Ashanti (AGA) in 2020, for approximately $200\u00a0million. Harmony Gold also acquired Mine Waste Solutions as they gathered the remainder of AGA's assets in late 2020. As of 2022, all-in costs of production were US$1771/oz (US$1614/Troy oz). Even at near record high gold prices, Mponeng is barely breaking even. Gold is currently worth roughly US$2080/oz (US$1900/Troy oz). Over 5,400 metric tons of rock are excavated from Mponeng each day. Harmony Gold, aside from closures, has kept up operations: The most recent publication from Harmony Gold outlines their 2023 year production: Produced: 7,449\u00a0kg (239,490 oz) of gold Grade: 8.43g/t Volume of ore milled: 884,000 tons Physical conditions A colony of Desulforudis audaxviator , discovered in the Mponeng gold mine The temperature of the rock reaches 66\u00a0\u00b0C (151\u00a0\u00b0F), and the mine pumps slurry ice underground to cool the tunnel air to below 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F). A mixture of concrete, water, and rock is packed into excavated areas, which further acts as an insulator. Tunnel walls are secured by flexible shotcrete reinforced with steel fibers, which is further held in place by diamond-mesh netting. In 2008, researchers looking for extremophile organisms discovered the bacterium Desulforudis audaxviator present within groundwater samples from kilometers deep in the mine. The name 'Audaxviator' comes from a Latin-language passage in the novel Journey to the Centre of the Earth by Jules Verne : \"Descende, audax viator, et terrestre centrum attinges.\" (\"Descend, bold traveller, and attain the centre of the Earth.\") Geology and gold bearing fractures The mine sits in the Witwatersrand Basin and uses 2 horizons: Ventersdorp Contact Reef and Carbon Leader Reef. In the Mponeng mine the Ventersdorp Contact Reef is mainly interbedded quartzite and coarse conglomerates and constitutes only a meter or two of thickness. The Witwatersrand Basin has experienced many surges of thrusting in the past, resulting in abundant fractures. These small faults often correspond to depositional and sediment contacts. It is along these faults that mineralizing fluids flow, which lead to the precipitation or mineralisation of gold. This complicated geologic history associates with gold mineralization to a high degree, the Witwatersrand Basin holds nearly a third of gold reserves and is responsible for over 40% of all gold. Mponeng has a proven gold reserve of roughly 46 million ounces (over 1300 tons), more than 8x the second deepest gold mine ' Driefontein ', also located in South Africa. The gold mineralization is likely related to hydrothermal activity, and occurs in varying lithology of conglomerates, known as the reefs stated above. The stratigraphy that the gold is found in ranges in thickness, from around 10\u00a0cm to a 1-meter. Gold is found in these variable thickness layers of pebble lags, stacked fluvial deposits, and other stratigraphy. Mponeng specifically, gold is associated with previously mentioned thrust fracturing and with the following mineralisations: Steep quartz/sulphide-bearing fractures Sub-horizontal quartz fractures Sulphide-bearing fractures Ultracataclastics Mesophased hydrocarbons As with most mines, Mponeng is limited to the structural control of the geology. The VCR mineralisation is governed by thrust-fracture systems discussed above, largely from the Lower Kliprivierberg age. The VCR and CLR themselves are around 2.7 billion years old, and have experienced lots of deformation and change. Environmental impacts South Africa has been dealing with the effects of mining-related pollution for years; the effects of mining-related environmental damage have been large given that mining is roughly 8% of the South African GDP. In 1998, mining industry contributed nearly 90% of the 533.6\u00a0million tons of waste that was produced annually. According to 1998 data, gold mining is the largest single source of pollution in South Africa. A large portion of this occurs in the Witwatersrand Basin, home to over 270 tailings storage facilities, covering 18,000 Ha. Mining creates two main kinds of waste: waste rock piles and tailing storage facilities (TSFs). Waste rock piles are the rock that must be removed in order to reach the ore; for Mponeng, the waste rock piles are considerable due to the mine's great depth. Tailings result from the crushing and grinding process of the ore , very fine silt sized material is produced and collected in mounds. Tailings especially come with severe environmental and health issues as they contain potentially hazardous chemicals. Long-term consequences are also of concern, whether the mine activities continue, halt, or a mine is abandoned, these TSFs can pose serious risk the surrounding environment. Pollution has been found to persist even after 72 years of mine abandonment. The mine also emitted 933,205 tons of CO 2 equivalent in 2024. Gold mining operations contribute to greenhouse gas emissions primarily through the use of heavy machinery, ore processing, and energy-intensive refining methods. Diesel-powered equipment, explosives, and electricity consumption\u2014largely derived from fossil fuels in South Africa\u2014lead to significant carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) emissions. Beyond the environment, the citizens of the Witwatersrand Basin have been complaining of windblown dust, most of which originates from partially rehabilitated TSFs. Anglo Ashanti began recording meteorological data in 2012 and Harmony Gold has since taken over monitoring after the acquisition in 2020. Citizens are concerned surrounding heavy metal content as well as silica content, as both pose serious health risks ( silicosis , tuberculosis , bronchitis , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer). A study in 2020 found elevated value of silica and uranium in PM10 airborne pollution from TSFs of gold mines in the area. In South Africa, heavy metal pollution from mining industry is the leading cause of soil and water pollution. The pollution stems from a few sources: Acid mine drainage (AMD) Salinization Elevated levels of potentially toxic elements (PTE) Mainly heavy metals, also including arsenic ( metalloid ). Airborne dust Environmental remediation Two actions can begin to combat South Africa's pollution issues relating to gold mining, prevention of new pollution and remediation of old. The caveats of prevention and remediation are the fact that both of which are extremely difficult and expensive, neither the mining industry or South Africa could afford a completely turn around on pollution. Immobilizing the PTEs in the TSFs is a main focus of pollution prevention and control. Liming the acidic tailings to a suitable pH (>5.5) can significantly reduce the mobility of cationic PTEs. This requires large amount of lime. Application of clays or organic matter with high cation capacity, with goal of PTE absorption. Application of sesquioxides (M 2 O 3 ) which would immobilize oxy-anionic PTEs. Application of hydroxides or phosphates , similar effect of liming. Other than prevention and remediation, it has been proposed that to protect environments remaining tailings materials should be removed from TSFs if containment is not secure. Seismicity Seismicity in mines is common as removing mass amounts of rock can change stress dynamics, especially if pre-existing faults exist. This seismicity is termed 'mining-induced seismicity', caused by the release of elastic strain but are often low moment magnitude. Reaching beyond 1,000 events a day, events of any size pose serious risk to mining operations and employees. It is not uncommon for equipment to be damaged, or have the collapse of drifts and stopes as a result of events. On 27 December 2007 a dyke within Mponeng experienced a 1.9 magnitude event caused by stress change due to excavation within the mine. In March 2020 Mponeng experienced a magnitude 2 earthquake in which 3 people were killed. In deep mines, vertical stress can reach 80\u2013100 MPa, equivalent to roughly 10\u00a0km under water. Seismicity in deep gold mines is common, and is often induced by mining activities. Two events can be considered: Type A - low moment magnitude (<1), clustered in time and space, within 100m of mining surface. Induced by blasting, perturbation of excavating processes, closure of stopes. Type B - possible higher moment magnitude (>3), not clustered in time or space. associated with friction dominated existing shear, tectonic earthquakes. Most earthquakes at depth are mining related (Type A), typically associated with the beginning of a new stope. Research One way to move forward is a better understanding of rock burst and excavation methods. A better understanding can provide better safety protocols. A prominent use of deep mines and their associated, often low magnitude, earthquakes is to connect laboratory scale experiments to real world situations. There is also considerable research trying to understand nucleation of said earthquakes, and whether they work the same as larger earthquakes. In Mponeng, JAGUARS (Japanese-German Acoustic Emissions Research in South Africa) has emplaced a network of accelerometers and piezoelectric acoustic emissions sensors. These sensors can record very small moment magnitude earthquakes, capable of recording events with frequencies from 0.7\u00a0kHz to 200\u00a0kHz (M<0.5). In a one year period, 2007\u20132008, nearly 500,000 events were recorded, most of which with low (sub 25\u00a0kHz) frequencies. The JAGUARS network is placed below the Ventersdorp Contact Reef, there are eight Acoustic emissions sensors, two strainmeters , and one triaxial accelerometer that make up the network.

The four-part miniseries is an Essential Media production, directed by Daina Reid and written by Matt Cameron and Elise McCredie. Plot Sunshine is based in Melbourne's inner\u2013western suburb of Sunshine and its surrounds. The story follows Jacob Garang, a young, aspiring South Sudanese-Australian basketballer who is on the cusp of being picked up by scouts for US college teams. He becomes a chief suspect in a police investigation involving a 15-year-old girl, found seriously injured in one of Melbourne's more affluent suburbs. A second strand in the story concerns Eddie ( LaPaglia ), owner of the sports shop, who is persuaded to take over coaching duties of the Sunshine Kings basketball team from the earnest but ineffectual parson Skelton ( Gyngell ). Under new management the team becomes successful and Eddie becomes accepted by the Sudanese community who are the backbone of team. A serious incident in his racist past comes to light and they feel betrayed, resulting in an irreparable loss of trust. A third strand is the efforts of lawyer Zara Skelton ( Lynskey ), daughter of the parson, to divert the police from treating the Sudanese as suspects, and eventually helps them discover the truth.

{"id": "doc_random_162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wah-wah_(music)", "text": "Not to be confused with Wah-Wah (song) . Wah-wah (or wa-wa ) is an imitative word (or onomatopoeia ) for the sound of altering the resonance of musical notes to extend expressiveness, sounding much like a human voice saying the syllable wah . The wah-wah effect is a spectral glide , a \"modification of the vowel quality of a tone\". Ultimate-Guitar opined that the effect is \"one of the most original and easily identified guitar effects in the world.\" Etymology The word is derived from the sound of the effect itself; an imitative or onomatopoeia word. The effect's \"wa-wa\" sound was noted by jazz player Barney Bigard when he heard Tricky Sam Nanton use the effect on his trombone in the early 1920s. History Acoustic The wah-wah effect is believed to have originated in the 1920s, with brass instrument players finding they could produce an expressive crying tone by moving a mute, or plunger, in and out of the instrument's bell. In 1921, trumpet player Johnny Dunn 's use of this style inspired Tricky Sam Nanton to use the mute with the trombone. Electronic Main article: Wah-wah pedal By the early 1960s, the sound of the acoustic technique had been emulated with electronic circuitry. For electric guitar the wah-wah pedal was invented. Technique The method of production varies from one type of instrument to another. On brass instruments, it is usually created by means of a mute , particularly with the harmon (also called a \"wa-wa\" mute) or plunger mute. Woodwind instruments may use \" false fingerings \" to produce the effect. Any electrified instrument may use an auxiliary signal-processing device, or pedal. Often it is controlled by movement of the player's foot on a rocking pedal connected to a potentiometer . An alternative to players directly controlling the amount of effect is an ' auto-wah '. These devices, usually make harder hit notes more trembly with a more prominent wah wah effect. Wah-wah effects are often used for soloing or for creating a \"wacka-wacka\" funk rhythm on guitar. Although these electronic means are most often on electric guitar, they are also often used on electric piano . Theory The wah-wah effect is produced by periodically bringing in and out of play treble frequencies while a note is sustained. Therefore, the effect is a type of spectral glide , a \"modification of the vowel quality of a tone\". The Electronic wah-wah effects are produced by controlling tone filters with a pedal . An envelope follower circuit is used in the ' auto-wah '. Subtractive synthesis can produce a similar effect. Notable uses Tricky Sam Nanton's wah-wah on trombone in Duke Ellington 's Orchestra became well known as part of the so-called \"jungle\" effects of the band in the late 1920s. This technique has been used in contemporary music. Karlheinz Stockhausen notates the use of the wah-wah mute in his Punkte (1952/1962) in terms of transitions between open to close using open and closed circles connected by a line. Although the most common method of producing wah-wah on brass instruments is with a mute, some players have used electronic filtering, notably Miles Davis on trumpet.

History A building referred to as a castle was mentioned in 1328, and acted as the headquarters of the Teutonic Order from 1619; though by 1774 it was derelict, and demolished, being replaced by the present Baroque palace, and the English garden laid out. It was extended in 1885 with two more wings. In 1974, it was sold to the city of Leverkusen and subsequently renovated in order to permanently function as the city's museum of modern art from 1985. The museum was the first one in North Rhine-Westphalia explicitly exhibiting works by famous international post-war painters, sculptors and installation artists. It presented artists such as Yves Klein , Lucio Fontana , Louise Nevelson , Andy Warhol , Burhan Dogancay and Robert Motherwell . During the last 50 years, it collected 400 paintings and sculptures and 5000 prints by contemporary artists. In 2009, the museum was named \"museum of the year\" by the German section of the International Association of Art Critics . A report by KPMG published in February 2016 suggested closing the museum to reduce costs. References ^ a b Braun, Detlef (2012). Leverkusen . Erfurt: Sutton. p.\u00a042-3.

{"id": "doc_random_164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Hofmeyer", "text": "Hans Hofmeyer (12 April 1904 \u2013 28 August 1992) was a German jurist. He was in charge of the first Auschwitz trial in Frankfurt am Main . Life During the first Auschwitz trial at Frankfurt, Hofmeyer lived in Bad Vilbel . During the trial, he declined even the most innocuous interview, stating that he did not want to disturb the course of the trial. Academic studies and career Hofmeyer studied law at Frankfurt am Main , Munich and Gie\u00dfen . After the trainee lawyers' exam in 1928 and the second state examination in 1931, he worked as an assessor until 1936, first in a lawyers' office in Darmstadt , later at courts in Worms , Darmstadt and Offenbach . In 1936, he became a councillor at a municipal court. During the Second World War , he worked as an intelligence officer until he was named senior staff judge in the National Socialist military jurisdiction in 1944. Starting in 1946, he was the chairman of the criminal division at the District Court of Frankfurt am Main. In 1954, he became the chairman of the civil division of the District Court, where he was in charge of press relations. At the beginning of the 1960s, he returned to the criminal division as a regional court director. During the first Auschwitz trial, he was named president of the senate at the Higher Regional Court at Frankfurt am Main. In Frankfurt, he led some supra-regional trials, among them the lawsuits concerning the book \"Der rote Rufmord\" (Red Calumny) by Kurt Ziesel and the lawsuits of the former prime minister of Schleswig-Holstein, Kai-Uwe von Hassel , against the newspaper \" Frankfurter Rundschau \". He gained an international reputation as a judge at the first Frankfurt Auschwitz trial. First Frankfurt Auschwitz trial (1963 \u2013 1965) Hofmeyer, as Chief Judge, led the action \"criminal case against Mulka and others\" (reference number 4 Ks 2/63) which is also known as first Auschwitz trial . The trial was held from December 20, 1963, to August 20, 1965, before the District Court at Frankfurt am Main. Originally, 22 defendants were tried during 183 days before court. The trial became known as the \"most important West German lawsuit against National Socialist violent criminals\". Primarily, Hans Forester was scheduled to be Chief Judge and Hofmeyer to be his assessor. However, Forester had relatives that had been persecuted in National Socialist Germany. Since conflicts due to probable bias were feared, Forester was excused from the trial in the fall of 1963, and Hans Hofmeyer was made chairman. Hofmeyer's nomination as Chief Judge was a surprise, for in his career until then there were few indications that he might be able to conduct a trial of this dimension, which would, furthermore, be observed internationally. Moreover, he had been a judge himself in National Socialist Germany. But even ideological opponents such as the defence counsel Friedrich Karl Kaul did not find any indications in this to jeopardize the trial. Hofmeyer wanted to prevent the marathon trial the Hessian Attorney General Fritz Bauer had initiated. From his point of view, such fundamental trials were not feasible and marred the rights of the defendants. Rather, he favoured that they should be divided into several small trials specific for the single accused. Even after the successful end of the trial, he argued resolutely against the conducting of such trials. However, he could not make his point against Fritz Bauer . For Bauer , juridical coming to terms with the whole set of facts in the Auschwitz case was the focus. He wanted to investigate as many suspects as possible to elucidate the entirety of offenses in the camp in one or several large trials. With the investigation of the set of crimes, the German public was to be confronted with the National Socialist misdeeds. These differing concepts were voiced again during the reasons for the judgment. At the beginning of the promulgation, Hofmeyer explained: \"We are dealing here with a normal criminal trial, may it have such or such a background. The court could only pronounce judgement according to the laws it has evoked. And these laws require, in subjective and objective terms, an exact ascertainment of the precise guilt of an accused\". Moreover, the trial was not an Auschwitz trial but a \"trial against Mulka and others.\" The witnesses' testimonies had deeply impressed Hofmeyer. He concluded the reasons for the judgment, visibly moved, with the words: \"There may be certainly some among us who cannot look into the joyful and happy eyes of a child for a long time without thinking of the fear-filled, enquiring and believing eyes of those children that went their way in Auschwitz.\" Appraisal Both by the participants at the Auschwitz trial and by the press, Hofmeyer was described as a brilliant jurist and experienced chief negotiator who was a match for all phases of the trial. The lawyer Henry Ormond pointed out the \"exemplary conduct of the trial\". According to Eugen Kogon , it was the merit of the jury court to resist all snares due to its \"superior juridical self-restriction\". Herrmann Langbein , prisoner at Auschwitz, witness and observer during the trial, attested the judge: \"He conducted the trial expertly and managed to quickly override petty bantering and political propaganda.\" The newspaper Die Welt wrote about him: \"The chairman in the Auschwitz trial is a down-to-earth man who does not care about intellectual amusements, juridical fireworks. If common sense exists at all, he has it. Often, he asks one or two more questions than somebody else would ask because he cannot believe which is, in fact, unbelievable.\" The newspaper Sonntagsblatt wrote about Hofmeyer: \"This judge, as poorly gifted with rhetorical eloquence as most of his fellows, found the words that displayed him and the court he had led for twenty months, at the end of the trial, once again as representatives of a justice whose image would only be inadequately explained with the symbol of the Blind Goddess.\" Bibliography Raphael Gross / Werner Renz (Hrsg.), Der Frankfurter Auschwitz-Prozess (1963\u20131965).

{"id": "doc_random_166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesundheit_Radio", "text": "The Gesundheit Radio is a 2010 artwork by James Chambers consisting of a transistor radio which periodically \"sneezes\" dust from its speaker grille . It was part of a series of \"Artificial Defence Mechanisms\" works imagining how electronic objects might display animal behaviors. Chambers suggest that this feature is at odds with the built-in obsolescence of many modern gadgets. The radio was exhibited at the Royal College of Art while Chambers was studying there, and at MOMA in 2011. The exclamation \"Gesundheit!\" (meaning \"Health!\") is the German response to someone who has sneezed . The ficional back-story of the piece, that it had been designed in the 1970s by Texas Instruments to reduce dust build-up, was reported in the press without clear indication that this story was fictional and the work was an art exhibit. Fictional backstory According to Chambers' fictional backstory for the device, it was supposedly created by an experimental research group at Texas Instruments in 1972. It had been engineered to sneeze routinely once every six months, blowing out dust and shaking its case, supposedly to protect its early microprocessors from dust and ensure a longer life for the device. Chambers attributed the design to the \"Attenborough Design Group\", supposed to have been active in the 1970s and 1980s, and an experimental section within Texas Instruments, where it was their first product. Other whimsical artworks with technological inspiration supposed to have been created by the group included the AntiTouch Lamp which avoided human touch, allegedly to protect its halogen lamp. In the fictional history, the experimental research group within Texas Instruments was said to have examined how behaviors in nature could be applied to design; in this case, the ability to sneeze. It was said to be investigating the potential of other animal actions to be used as defense for a 'family' of between 3 and 5 products, and re-interpreting the standing hard drive (an earlier artwork) as a portable floppy disk drive so as to fit in with the Attenborough Design Group's fictional timeline. The whimsical device's legs popped up when coffee was spilt on the table under it, keeping it out of harm's way. Reception Chris Davies, writing on SlashGear , commented that personal computers would benefit from a feature like the Gesundheit Radio's bellows to keep them free of dust, given by how much of it they habitually collect. Jaymi Heimbuch, writing on TreeHugger , wrote that keeping dust out of gadgets prolonged their lives, and that while engineering an iPad to sneeze like the Gesundheit Radio might not be a good idea, cleaning electronics devices certainly is.

Reign He ruled during a time in Shirvanshah history that scholarship has referred to \"a period of total confusion\", due to the lack of written records and contradictory numismatic evidence. He was a son of Shirvanshah Manuchihr III ( r. \u20091120\u00a0\u2013\u00a0after 1160 ). He had had three brothers, Akhsitan I , Afridun II , and Shahanshah . An inscription from 1203 or 1204 mentions Farrukhzad I as the Shirvanshah. This means that Akhsitan I's reign ended between 1197 and 1203 or 1204. Recent evidence suggests that Farrukhzad I did not rule beyond 1225. An inscription from a tower in Mardakan mentions both Farrukhzad I and his son Garshasp I , crediting the latter with the construction of the tower. The Armenian-American historian Dickran Kouymjian suggests that they may have ruled in different parts of the kingdom, with Farrukhzad I most likely ruling in Baku , which is close to Mardakan. Family According to The Georgian Chronicles , around 1223 an unnamed Shirvanshah asked for the hand of the Georgian princess Rusudan , the sister of the king of Georgia , George IV ( r. \u20091213\u20131223 ). The proposal was accepted, but was soon cancelled due to George IV's death, which occurred while he was en route to the ceremony. The unnamed Shirvanshah may have been Farrukhzad I, Garshasp I or Fariburz III . He had at least two sons: Garshasp (1204 \u2013 1225) Rashid (1221 \u2013 1239) References ^ a b Kouymjian 1969 , p.\u00a0194. ^ Kouymjian 1969 , p.\u00a0183. ^ Kouymjian 1969 , p.\u00a0242. ^ a b Kouymjian 1969 , p.\u00a0182. ^ Kouymjian 1969 , p.\u00a0195. ^ Kouymjian 1969 , pp.\u00a0195\u2013196. ^ Kouymjian 1969 , p.\u00a0218.

Incident The attacker shot 105 bullets, and severely wounded policeman Mirsad Veli\u0107. A sniper neutralized the gunman. Perpetrator The attacker was identified as Mevlid Ja\u0161arevi\u0107 (b. 1988), a Bosniak holding Serbian citizenship born in Novi Pazar in southwestern Serbia, and living in well-known Wahhabist stronghold Gornja Mao\u010da in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ja\u0161arevi\u0107 lived in Vienna for a period before moving to Gornja Mao\u010da. Aftermath On 24 April 2012, Ja\u0161arevi\u0107 was indicted by a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia on charges of attempted murder and other violations in connection with the attack. A Bosnian court sentenced him on 6 December 2012 to 18 years in prison. It was then lowered to 15 years in 2013. On 23 November 2018, Bosnian police arrested a man believed to have assisted Ja\u0161arevi\u0107 in the attack. Bosnian state prosecutors stated that the man was also suspected of having fought for the Islamic State and Al-Nusra Front .

{"id": "doc_random_174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ_rights_in_the_United_States_Virgin_Islands", "text": "Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) rights in the U.S. Virgin Islands have evolved substantially in recent years. Same-sex sexual activity has been legal since 1985. The region also provides explicit legal protections against discrimination for LGBTQ residents since December 2022. Following the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges on June 26, 2015, which found the denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples unconstitutional, same-sex marriage became legal in the islands. Laws regarding same-sex sexual activity The first anti-gay criminal law was imposed by Denmark . All Danish laws remained in force following the purchase of the islands by the United States in 1917 until specifically changed. In 1921, a new law was passed, establishing a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment for sodomy. A separate law prohibited an assault \"with intent to commit ... sodomy\" with a penalty of up to 15 years' imprisonment. In 1957, the law's application was extended to include oral sex , whether heterosexual or homosexual. In 1978, the law was challenged in Government v. John as being too vague, but the District Court of the Virgin Islands rejected this argument. In 1984, the Legislature of the Virgin Islands repealed its sodomy law. This revision formally took effect a year later. Same-sex sexual activity has been legal in the U.S. Virgin Islands since 1985, as long as it occurs between consenting adults in private. Initially, the age of consent was set at 16, but this was raised to 18 in 2017. Recognition of same-sex relationships Main article: Same-sex marriage in the United States Virgin Islands The statutes of the Virgin Islands state that \"Marriage is hereby declared to be a civil contract which may be entered into between a male and a female in accordance with the law.\" However, on June 30, 2015, Governor Kenneth Mapp announced that the islands would comply with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges , recognizing marriage as a fundamental right that cannot be denied to same-sex couples. History In May 2014, Senator Judi Buckley introduced draft legislation in the Legislature of the Virgin Islands to establish same-sex marriage. Called the Civil Marriage Equality Act , it would have replaced the Code's \"between a male and a female\" with \"between two persons\". It included language that would have allowed anyone authorized to perform a wedding ceremony to decline to do so for any reason. She anticipated that it would take several months for its language to be reviewed. She expected that she and Governor John de Jongh , who she said would sign the legislation, would leave office in January 2015 before the legislation came to a vote. Supporters of the legislation include Liberty Place, an LGBT advocacy organization based on St. Croix. In response, a group of church leaders organized One Voice Virgin Islands to oppose the legislation and plan a petition drive that aimed to collect 50,000 signatures. The group authored a letter to V.I. officials that some of its members found objectionable because it included the suggestion that some government officials were homosexual. The group's president, New Vision Ministries Pastor James Petty of St. Thomas, said: \"We do not wish to be America's same-sex paradise\". Pastor Lennox Zamore said that he rejected the argument that legalizing same-sex marriage would benefit the local economy: \"We don't want to balance our books by bringing the sex industry \u2013 whether it is same sex or not \u2013 to the Virgin Islands\". Senator Buckley expressed \"disappointment\" in the churches, stating that they invoke the Bible only when same-sex marriage is the topic, but not for murder, rape or abuse. Eventually, the bill did not advance before Buckley left office in January 2015. Adoption and parenting Following Obergefell v. Hodges , same-sex couples are permitted to adopt in the Virgin Islands. Additionally, lesbian couples may access in vitro fertilisation and other assisted reproduction services. State law recognizes the non-gestational, non-genetic parent as a legal parent of a child born via donor insemination, but only if the parents are in a legally recognized relationship (e.g. marriage). Discrimination protections In September 2022, a bill was introduced to explicitly include \"sexual orientation and gender identity\" to the US Virgin Islands Code (regarding discrimination protections). There has also been a debate when introduced as to it is actually needed - because under federal law that discrimination based on sex, automatically includes sexual orientation during a 2020 SCOTUS ruling. The bill passed the committee and floor stages and went to the Governor's desk. Then in December 2022, the Governor formally signed a bill into law (effective immediately) that passed recently to explicitly include both sexual orientation and gender identity - to legally protect individuals against discrimination on the US Virgin Islands. The US Virgin Islands law addresses discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations on account of sexual orientation or gender identity. The Virgin Islands Civil Rights Act prohibits such discrimination based on \"race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, or disability\". Discrimination on account of sexual orientation is prohibited by Master Service Providers , who must \"provide consistent and equal telecommunication services to all licensees and shall not discriminate\" based on a variety of reasons. In addition, the Department of Health has a personnel non-discrimination policy, forbidding discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Hate crime law The Hate-Motivated Crimes Act , passed in 2014, provides for enhanced penalties for crimes committed based on the victim's \"race, color, religion, national origin, sex, ancestry, age, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity\". Bullying and discrimination in schools Virgin Islands law requires each school district to \"make suitable provisions for instruction in bullying prevention and gang resistance training\". \"Bullying prevention\" is defined as \"prevention and strategies for student-centered problem solving all of the following: (1) Intimidation; (2) Student victimization; (3) Sexual harassment; (4) Sexual violence; (5) Sexual, discrimination due to sexual orientation; and (6) Harassment.\" In March 2017, Attorney General Claude Walker interpreted the term \"sex\" as used in the Civil Rights Act to cover transgender students. As the term is not defined in Virgin Islands law, Walker instead chose to follow case law, particularly Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins and Glenn v. Brumby . Walker said: Given the courts and agency decisions \u2026 it appears clear that the term \"sex,\" as used in \u2026 Virgin Islands Code, also should be interpreted to mean that in the U.S. Virgin Islands, discrimination against a transgender individual based on that person's transgender status is sex discrimination under the Virgin Islands Civil Rights statute. Walker instructed the Department of Education to permit transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms matching their gender identity. Gender identity and expression There exists no statutory ban on changing the gender marker on birth certificates, though no legal regulations are known to exist to do so. The National Center for Transgender Equality reports that \"multiple representatives of the Superior Court of USVI stated that they are unaware of a single instance of a petition being received for changing a gender marker. The court representatives were unable to speculate on the outcome of a petition for changing a gender marker.\" Transgender individuals are permitted to change their name to reflect their gender identity on official documents, including driver's licenses and birth certificates. Living conditions The U.S. Virgin Islands, and particularly St. Thomas , had a large LGBT scene from the mid 1960s to the 1980s, even been referred in the media as a \"gay mecca\". Numerous clubs and bar would openly cater to LGBT clientele. However, with Hurricane Hugo and Hurricane Marilyn , which had massive economic impacts on the islands, as well as the AIDS pandemic, many of these businesses closed. Today, \"homosexuality is a very hush hush thing in the Virgin Islands \u2026 to identify as openly gay, lesbian, or transgender [is] extremely taboo\". While LGBT people may be out to varying degrees, many report occasional or common harassment or abuse, though often non-violent. Famous LGBT people from the Virgin Islands include professional boxer Emile Griffith .

{"id": "doc_random_175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartwick_Hawks_men%27s_soccer", "text": "The Hartwick Hawks men's soccer team represents Hartwick College as member of the Empire 8 in NCAA Division III . The Hawks play their home matches on Elmore Field located on the Hartwick campus in Oneonta, New York . The team is coached by John Scott, the seventh head coach in the program's long history. The Hawks were distinguished by being the only Division III program playing Division I men's soccer as an affiliate member of the Sun Belt Conference and by having won the 1977 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship . However, on February 28, 2018, Hartwick announced that the men's soccer program would be moving from D1 to D3. History Hartwick men's soccer was started by Hal Greig in 1956, three years before the NCAA began sanctioning the sport. Building slowly, Greig headed the program for four years, leading the Hawks to their first two winning seasons. Greig was succeeded by David Haase, who in seven seasons had five winning teams, two more with .500 records, and led the Hawks to their first two NCAA Men's Soccer Championship tournaments in 1962 and 1964. Al Miller headed the program for six seasons, leading the Hawks to five NCAA Tournaments, including their first College Cup placing third in 1970. Miller was coach when, in 1972, the NCAA Division II Men's Soccer Championship was begun. Hartwick, along with many other \"non-major\" schools, moved into the new division. Following that season, Miller was hired away into the ranks of professional soccer. After only one season in DII, Hartwick and several other of the more prominent DII soccer programs moved back to Division I. Timo Liekoski headed the program for three seasons, gaining three NCAA tournaments, and a second third-place finish in 1974 before he, too, was hired away to the pros. Liekoski was succeeded by Jim Lennox, who remained at the Hartwick helm for twenty-seven seasons. Under Lennox, the Hawks advanced to thirteen NCAA tournaments, five College Cups, and the 1977 NCAA Championship. By the time Lennox departed Hartwick for the NSCAA, several of the \"major\" athletic conferences had come to emphasize soccer, and the non-major soccer independents like Hartwick were largely overtaken by big-budget major schools. While Lennox's teams made the NCAA tournament in eleven of his first twelve seasons, they made only three of his last fifteen, including missing during each of his last seven seasons at Hartwick. In 2000, Hartwick left the ranks of the independent schools, joining the Atlantic Soccer Conference (ASC). In 2002, Lennox quit the Hartwick post unexpectedly to become Director of Coaching Education for the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA). For his work at Hartwick and the NSCAA, he was named to the NSCAA Hall of Fame in 2013. Ian McIntyre followed Lennox. His Hawks had five winning seasons in seven years. They won the ASC regular season and tournament titles in 2005, putting Hartwick in the NCAA tournament for the first time in ten years. In 2007, Hartwick became an affiliate member of the Mid-American Conference (MAC). Hartwick has been coached by John Scott since 2010. In 2013, the MAC eliminated affiliate members, and Hartwick became an affiliate of the Sun Belt Conference , which added men's soccer in 2014 for the first time since 1995. In the first season in the Sun Belt, while having an overall record of only 6\u201310\u20134, the Hawks went 3-1-1 in conference competition to win the regular season championship, then won the conference tournament to advance to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2005. Building on that success, the 2015 Hawks were 11\u20136\u20133, repeating as conference champions at 5\u20130\u20130, winning their second conference tournament, and earning successive NCAA tournament spots for the first time since 1986\u201387. Hartwick was playing Division I men's soccer and awarding athletic scholarships to soccer players before the NCAA initiated the non-scholarship Division III in 1974\u201375. Several other schools that moved into Division III also were awarding scholarships in ice hockey, lacrosse, or volleyball. These schools (originally nine, now eight) were \"grandfathered\" into Division I in their one sport as long as they had sport from the other gender (usually a women's program) also in D1 to meet Title IX requirements (Hartwick chose to start a D1 women's polo program, but eliminated the program when it moved the men's soccer program back to D3 in February 2018).

{"id": "doc_random_176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Ligon", "text": "Thomas Ligon (born September 10, 1940) is an American actor of Cajun ancestry. He appeared in the films Paint Your Wagon , Jump , and Bang the Drum Slowly (in which he also sang the title song) as well as the television series The Young and the Restless , and Oz . Life and career Mentored by folksinger and actor Gordon Heath in Paris, beginning in the mid 1950s, Ligon then attended St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.) , where he suffered a broken leg while playing football, and, sans sports, his interests turned solidly toward theater. At Yale , where he was a member of Skull and Bones and graduated as an English major (1962), he was discovered by Tennessee Williams , who saw his performance as Kilroy in Williams' play, Camino Real at the Yale Dramatic Association . Ligon became one of the most sought after young actors in New York in the 1960s. Ligon has appeared on many prominent regional stages in the U.S., notably the Arena Stage where he played the title role in Billy Budd and in Hard Travelin' by Millard Lampell in 1964, and Actors Theatre of Louisville , where he played Hank Czerniak, the polka king, in Evelyn and the Polka King . Tom Ligon and Katharine Dunfee Clarke (K.C. Ligon - 1948-2009) were married on New Year's Eve in 1976. Tom Ligon created the role of Orson in the prize-winning Off-Broadway musical Your Own Thing (1968), and starred on Broadway opposite Geraldine Page in Angela , by Sumner Arthur Long, and with Sandy Duncan in John Patrick's Love is a Time of Day . This work on stage led to appearing in two films, Paint Your Wagon and Bang the Drum Slowly . Concerning Ligon's third film, Jump (1971): Quentin Tarantino called it \"this amazing film that no one\u2019s ever seen \u2013 I\u2019ve only seen it once and I\u2019d love to see it again \u2013 this really good Seventies backtrack exploitation movie... It\u2019s hilarious and very satirical. I remember really liking that.\" Ligon played the Tiger in Rajiv Joseph 's Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo in its original iteration, directed by Giovanna Sardelli at the Lark Play Development Center in New York City. Other noteworthy appearances on the New York stage include Geniuses , BAFO (Best and Final Offer) , Den of Thieves , The Golf Ball , Tartuffe: Born Again , A Backer's Audition , Another Paradise , and Have I Got A Girl for You . In 2000, Ligon appeared in a critically acclaimed New York production of Our Town , directed by Jack Cummings III, where he played George Gibbs. Also, for Transport Group , he subsequently played in Requiem For William , All the Way Home , and The Audience , all directed by Jack Cummings III. In August 2013, when Ligon was age 72, The New York Times reported that he sent an intruder tumbling to the pavement below with a fist to the forehead and a ninja shout after the man had entered his Greenwich Village apartment through a window. Responding to later news that it was a \"career burglar\" he had chased away, and who was now in jail, Ligon told The Times : \"Well, I guess he's not having much of a 'career' right now. It's like acting \u2013 you\u2019ve got your ups and downs.\" Ligon served many years as SAG-AFTRA 's Chair, National Seniors Committee. He has also served as a member of the Board of Directors, New York Screen Actors Guild (2005\u201307).

{"id": "doc_random_177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_pad", "text": "A tent pad A tent pad is a designated area at a campground site to a set up a tent. It eliminates the need to find a suitable spot to pitch a tent. Often, a tent pad is a single row of timbers forming a square that retains the fill, resembling a sandbox . In addition to wood, it can also be framed with cement or other material. The framing allows the tent pad to be even and level on rough or sloping terrain and allows for more comfortable sleeping. Some tent pads do not have framing, but instead are raised area of dirt that are sometimes topped with wood chips . An open grassy area does not constitute a tent pad. Furthermore, a tent pad is often elevated about 4 to 6 inches. This elevation also prevents standing water from developing and reduces the risk of flooding when it rains since it has better drainage. The tent pad also makes it easier to stake a tent since there are no large rocks or tree roots in the fill. The fill can be composed of sandy soil, dirt, gravel , sand and gravel mix, mulch , cement, or river rock. Tent pads can come in a variety of sizes depending on the type of camping (e.g. backpacking , leisure camping) or region of the country. There are no standard dimensions, but commons sizes include 8 feet x 8 feet, 10 feet x 10 feet, 12 feet x 12 feet, and 15 feet x 15 feet. Some are oversized, greater than 15 square feet, designed to accommodate a large family tent. A campsite may have a designated tent pad, but otherwise a flat, durable surface like dirt or gravel would be a suitable alternative. Having a designated tent pad can help prevent damage to the vegetation of the area from staking or setting up the tents in other areas of the campsite. Tent pads are most often found at developed campgrounds but can also be found in primitive and even wilderness campsites. Tent pads need to be maintained, otherwise erosion can occur and cause slopes and/or water channels to form. References ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n \"Tent Pads And Tent Camping - Campetent\" .

{"id": "doc_random_178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothar_Matth%C3%A4us", "text": "Lothar Herbert Matth\u00e4us ( German pronunciation: [\u02c8lo\u02d0ta\u0281 ma\u02c8t\u025b\u02d0\u028as] \u24d8 ; born 21 March 1961) is a German football pundit and former professional player and manager. He captained West Germany to victory in the 1990 FIFA World Cup and was awarded the Ballon d'Or . In 1991, he was named the first FIFA World Player of the Year , and remains the only German to have received the award. He was also included in the Ballon d'Or Dream Team in 2020. Matth\u00e4us was the first outfield player, and second overall after Antonio Carbajal , to appear at five FIFA World Cups ( 1982 , 1986 , 1990 , 1994 and 1998 ); he remains one of only six male players to have done so, along with Antonio Carbajal , Rafael M\u00e1rquez , Lionel Messi , Cristiano Ronaldo , and Andr\u00e9s Guardado . He also won UEFA Euro 1980 , and played in the 1984 , 1988 and 2000 UEFA European Championships . In 1999, aged 38, Matth\u00e4us was again voted German Footballer of the Year , having previously won the award in 1990. Matth\u00e4us is the most capped German player of all time, retiring with a total of 150 appearances (83 for West Germany) in 20 years, and 23 goals. Matth\u00e4us is a member of the FIFA 100 list of the greatest living football players chosen by Pel\u00e9 . Diego Maradona said of Matth\u00e4us, \"He is the best rival I've ever had. I guess that's enough to define him.\" A versatile and complete player, Matth\u00e4us is regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of all time, and was renowned for his perceptive passing, positional sense and well-timed tackling, as well as his powerful shooting. During his career, he usually played as a box-to-box midfielder , although late in his career he played as a sweeper . Early life Lothar Herbert Matth\u00e4us was born on 21 March 1961 in Erlangen , Bavaria , West Germany, to Heinz (1930\u20132019) and Katharina (1931\u20132020) Matth\u00e4us. His father, who was born in southern Silesia , fled west across the Oder during the Soviet invasion in 1944, then worked as a canteen manager, while his mother worked for Puma . He spent his early playing days in the youth team of 1. FC Herzogenaurach , located in a small town in Bavaria close to Nuremberg . Club career Matth\u00e4us started his professional career in 1979 with Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach of the Bundesliga , for whom he played until 1984. He then played for Bayern Munich from 1984 to 1988, winning the Bundesliga twice and the DFB-Pokal . They also reached the European Cup final in 1987 , leading 1\u20130 for most of the game until two late goals gave FC Porto the win. Matth\u00e4us in 1995 Matth\u00e4us and Bayern teammate Andreas Brehme signed with Inter Milan of Serie A in 1988, winning the Scudetto in 1988\u201389 during their first season, and the Italian Supercup that year as well. Matth\u00e4us continued to enjoy further success with Inter, winning the UEFA Cup in 1991 and being named FIFA World Player of the Year . In the final, he scored a penalty in the first leg to help them to their victory over Roma . Returning to Bayern Munich in 1992, he won four Bundesliga titles, two DFB-Pokals, another UEFA Cup and reached a second European Cup final in 1999 . The only major club football honour which eluded Matth\u00e4us, for competitions in which he played, was the UEFA Champions League . Famously, he came within two minutes of picking up a winners' medal in 1999 , only to have his hopes dashed by Manchester United , who scored two last-minute goals in the final, after he was substituted in the 80th minute of play while the team was still leading 1\u20130. When the two teams went to collect their medals Matth\u00e4us removed his runners-up medal immediately after he received it \u2013 it was the second time he had been on the losing side in a final under similar circumstances; in the 1987 final , Bayern had been leading 1\u20130 most of the game until two late goals gave FC Porto the win. After Matth\u00e4us retired, Bayern would win the Champions League in 2000\u201301 and later that year the Intercontinental Cup . His last official match for Bayern took place in Munich on 8 March 2000 and was a Champions League match against Real Madrid , which Bayern won 4\u20131. During the 1999\u20132000 season, Matth\u00e4us moved from Bayern to New York City's MetroStars team of Major League Soccer in the United States. He played in the US from March to October 2000 and retired from professional football afterwards. During his season with the MetroStars, he traveled to St. Tropez when he was supposed to be rehabbing his back. Matth\u00e4us came out of retirement in 2018, at age 57, to play 50 minutes of 1. FC Herzogenaurach 's final league game of the season. The team had already secured the league title, and the appearance allowed Matth\u00e4us to satisfy his ambition retiring with the club where his career started: \"It was always my dream to play my last competitive game here.\" International career Matth\u00e4us (pictured in 1999) has won more international caps than any German with 150 and went to nine major international tournaments, serving as captain of the 1990 World Cup champions. Early international years Matth\u00e4us was first called up in 1980 to the West German squad that won the UEFA Euro 1980 in Italy, making his international debut during the tournament in a 3\u20132 first round win against the Netherlands on 14 June; this was his only appearance in this edition of the competition. He also played two games at the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain; he was brought on as a substitute in group stage games against Chile and the infamous Disgrace of Gij\u00f3n game versus Austria , which West Germany won 1\u20130, allowing both teams to advance from their group. West Germany reached the final , losing to Italy at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium in Madrid 3\u20131. Matth\u00e4us also had a regular place in the national team for the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, scoring the winner in the round of 16 against Morocco . In the final at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City, despite his considerable play-making ability, he was assigned by coach Franz Beckenbauer to mark Argentina 's Diego Maradona . Maradona did not score in the final, but his pass to Jorge Burruchaga with six minutes left in regulation time set up the winning goal for Argentina, and West Germany lost their second consecutive World Cup final , this time 3\u20132. At UEFA Euro 1988 in West Germany, Matth\u00e4us captained the team and scored a penalty against eventual champions Netherlands in the semi-final to give his team a 1\u20130 lead, but Ronald Koeman leveled the score with a penalty, and then Marco van Basten slid in the winning goal in the final minutes. 1990s During the 1994 World Cup, Matth\u00e4us scored a penalty against Borislav Mihaylov in the quarterfinals against Bulgaria at Giants Stadium , New York City. His immediate success in Italy's premier football league, the Serie A, was a precursor to the national team which finally managed to triumph at the 1990 FIFA World Cup held in Italy. Six of West Germany's squad played professionally there; Matth\u00e4us and the West German squad played most of the World Cup games at Inter's home stadium the San Siro . West Germany was the best team of the tournament and one of the few to choose an attacking style of play, contrary to previous German teams' more defensive style. Matth\u00e4us led his squad from midfield and scored four goals, including two in the team's opening group match, a 4\u20131 win against Yugoslavia . He scored the only goal of the quarter-final against Czechoslovakia from a penalty awarded in the 25th minute of the match. West Germany reached its third consecutive final, a rematch against Maradona-led Argentina, and this time Matth\u00e4us and his team emerged victorious 1\u20130 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome thanks to Andreas Brehme converting an 85th minute penalty . Matth\u00e4us later said that playing the World Cup in Italy was \"like playing a World Cup at home\". As team captain, Matth\u00e4us hoisted the last World Cup trophy before German reunification in 1990. Matth\u00e4us did not participate in the UEFA Euro 1992 in Sweden due to an injury, where a reunified Germany made the final but surprisingly lost 2\u20130 to Denmark . At the 1994 FIFA World Cup hosted by the United States, he captained the team but now operated as sweeper. He scored a penalty in Germany's quarter-final match against Bulgaria at Giants Stadium in New York City, which was also his record-tying 21st World Cup match, but the Bulgarians scored twice in three minutes to upset the defending champions. USA '94 was expected to be his last tournament, though he did not officially retire from international play. Matth\u00e4us was afterwards not called up for the national team, due to feuding with succeeding captain J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann and coach Berti Vogts . In his absence Germany won UEFA Euro 1996 which was held in England. Surprisingly, he was called up for the 1998 World Cup in France as a replacement for the injured Matthias Sammer . He was on the bench for Germany's victory over the United States , but came in as a substitute against FR Yugoslavia and helped the team to a 2\u20132 draw. He became the second player to appear in five different World Cup tournaments, tying the record of Mexican goalkeeper Antonio Carbajal . In 2014 , the record has also been tied by Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon , who however has only played in four. In 2015, Homare Sawa and Formiga became the first footballers to appear for a record sixth time at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada. Matth\u00e4us played in all the rest of Germany's matches until Croatia knocked them out in Lyon 3\u20130 in the quarterfinals, taking his total to a then-record 25 (since eclipsed by Lionel Messi ). Final international year Matth\u00e4us earned his last three caps at UEFA Euro 2000 in Belgium and the Netherlands, with his 150th cap being against Portugal , where Germany had a disastrous first-round exit. He had a poor performance in the first group game against Romania, causing Oliver Bierhoff and other key German players to demand his benching, but head coach Erich Ribbeck stuck by Matth\u00e4us. Coaching career One year after ending his illustrious playing career, Matth\u00e4us went into coaching, an activity where he has, so far, been much less distinguished. In his print interviews and other media appearances, he has been open about his goal and desire to coach in the German Bundesliga. His hope was that taking coaching jobs abroad would lead to offers from German clubs. When none came his way even after multiple foreign appointments, he often brought it up in the German press in-between his coaching stints. In a lengthy November 2009 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung interview, Matth\u00e4us complained about what he considers to be inadequate treatment he receives in Germany as a former great. He also bemoaned the lack of coaching job offers extended to him in the German Bundesliga\u2014claiming German clubs perceive him as too much of a Bayern supporter and too closely linked with the influential Bild tabloid newspaper to give him a job. Rapid Wien Matth\u00e4us in Vienna in January 2002. His first head coaching experience was at SK Rapid Wien in the Austrian Bundesliga , lasting from 6 September 2001 until 14 May 2002 with mixed results. Matth\u00e4us got Rapid Wien to the second round of the UEFA Cup , Round of 16 in the Austrian Cup , and finished in eighth place in Bundesliga . Partizan In December 2002, looking to replace their recently sacked head coach Ljubi\u0161a Tumbakovi\u0107 , Serbian club FK Partizan hired Matth\u00e4us during mid- season winter break, signing the German to an 18-month contract. Inheriting a team at the top of the league table, Matth\u00e4us achieved the immediate goal of steering Partizan to the 2002\u201303 league title; and did so in convincing fashion, extending the lead over the second-placed cross-town rivals Red Star Belgrade to 19 points at one point. The German's finest hour with the club, however, came in August 2003 when Partizan eliminated Newcastle United in the Champions League third qualifying round to reach the 2003\u201304 competition's group stage . Following the first leg 0\u20131 loss at home , Partizan improbably triumphed 0\u20131 away at St. James' Park against the third-placed English Premier League club , taking the tie to extra-time and eventually penalties. The penalty series brought further dramatic changes of momentum before right back Milivoje \u0106irkovi\u0107 's successful spot-kick in the seventh penalty round finally put Partizan through. Matth\u00e4us notably had his back turned to the pitch as couldn't bear to watch the drama of \u0106irkovi\u0107's penalty. Drawn in a tough group with Real Madrid , eventual champions FC Porto , and Olympique de Marseille , Partizan finished last thus missing out on the UEFA Cup spot. On 13 December 2003, right after finishing the final league match of the first half of the season before the winter break (0\u20131 win away at FK \u017deleznik ), Matth\u00e4us abruptly resigned his Partizan post by addressing the players and club leadership in private. A club spokesperson said Matth\u00e4us would clear everything up at a press conference scheduled for two days later, but it was already widely speculated through reports in the Hungarian press that the German had agreed terms with the Hungarian Football Federation to coach the Hungary national team . The rumours proved true as he officially signed the contract in Budapest and also got introduced to the media at Kempinski Hotel Corvinus . Four months after leaving Belgrade, in mid-April 2004, the row over the terms of Matth\u00e4us' contract with Partizan was opened with both parties publicly going back and forth at each other. It began with Matth\u00e4us, by now Hungarian national team head coach, giving a detailed interview to Serbian press and accusing Partizan club leadership of breaching the additional terms of his contract. It became known on that occasion that his initial contract with Partizan that had been finalized on 1 January 2003 included a base guaranteed part as well additional premium clauses giving him between 5\u201310% from players' transfers and shirt sponsorships as well as Champions League bonus incentives. Matth\u00e4us claimed that after none of that was honoured he gave up on asking for his percentages of the Danko Lazovi\u0107 and Zvonimir Vuki\u0107 transfers as well as Superfund shirt sponsorship deal due to \"not wanting to upset the team atmosphere during Champions League qualifying\", but instead pushed for the additional terms to be renegotiated. After successful Champions League qualification, the additional terms were in fact renegotiated with Partizan's general secretary \u017darko Ze\u010devi\u0107 so that both parties agreed to put the previous additional terms out of effect and instead now give Matth\u00e4us 15% of Igor Duljaj 's (the club's best young asset at the time) future transfer abroad as well as to allow Matth\u00e4us to leave the club any time he wanted without penalties. Duljaj was sold to Shakhtar Donetsk in January 2004 for US$4 million, and Matth\u00e4us claimed Partizan failed to pay him the agreed percentage ($600,000 or \u20ac469,500). The club responded two days later in a lengthy press release saying that they don't owe him any money. One day after that, Matth\u00e4us decided to sue Partizan for the amount of US$600,000 before Sports Arbitration Court in Lausanne , Switzerland. Hungarian national team Matth\u00e4us became manager of the Hungary national football team on 14 December 2003. Taking over the national team of a country once synonymous with world class football that had over the decades in the meantime fallen to the point of being unable to qualify for a major competition since the 1986 FIFA World Cup , Matth\u00e4us was given the task of qualifying for the 2006 World Cup as part of the Hungarian Football Federation 's (MLSZ) ambitious plan of returning on the path of former 1950s glory . After being drawn in a tough group with Sweden , Croatia and Bulgaria that goal looked increasingly difficult. The campaign started in the autumn of 2004 and fairly quickly it became obvious Hungary were in over their heads. Opening 3\u20130 loss away at Croatia in early September was somewhat offset four days later by a 3\u20132 hard fought home win versus Iceland . A month later, Matth\u00e4us' Hungary faced another important test away from home, this time at Sweden and once again it finished in disappointment with another demoralizing 3\u20130 loss. Before the winter break, Hungary managed to beat the minnows of the group Malta thus finishing the autumn part of the qualifying in fourth place with six points, mathematically still within striking distance of the leading trio. Notable was a 2\u20130 win in a friendly in Kaiserslautern against Germany on 6 June 2004. As the qualifiers resumed in late March 2005, Hungary hosted Bulgaria in what was pretty much a must win match for Matth\u00e4us' squad, however they only managed a draw right at the end with the goal coming in 90th minute for a 1\u20131 final scoreline. As Croatia and Sweden both won on the same occasion, the leading duo of teams now tangibly separated themselves from the pack of chasers, all of which meant that in order to qualify Hungary would have to win all its remaining fixtures and even get some outside help in terms of favourable results elsewhere. Such improbable scenario failed to materialize and they ended up in fourth place with 14 points from 10 matches, well behind Croatia and Sweden who earned 25 and 24 points, respectively. However, Matth\u00e4us was allowed to finish out the campaign behind the bench, and was even offered Hungarian citizenship , which he at the time said he would accept. There's no word whether he actually did. Matth\u00e4us left the Hungarian national team on 11 January 2006. After leaving the Hungary post, Matth\u00e4us was vocally critical of the Hungarian Football Federation (MLSZ), accusing it in November 2007 of \"not contributing, but exploiting Hungarian football\" before adding that \"it is not coincidental that the Hungarian bid to host Euro 2012 didn't receive any votes\". Athletico Paranaense Matth\u00e4us signed a one-year contract to coach Brazilian club Athletico Paranaense from the city of Curitiba on 11 January 2006. However, after only seven matches in charge (five wins, two draws) from the start of the 2006 Paran\u00e1 state championship , he quit the club in March 2006 citing the need to be closer to his family. The way he left raised some questions about his professionalism. Apparently, only five weeks after signing a contract he informed club officials about a need to rush back to Europe in order to deal with an urgent personal problem, but assured them he'd be back in 3\u20134 days. After missing for two weeks, he faxed in his resignation on 20 March and never even went back to Brazil to pick up his personal belongings. Some ten days later, Atl\u00e9tico put out a release mentioning that Matth\u00e4us ran up R$ 13,000 (US$5,915) in phone charges that the club wanted him to pay. The club even posted the bill on their website. Red Bull Salzburg On 19 May 2006, only two months following the bizarre Brazilian episode, Matth\u00e4us was announced as coach of Red Bull Salzburg (formerly Austria Salzburg) for the upcoming 2006\u201307 season . Shortly, the club also signed Giovanni Trapattoni (incidentally Matth\u00e4us' former coach at both Inter Milan and Bayern) to be their director of football. In practice, this meant that Trapattoni and Matth\u00e4us essentially shared coaching duties. Despite co-leading the team to the Austrian league title by a large margin, Matth\u00e4us would eventually be fired on 12 June 2007 by unanimous decision of the Red Bull Salzburg's board of directors. Maccabi Netanya On 13 April 2008, it was announced that Matth\u00e4us signed with Israeli club Maccabi Netanya to coach the team from the beginning of the 2008\u201309 season . On 29 April 2009, with the Israeli league season still ongoing and Netanya sitting in fourth place, it was announced that Matth\u00e4us will not be back for the second season once the current one is finished. The reason cited was the financial trouble that the club was going through. Matth\u00e4us' club finished the league season in fourth spot. Bulgaria national team Matth\u00e4us (right) during a friendly match against Serbia in November 2010 On 23 September 2010, it was announced that Matth\u00e4us would be the new coach of the Bulgarian national team after the resignation of Stanimir Stoilov a few weeks earlier. His contract was for one year with the option for a two-year extension. He started with a 1\u20130 win against Wales in Cardiff on his debut. Matth\u00e4us led Bulgaria to their first win in 2010 and in the UEFA Euro 2012 qualification campaign. On 12 October 2010, he led Bulgaria to a 2\u20130 win over Saudi Arabia in a friendly. On 17 November 2010, in a friendly played in Sofia , Bulgaria lost to Serbia 0\u20131. Despite winning his first match in the qualifiers against Wales, Bulgaria under Matth\u00e4us were unable to qualify for Euro 2012, following draws with Switzerland and Montenegro , as well as a home loss against England . On 19 September 2011, it was revealed that Matth\u00e4us had been sacked. The match against Switzerland was his final match. In April 2018, he was one of 77 applicants for the vacant Cameroon national team job. Columnist and TV pundit From 2001 until 2009, in parallel and in-between his coaching jobs, Matth\u00e4us wrote a column for the German weekly sports magazine Sport Bild . He also worked as in-studio TV pundit on a variety of television networks during big football competitions: for the German pay television channel Premiere during the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups, for the German channel ZDF during UEFA Euro 2004 , for Eurosport during UEFA Euro 2008 , for the Arabian network Al Jazeera Sports during the 2010 FIFA World Cup , for the Iranian channel IRIB during the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2015 AFC Asian Cup , and for the British TV network ITV during UEFA Euro 2016 . Since the 2012\u201313 Bundesliga season, he worked as an expert for the Pay TV broadcaster Sky Deutschland . He has further participated in a special \u00c9 Campe\u00e3o for the Brazilian channel SporTV . Style of play I admire Platini , I admire Maradona , but to win, I need Matth\u00e4us. \u2014 Giovanni Trapattoni , Matth\u00e4us' manager at Inter Milan and Bayern Munich . Renowned for his positioning, technical ability, stamina, passing, tackling, and powerful long range shooting abilities with either foot, Matth\u00e4us is widely considered by many to be one of the greatest and most complete midfielders of all time, and even by some as one of the greatest players of all time. Primarily a box-to-box midfielder , he was also capable of playing as an attacking or defensive midfielder . Journalist Jacques Thibert, writing for France Football , who awarded Matth\u00e4us the 1990 Ballon d'Or , described him as a player that despite not being sublime in anything individually, was good in every aspect of the game, which allowed him to be at ease in every area of the pitch. Furthermore, Thibert credited his Inter manager Giovanni Trapattoni for turning him into a more creative, assertive and rhythmic player. At Inter under Trapattoni, Matth\u00e4us excelled in a three-man midfield, either in a free role as a deep-lying playmaker , or even as an offensive left-sided central midfielder in the mezzala role on occasion, with either Gianfranco Matteoli or Sergio Battistini serving as defensive midfielder and Nicola Berti as a box-to-box midfielder. Well into his 30's and coupled with injuries led to then Germany national team manager Berti Vogts 's decision to convert Matth\u00e4us into a sweeper , a position that he would later play at his final five years in Bayern. As a sweeper, Matth\u00e4us enjoyed great freedom, as he could defend and make offensive runs into the opposing team's defensive area, and also exert influence into Bayern's attacking game due to his ability to read the game. Aside from his passing and long range shooting abilities, Matth\u00e4us was also an expert free kick and penalty taker, known for his powerful strikes from set pieces . In addition to his footballing skills, Matth\u00e4us was also praised for his winning mentality, determination, leadership, and commanding presence on the pitch, which made him a decisive player for his teams. Personal life Matth\u00e4us has four children, and has been married five times. During his first marriage (1981\u20131992), he had two daughters with wife Silvia. In 1994, he married Swiss model and TV presenter Lolita Morena with whom he had a son. The marriage ended in 1999. While coaching Partizan in Belgrade, Matth\u00e4us met 31-year-old Serbian socialite Marijana \u010coli\u0107 who became his third wife on 27 November 2003. By late 2007, the couple separated and she filed for divorce, which became official in late January 2009 following a year-long court case in Salzburg , Austria (their last residence) over the division of assets. In December 2008, 47-year-old Matth\u00e4us married 21-year-old Ukrainian model Kristina Liliana Chudinova. The ceremony was held in Las Vegas. They met a year earlier at the Oktoberfest beer festival in Munich. The couple lived in Tel Aviv , Israel, where Liliana studied journalism in a local university; but started living separately by early 2010. Matth\u00e4us married Anastasia Klimko in 2014 and they have a son. The marriage ended in 2021. In 2023, Matth\u00e4us became a co-owner of the Ghanaian football team Accra Lions . Media appearances Matth\u00e4us features in EA Sports ' FIFA video game series ; he was on the cover of the German edition of FIFA 2001 , and features in the FIFA 14 , FIFA 15 , FIFA 16 , FIFA 17 , FIFA 18 , FIFA 19 and FIFA 20 as an Ultimate Team Icon. Matth\u00e4us was also prominently featured in the opening video scene of EA's Euro 2000 video game , with Paul Oakenfold transforming the real Matth\u00e4us into an interactive digital player he controls in the game with his turntables. In August 2019, Matth\u00e4us became the face of turn-based football management game Football, Tactics & Glory ; he does not actually appear in the game itself.

Victor Skiff (July 23, 1908 \u2013 September 15, 1964) was a prominent New York State conservationist and career public servant. Public service positions in NYS included Superintendent of Inland Fisheries, Deputy Commissioner of Conservation, and acting Commissioner of Conservation. Childhood J. Victor Skiff was born July 23, 1908, to John Milton Skiff and Winifred E. Hughes, in Gainesville, NY. Victor's Mother, Winifred, died in 1917 at the age of 38. John M. Skiff was the editor of the Gainesville Press, and died of pneumonia following Spanish influenza, in 1918, orphaning Victor at the age of 10. He was then cared for by his uncle, Arthur Garfield Adams, and aunt, Minerva Adams (Skiff). As an adult, at a talk presented to Scouters of the Adirondack Council, he shared that \"his boyhood experience in a Scout Troop in Ithaca had developed his interest in the out-or-doors and led to his work in conservation.\" In 1926, at the age of 18, Victor married Kay Marie Sweeney. Education J Victor Skiff competing in the finals of the Eastman Stage Public Speaking Contest, Cornell University, 1928 Vic attended Ithaca Public Schools for 7th and 8th grade, finishing in 1922. For high school, he attended the world-renowned Starkey Seminary (later renamed Lakemont Academy for Boys ), located on Seneca Lake near Watkins Glen, NY, graduating in 1925. He began his undergraduate studies at Cornell University , in the fall of 1925. In his junior and senior year of college, he qualified for the finals of the 19th and 20th Annual Eastman Stage Contest, respectively, a public speaking contest held in connection with the annual Farm and Home week of the Agricultural College , speaking on the subject \"Will History Repeat?\" and \"Getting Your Money's Worth\" as a junior and senior, respectively. He graduated with a B.S. from the Agricultural College at Cornell in 1929. Early career He taught general science for three and a half years, from 1929 to 1932. During this period he was also active with the Boy Scouts. The summer after graduating from Cornell in 1929, he served as head of the Naturalists' Division of Camp Rodney in Maryland. He served as Scoutmaster of Troop No. 46 in Scotia, NY, from the fall of 1929 to the spring of 1930. Public career J. Victor Skiff was a career man in the New York State Department of Conservation, entering the department as a game research investigator in the Bureau of Game in 1933. He served as a game research investigator until 1937 when the position Assistant Superintendent of Game was created, and he was appointed to it. In 1938 he became Superintendent of Inland Fisheries. In 1941 he served as one of three commissioners from NYS on the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Compact Commission. In 1941 he also represented the NYS Conservation Department as a New York-Rhode Island Boundary Commissioner. In 1944 he was appointed Deputy Commissioner under the Republican administration of Thomas E. Dewey . He served as acting Commissioner after the death of then Commissioner John A. White on December 31, 1944, at age 43 until Governor Thomas E. Dewey appointed Perry Duryea as Commissioner in 1945. He was retained as Deputy by the newly appointed Commissioner Perry Duryea . In 1954, when Democrat W. Averell Harriman was elected as governor, Skiff resigned and served as a GOP legislative consultant. In 1959, when Republican Nelson Rockefeller took office as governor, Victor was reappointed as Deputy Commissioner, a position he served in until his untimely death in 1964. Personal life He was a member of the Fort Orange Club . He was one of the first vestrymen at St. David's Church in East Greenbush. Death J. Victor Skiff died on September 15, 1964, after suffering a heart attack, at the age of 56. Memorials to J. Victor Skiff J Victor Skiff Memorial Golf Course sign, c. 1964 J.

{"id": "doc_random_181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnair_Flight_915", "text": "Finnair Flight 915 (AY915) was a scheduled flight by Finnair from Tokyo , Japan , over the North Pole to Helsinki , Finland , on 23 December 1987. In 2014, Finnish media reported a claim by two of the flight's pilots that the Soviet Union had fired a missile at the aircraft, which exploded less than 30 seconds before impact. The allegations came out only in September 2014, when Helsingin Sanomat , the leading Finnish daily newspaper, published an extensive article on the matter. The Finnish Broadcasting Corporation YLE reported on the article on the Internet the same day. When the matter came out, it caused outrage in Finland among those politicians and civil servants, to whom it should have been reported at the time, and it was widely publicised and commented upon in the Finnish media, amidst allegations of Finlandization . The alleged incident has been compared to other similar incidents involving the Soviet Union, such as the Aero Kaleva in 1940, Aeroflot Flight 902 in 1962, Korean Air Lines Flight 902 in 1978, and Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in 1983. Co-captain Kaukiainen said that the Finnair pilots decided to speak out on the matter after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 had been shot down in Ukraine on 17 July 2014. Background Finnair was the first airline in the world to fly non-stop scheduled flights between Europe and Japan starting in 1983. The aircraft they used was McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30ERs , which had extra fuel tanks fitted in the cargo space that enabled the plane to take on 24,000 litres (5,300\u00a0imp\u00a0gal; 6,300\u00a0US\u00a0gal) of additional fuel. This made it possible to cover the 5,413 nautical miles (10,025\u00a0km; 6,229\u00a0mi) from Tokyo to Helsinki on a non-stop flight that lasted 13 hours. The flight was carried out in international air space, over the North Pole, since the Soviet Union had demanded extra payments for flights over its territory in Siberia , in addition to ordinary navigation fees. The range of the aircraft of other western airlines did not allow for such flights, and they landed in Anchorage , Alaska , for refuelling. Japanese airlines did not fly non-stop over Siberia, as they thought that the Soviet Union would have demanded bilateral flight rights in return. Flight The aircraft involved was a DC-10-30/ER leased to Finnair and flying in Finnair livery . It was originally registered in Finland with the registration OH-LHC, but it was mostly known for its re-registration in the United States as N345HC. It was built and delivered to Finnair in 1981. The same aircraft was later painted with Moomin characters. It was used by Finnair between 1981 and 1995, although on two occasions in the 1990s it was leased to Garuda Indonesia . The Finnair aircraft had taken off from Tokyo's Narita International Airport almost on schedule , around 10 a.m. Japanese time (3 a.m. Finnish time) on 23 December 1987, and it carried 201 passengers , four pilots , and 12 Finnish and 2 Japanese flight attendants . The cruising altitude was 10,600\u00a0m (34,800\u00a0ft). The flight proceeded north from Tokyo to Bering Strait and on over the North Pole and then with the aid of an inertial navigation system south toward Svalbard and on toward Helsinki. Before the Bering Strait, the plane crossed the International Date Line over the Aleutian Islands and thus for some time flew during the previous day, 22 December. Events According to the pilots' 2014 report of the incident, when the aircraft was over the Edge\u00f8ya island of Svalbard, between 1 and 2 p.m. Finnish time, the assistant pilot in command Esko Kaukiainen and assistant first officer Markku Soininen saw a rocket approaching the aircraft ahead, at 30 degrees to the left of the flight path of the plane. The pilot in command and the first officer were having a rest at the time. Visibility was good, and the pilots followed the flight of the rocket for more than half a minute. At first, they thought it was a Soviet weather rocket on its way to the troposphere , but when it reached the cruising altitude of the aircraft, it turned and came straight at it. Then the rocket exploded. It was clear to the pilots that the rocket had been locked to its target, the Finnair aircraft. The inertial navigation system equipment of the aircraft allowed the crew to determine their position. After the explosion, Kaukiainen started a stopwatch . 60 to 80 seconds later the aircraft came to the dust cloud left by the explosion. With the cruising speed of the aircraft being 900\u00a0km/h (560\u00a0mph) and that of the missile at least 1,800\u00a0km/h (1,100\u00a0mph), the pilots calculated that the explosion had taken place only about 20 seconds before impact. The pilots watched as the hull of the missile fell down towards the sea in a spirallike motion. The pilot in command came to the cockpit later and took care of the landing at about 4 p.m. Finnish time. The pilots who had been in the cockpit during the events reported orally to him. Conjectures about the events The pilots had no doubt the missile had come from somewhere in the Soviet Union. They surmised that it had been fired from the Kola Peninsula or from a submarine . When they talked to Helsingin Sanomat in 2014, they said they thought it had been some kind of exercise. They thought that either things had gone as planned in the exercise, or then they had gone wrong. In case it had gone according to plan, it meant that the Finnair aircraft had been used for target practice . One possibility they had considered was that it was a missile gone astray, as had been the case three years previously with the so-called Lake Inari missile incident in the north of Finland. Professor Stefan Forss Ph.D. from the Strategic and Defence Studies of the National Defence University of Finland , a specialist in the technology of war, especially that of nuclear weapons systems, pointed out that missile could not have been a conventional ground-launched ballistic or cruise missiles with intermediate range , which were due to be eliminated as a result of Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces or INF Treaty ratified between the United States and the Soviet Union ratified in early 1987, as the elimination of these missiles began only in late July the following year. Turun Sanomat , a daily newspaper published in Turku , Finland, interviewed Colonel Ahti Lappi (retired), who worked from 1988 to 1996 as the anti-aircraft inspector of the Finnish Defence Forces , in the highest position in this branch of the defence forces. Lappi stated the following things: The path of the missile, in particular the fact that it changed its course, suggests a surface-to-air missile . Ballistic missiles do not have the ability to change their courses at an altitude exceeding 10,000 metres (33,000\u00a0ft). He says he believes the pilots' observations were accurate. Soviet territories, those of Novaya Zemlya and the Kola Peninsula , were too far away from Svalbard even for the heaviest anti-aircraft weapons of the time. Thus Lappi was inclined to believe that the missile was fired from a surface vessel. According to Lappi, the explosion of the missile in mid-air is a mystery. He does not remember any missile from the 1980s that could have been detonated from the ground with remote control. Surface-to-air missiles have self-destruction systems , which detonate the charge automatically before the end of the trajectory of the missile (possibly meaning before they hit the ground). Lappi thought that the missile could have been a S-125 Pechora , which within NATO is called SA-3 Goa, of which there is a version that is used on surface vessels. It was used by the Soviet Union and as of 2014 was still being used in dozens of countries. Its ceiling is 17 kilometres (11\u00a0mi; 9.2\u00a0nmi) and it has a range of 27 kilometres (17\u00a0mi; 15\u00a0nmi). The huge dust cloud, however, speaks against a Pechora missile, in Lappi's opinion. The 60 kilograms (130\u00a0lb) charge of the missile does not produce an explosion that would be spectacular. Lack of reports The pilots had agreed that the pilot in command would file a report after the flight, as it was his duty to report on such matters. Kaukiainen reminded him of this on two occasions in the weeks following the alleged incident. However, it seems the pilot in command never did do it, due in part to the fact that the celebration of Christmas interfered with the process. Kaukiainen also speculated that perhaps he did not want to write it, as he had not witnessed the incident himself, and it would have been difficult for him to argue that it had taken place. When the Helsingin Sanomat article came out in 2014, he had already died. Lauri J. Laine, retired director of flights for Finnair at the time, confirmed that no report was ever written about the incident. However, the events had been discussed within Finnair, especially in pilot training. One Finnair official from the flights direction team, who chose to remain anonymous, told Helsingin Sanomat that he had heard about the incident at the time: \"It was talked about. Other pilots also said that they saw explosions on that particular route. Were they perhaps missile tests?\" Kaukiainen also related the incident to at least one official within the Finnish Civil Aviation Administration which in 2014 is called Finavia . But it turned out that there was little interest in the matter within the Finnish government, because \"people were so damned Finlandized back then, especially within the Finnish Government \". In 2014 the Finnish Transport Safety Agency (TraFi) had no knowledge of the matter, and reports or flight log books for 1987 no longer existed. The co-captain of the flight said in an interview with HSTV, a video service of Helsingin Sanomat that he thought of the incident again after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 had been shot down in Ukraine on 17 July 2014. The surviving pilots, both of whom witnessed the missile and its explosion from the cockpit, then decided to speak about the incident in public. Pekka Henttu, director of the aviation department at TraFi, said that today such an incident would not be hushed. It is likely that the authorities and the top executives of the airline would have been informed of it even before the plane lands. Reactions by former ministers and the head of the Finnish Security Intelligence Service Pekka Vennamo , who was the Minister of Transport in 1987, as well as Pertti Salolainen , who was the Minister of Foreign Trade at the time, only heard about the incident when they read the Helsingin Sanomat article in September 2014. The same was the case with Seppo Tiitinen , Director of the Finnish Security Intelligence Service at the time. Tiitinen said that \"the matter would absolutely been of interest within the Security Intelligence Service \u2026 Information concerning an incident like this should have been passed on automatically from civil servants in the aviation branch to the authorities \u2014 then just as now. \u2026 It would have been passed on to the top people in the government, and they would have decided whether some kind of action would have been required.\" Salolainen is said to have been enraged when he read about the incident. He considers the incident to have been \"outrageous\", and he continued saying that \"it would not have been civilized behaviour, it would have been low-life military gangsterism , if the description of the events is accurate.\" Salolainen said that even in 2014 information is withheld from the Parliament of Finland and the ministers of the government \"in a manner that is deplorable.\" Vennamo stated that \"it is a heinous offence if the Finnair plane had indeed been used for target practice.\" See also List of airliner shootdown incidents References ^ a b c d e f g Huhtanen, Ann-Mari (7 September 2014). \" 'Perhana, se tulee suoraan kohti.'

{"id": "doc_random_183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scars_of_Mirrodin", "text": "Scars of Mirrodin is a Magic: The Gathering block, consisting of the expansion sets Scars of Mirrodin (October 1, 2010), Mirrodin Besieged (February 4, 2011) and New Phyrexia . This block marked the return to the plane of Mirrodin . This plane was last visited in the Mirrodin block that concluded in 2004. The interim tagline for the set was \"The Corrosion Begins October 1, 2010.\" The plans for this set were first made public by mananation.com when it was discovered that \"Scars of Mirrodin\", as well as \"Mirrodin Pure\" and \"New Phyrexia\" had been registered as trademarks with the US Patent and Trademark Office by Wizards of the Coast. As with the original Mirrodin block, artifacts make up the overarching theme of Scars of Mirrodin ; Nearly half of all cards in the set are artifacts. In his May 24 column, Mark Rosewater confirmed that the \"Infect\" game mechanic in Scars of Mirrodin would bring poison counters back to Magic. All cards (other than basic lands) in the Scars of Mirrodin block carried a watermark, either Mirran or Phyrexian. Storyline The origins of New Phyrexia date back to the early design stages of the original Mirrodin set. The idea of Phyrexian oil influencing Mirrodin's evolution was included in the storyline for future use. New Phyrexia was originally planned to be the first set of the \"Lights\" block, with the storyline being set after the Phyrexians had already conquered Mirrodin. Eventually, designer Mark Rosewater made the decision to build the block around the war between the Mirrans and the Phyrexians, leading up to New Phyrexia after Scars of Mirrodin and Mirrodin Besieged . In the original announcement from December 9, 2010 it was left open whether this set would be named New Phyrexia or Mirrodin Pure . On March 29, 2011 Wizards of the Coast announced that New Phyrexia was going to be the name of the set. The tagline for Mirrodin Pure would have been \"The Sharpest Steel is Tempered in Fire\". Mechanics Scars of Mirrodin introduced the Phyrexian mechanics Infect and Proliferate , and the Mirran mechanics Metalcraft and Imprint . A creature with infect deals damage to creatures in the form of -1/-1 counters (much like Wither ) and to players in the form of poison counters. A player with 10 or more poison counters loses the game. Proliferate allows players to give additional counters to any number of permanents and/or players they so choose who already have them. Imprint was a returning keyword from the original Mirrodin block, and allowed an artifact to gain additional effects if another card is exiled and imprinted on that artifact. Metalcraft rewards a player for having three or more artifacts in play. As with the original Mirrodin block, artifacts that were Equipment and/or were indestructible were printed. Besides expanding on mechanics from Scars , Mirrodin Besieged introduced the Mirran mechanic Battle Cry , and the Phyrexian mechanic Living Weapon . Whenever a creature with battle cry attacks, all other attacking creatures that player or team controls get +1/+0 until the end of the turn. Living weapon is found only on Equipment. When a piece of Equipment with \"Living weapon\" enters the battlefield, it creates a 0/0 Black Germ creature token and the Equipment is immediately attached to that token. It expanded on the poison counters mechanic by making certain things happen if players were poisoned. The four mechanics from Scars and living weapon returned for New Phyrexia . New Phyrexia introduced also Phyrexian Mana Symbols . Mana costs containing Phyrexian mana symbols can be paid with either the given color or two life per Phyrexian Mana symbol. In New Phyrexia , all permanent cards with Phyrexian Mana in their costs are colored artifacts. Notable cards Notable cards from Scars of Mirrodin include Mox Opal , Memnite and Sword of Body and Mind . Notable cards from Mirrodin Besieged include Blightsteel Colossus , Sword of Feast and Famine and Green Sun's Zenith . Notable cards from New Phyrexia include Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite , Birthing Pod , Dismember , Mental Misstep , Gitaxian Probe , Karn Liberated and Sword of War and Peace , which completed the Swords cycle begun in the Mirrodin block.

{"id": "doc_random_186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuto_de_Dios", "text": "logo of Minuto de Dios Minuto de Dios (in English Minute of God ) is a Colombian non-profit Catholic religious organization founded by Rafael Garc\u00eda Herreros . In 1950, Garc\u00eda Herreros began a daily, minute-long radio program under the name The Minute of God . The program went on national television in 1955 and has aired more than 17,000 times since then, making it the longest-running program on Colombian television. History The campus of UNIMINUTO In 1950, Father Rafael Garc\u00eda Herreros began a daily radio program on Emisoras Fuentes in Cartagena . The program lasted just eight months, as the priest traveled to Europe, and returned on stations in other cities in December 1951. On January 10, 1957, this program made the leap to the then-new national television network, where it began airing for one minute every weeknight at 7 p.m. Its uninterrupted airing has continued to this day, making it the oldest program on Colombian television. in the 1990s, this expanded to include the then-new private networks, RCN and Caracol , which are required to carry the program. Minuto de Dios began as a radio program that reflect on God, the human being, and the responsibilities all christians have with their society and its transformation. Within weeks of beginning the program, Father Garc\u00eda Herreros was approached by the Beneficencia de Cundinamarca and offered a monthly sponsorship of 1,500 pesos, which the priest promptly distributed in three installments to the poor. When he ran out of money, a prostitute approached him and gave him another 500 pesos. Soon, the ministry began to construct houses for the poor, in an illegal shantytown near the Bogot\u00e1 Military Hospital. However, when the owner of the land took action against the illegal construction, Antonio Restrepo Barco stepped up and donated the first parcel of land in what would become the Barrio Minuto de Dios. The first home was built on the site in 1957, and the next year, the Corporaci\u00f3n Minuto de Dios was founded, marking the beginnings of wider social activity. The neighborhood later grew to have a museum, children's crafts center and park. In 1961, Garc\u00eda Herreros had another idea: to create a charity event in which \"the rich ate like the poor\". The result was the Banquete del Mill\u00f3n (Banquet of the Million), which was first held on November 25, 1961 and has been organized every year since. Minuto de Dios's religious activities continued to grow, and so too did its profile. When President Belisario Betancur received the Prince of Asturias Award in 1983, he donated its prize money to Minuto de Dios. President Betancur also protected Minuto de Dios from the frequent bidding cycles by which Colombian television companies and programs were selected, stating that \"God does not need to present a bid\". It established a programadora , Lumen 2000, whose primary purpose was to provide religious programming for public television. The largest and most significant expansion came in 1990, when the Corporaci\u00f3n Universitaria Minuto de Dios (Minuto de Dios University Corporation, abbreviated UNIMINUTO), was established, with its main campus in the Barrio Minuto de Dios. Garc\u00eda Herreros remained the host of the program until his death in 1992; he died the night of that year's Banquete del Mill\u00f3n. He was succeeded by Father Diego Jaramillo, who continues to host the program and heads the ministry. Aside from substitute hosts, who come from the same Congregation of Jesus and Mary ministry as Garc\u00eda Herreros and Jaramillo, there have been only two regular hosts in the program's history. In 2015, the Corporaci\u00f3n Minuto de Dios celebrated the 60th anniversary of the TV program by unveiling a mosaic depicting the face of Father Garc\u00eda Herreros, measuring 9.24 metres (30.3\u00a0ft) in height and 7.5 metres (25\u00a0ft) in width. Activities Housing By 2005, the ministry's 50th anniversary, Minuto de Dios had constructed some 50,000 housing units. Broadcasting Minuto de Dios remains active in broadcasting. The corporation also operates four broadcast radio stations, on 107.9 FM in Bogot\u00e1 , 89.5 FM in Cartagena , 1230 AM in Medell\u00edn and 1370 AM in Barranquilla . The first of these stations, in Bogot\u00e1, was established on May 7, 1987. Additionally, Minuto de Dios controls a media company known as Lumen (formerly Lumen 2000), which started in 1991 as a programadora providing religious programming to public television and has since expanded to event production and large-format printing, though it continues to produce the Minuto de Dios capsules. Social industry In 1992, Minuto de Dios opened a confectionery geared toward producing candy for export, with the goal of creating 25,000 new jobs. Other UNIMINUTO endeavors include Fundases, which provides agricultural consulting services, and a chain of bookstores. University The Corporaci\u00f3n Universitaria Minuto de Dios (UNIMINUTO), founded in 1990, educates more than 100,000 students. Other Minuto de Dios is involved in healthcare, controlling a health corporation ( Corporaci\u00f3n de Salud Minuto de Dios ). It also operates the Fundaci\u00f3n Eudes, which provides treatment for patients with HIV/AIDS.

{"id": "doc_random_187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gerson", "text": "Michael John Gerson (May 15, 1964 \u2013 November 17, 2022) was an American journalist and speechwriter. He was a neoconservative op-ed columnist for The Washington Post , a Policy Fellow with One Campaign , a visiting fellow with the Center for Public Justice , and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations . He served as President George W. Bush 's chief speechwriter from 2001 until June 2006, as a senior policy advisor from 2000 through June 2006, and was a member of the White House Iraq Group . Gerson helped write the inaugural address for the second inauguration of George W. Bush , which called for neo-conservative intervention and nation-building around the world to effect the spread of democracy to third world countries. In 2018, Gerson and commentator Amy Holmes co-hosted In Principle , a politically conservative-oriented television talk show that ran for eight episodes on PBS . Early life and education Gerson was born on May 15, 1964, in Belmar, New Jersey , and raised in an Evangelical Christian family in St. Louis, Missouri . He attended Westminster Christian Academy for high school. His paternal grandfather was Jewish. He attended Georgetown University for a year and then transferred to Wheaton College in Illinois, graduating in 1986. Career Dan Bartlett , Brett Kavanaugh , Condoleezza Rice , and Gerson review President George W. Bush 's State of the Union speech in 2004. Before joining the Bush administration, he was a senior policy advisor with The Heritage Foundation , a conservative public policy research institution. He also worked at various times as an aide to Indiana Senator Dan Coats and a speechwriter for the presidential campaign of Bob Dole before briefly leaving the political world to cover it as a journalist for U.S. News & World Report . Gerson also worked at one point as a ghostwriter for Charles Colson . In early 1999, Karl Rove recruited Gerson for the Bush campaign. Gerson was named by Time as one of \"The 25 Most Influential Evangelicals In America.\" The February 7, 2005, issue listed Gerson as the ninth-most influential evangelical that year. Speechwriter Gerson joined the Bush campaign before 2000 as a speechwriter and went on to head the White House speechwriting team. \"No one doubts that he did his job exceptionally well,\" wrote Ramesh Ponnuru in a 2007 article otherwise very critical of Gerson in National Review . According to Ponnuru, Bush's speechwriters had more prominence in the administration than their predecessors did under previous presidents because Bush's speeches did most of the work of defending the president's policies, since administration spokesmen and press conferences did not. On the other hand, he wrote, the speeches would announce new policies that were never implemented, making the speechwriting in some ways less influential than ever. On June 14, 2006, it was announced that Gerson was leaving the White House to pursue other writing and policy work. He was replaced as Bush's chief speechwriter by The Wall Street Journal chief editor William McGurn . Lines attributed to Gerson Gerson proposed the use of a \"smoking gun/mushroom cloud\" mixed-metaphor during a September 5, 2002, meeting of the White House Iraq Group , in an effort to sell the American public on the nuclear dangers posed by Saddam Hussein . According to Newsweek columnist Michael Isikoff , The original plan had been to place it in an upcoming presidential speech, but WHIG members fancied it so much that when the Times reporters contacted the White House to talk about their upcoming piece [about aluminum tubes], one of them leaked Gerson's phrase \u2013 and the administration would soon make maximum use of it. Gerson said one of his favorite speeches was given at the National Cathedral on September 14, 2001, a few days after the September 11 attacks , which included the following passage: \"Grief and tragedy and hatred are only for a time. Goodness, remembrance, and love have no end. And the Lord of life holds all who die, and all who mourn.\" Gerson was credited with coining such phrases as \"the soft bigotry of low expectations\" and \"the armies of compassion\". His noteworthy phrases for Bush are said to include \" Axis of Evil ,\" a phrase adapted from \"axis of hatred,\" itself suggested by fellow speechwriter David Frum but deemed too mild. Criticism of Gerson's speechwriting In an article by Matthew Scully , one of Bush's speechwriters, published in The Atlantic in September 2007, Gerson was criticized for seeking the limelight, taking credit for other people's work and creating a false image of himself. \"No good deed went unreported, and many things that never happened were reported as fact. For all of our chief speechwriter's finer qualities, the firm adherence to factual narrative is not a strong point.\" Of particular note is the invention of the phrase \"axis of evil.\" Scully claims that the phrase \"axis of hatred\" was coined by David Frum and forwarded to colleagues by email. The word \"hatred\" was changed to \"evil\" by someone other than Gerson and was changed because \"hatred\" seemed the more melodramatic word at the time. Scully also had this to say about Gerson: My most vivid memory of Mike at Starbucks is one I have labored in vain to shake. We were working on a State of the Union address in John [McConnell]'s office when suddenly Mike was called away for an unspecified appointment, leaving us to 'keep going'. We learned only later, from a chance conversation with his secretary, where he had gone, and it was a piece of Washington self-promotion for the ages: At the precise moment when the State of the Union address was being drafted at the White House by John and me, Mike was off [at a Washington D.C. Starbucks store] pretending to craft the State of the Union in longhand for the benefit of a reporter. Washington Post columnist After leaving the White House, Gerson wrote for Newsweek magazine for a time. On May 16, 2007, Gerson began his tenure as a twice-weekly columnist for The Washington Post . His columns appeared on Wednesdays and Fridays. Gerson, a neo-conservative, repeatedly criticized other conservatives in his column and conservatives returned the favor. One of Gerson's first columns was entitled \"Letting Fear Rule\", in which he compared skeptics of President Bush's immigration reform bill to nativist bigots of the 1880s. In October 2017, Gerson referred to President Donald Trump 's \"fundamental unfitness for high office\" and asked whether he is \"psychologically and morally equipped to be president? And could his unfitness cause permanent damage to the country?\" He cited \"the leaked cries for help coming from within the administration. They reveal a president raging against enemies, obsessed by slights, deeply uninformed and incurious, unable to focus, and subject to destructive whims.\" In August 2019, Gerson wrote that it is a \"scandal\" that \"white evangelical Protestants\" are not in a state of \"panic\" about their own demographic decline in the United States. One of the last articles he wrote was an essay on the continuing alliance between evangelical Christians and Donald Trump in 2022 and his belief that such an alliance was foolish and unchristian. Personal life Gerson's wife Dawn was born in South Korea . She was adopted by an American family when she was six years old and raised in the Midwestern United States . The couple met in high school, and have two sons. They resided in Northern Virginia . Health and death Gerson suffered from major depressive disorder , and was hospitalized at least once for it. In 2013, Gerson was diagnosed with kidney cancer . He also had Parkinson's disease . He died from kidney cancer at a Washington, D.C. hospital, on November 17, 2022, at age 58.

{"id": "doc_random_188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Kappa_Epsilon", "text": "Delta Kappa Epsilon ( \u0394\u039a\u0395 ), commonly known as DKE or Deke , is one of the oldest fraternities in the United States, with fifty-six active chapters and five active colonies across North America. It was founded at Yale College in 1844 by fifteen sophomores who were discontented with the existing fraternity order on campus. The men established a fellowship where the candidate most favored was \"he who combined in the most equal proportions the Gentleman , the Scholar , and the Jolly Good Fellow.\" History Delta Kappa Epsilon was founded on June 22, 1844 , in room number twelve in the corner of Old South Hall on the campus of Yale College in New Haven, Connecticut . Its fifteen founders were: William Woodruff Atwater Edward Griffin Bartlett Frederic Peter Bellinger Jr. Henry Case George Foote Chester John Butler Conyngham Thomas Isaac Franklin William Walter Horton William Boyd Jacobs Edward VanSchoonhoven Kinsley Chester Newell Righter Elisha Bacon Shapleigh Thomas DuBois Sherwood Albert Everett Stetson Orson William Stow At this meeting, the Fraternity's secret and open Greek mottos were devised, as were the lapel pin design and secret grip. The open motto became \u2013 \"Kerothen Philoi Aei\" \u2013 \"Friends From The Heart, Forever.\" Central to the values of Delta Kappa Epsilon are its objects: The objects of Delta Kappa Epsilon are the cultivation of general literature and social culture, the advancement and encouragement of intellectual excellence, the promotion of honorable friendship and useful citizenship, the development of a spirit of tolerance and respect for the rights and views of others, the maintenance of gentlemanly dignity, self-respect, and morality in all circumstances, and the union of stout hearts and kindred interests to secure to merit its due reward. Within five years of the founding of Phi chapter at Yale, chapters were installed at Bowdoin College , Princeton University , Colby College , Amherst College , University of Nashville , and the University of Alabama . Despite traditionally selecting and installing \u0394\u039a\u0395 chapters along the Eastern Seaboard, \u0394\u039a\u0395 holds a strong reputation as a Southern fraternity. Between 1845 and 1846, thirteen of the 38 of the active members of the Phi chapter at Yale were Southerners. While Vanderbilt University was not founded until 1873, the Gamma chapter of \u0394\u039a\u0395 was founded in Nashville 25 years earlier, in 1847. Also that year, the Psi chapter at University of Alabama and then Chi chapter at Mississippi would firmly root Delta Kappa Epsilon as an institution steeped in southern heritage. Delta Kappa Epsilon's first West Coast chapter was founded at the University of California, Berkeley on Halloween night, 1876. The Mu chapter at Colgate University in Hamilton, New York , is one of the few with a Temple, open only to DKE member initiates of the Mu chapter . The Lambda chapter at Kenyon College built the first fraternity lodge in 1854. Delta Kappa Epsilon became an international fraternity with the addition of the Alpha Phi chapter in 1898 at the University of Toronto , Canada. Expansion to the United Kingdom had little success. Today, \u0394\u039a\u0395 chapters are located only in the United States and Canada. The Delta Kappa Epsilon house at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York The fraternity's first convention was held in New Haven, Connecticut on December 23, 1946. Symbols The \u0394\u039a\u0395 Flag consists of three bands of color: Azure (blue, truth), Or (gold, fidelity), and Gules (crimson, courage) with a dexter rampant lion in the middle band. \u0394\u039a\u0395 flags have been carried to the North Pole by its discoverer, Admiral Robert Peary and to the Moon by astronaut Alan Bean . Adorning the active pin are the Greek letters \u0394 \u039a \u0395 etched downward, diagonally across an ivory scroll and centered atop an onyx diamond, encased in rope-textured gold trim and stars gracing each of the four corners. Active members' initials for their given name and number as initiated in the chapter complete the active pin. Delta Kappa Epsilon pledges wear a triangle-shaped lapel pin with the same heraldic colors of Azure, Champagne & Crimson, with red facing upward & always on collared shirts. Activities Community service is a major focus for each chapter of \u0394\u039a\u0395 , in addition to the social aspect that integrates collegiate academics with Greek system of fraternities and sororities . Chapters compete and are awarded equally on merits of leadership , chapter improvement and community service . The Lion Trophy is awarded each year to the chapter with most notable achievements in each category. Chapters Main article: List of Delta Kappa Epsilon chapters \u0394\u039a\u0395 has grown to fifty-six chapters and has initiated over 85,000 members across North America. Delta Kappa Epsilon Club of New York The Yale Club of New York City 's main entrance on Vanderbilt Avenue in Midtown Manhattan , home of the Delta Kappa Epsilon Club of New York Members of Delta Kappa Epsilon who have completed their undergraduate education are eligible for membership in The Delta Kappa Epsilon Club of New York. The DKE Club was founded on May 9, 1885, occupying several clubhouses in Midtown Manhattan , including 30 West 44th Street which it purchased from The Yale Club of New York City in 1916. After renovations totaling $75,000, the clubhouse opened in January 1917. However, just nine years later the Club relocated again when it sold the building to the Army and Navy Club of New York. Partially due to the Great Depression , in 1932, the DKE Club entered into an affiliation with the Yale Club of New York whereby members would have the same access to its clubhouse and facilities as the 11,000 members of the Yale Club itself. Designed by James Gamble Rogers , the clubhouse is located at 50 Vanderbilt Avenue across from Grand Central Terminal . Upon opening its doors in 1915, the building became the largest clubhouse in the world and continues to be the largest college clubhouse in existence today. The club has often hosted dinners and other events for notable alumni members of the fraternity such as polar explorer Robert Peary (who took a Deke flag to the North Pole with him in 1909). Notable members Main article: List of Delta Kappa Epsilon members President Theodore Roosevelt United States presidents Rutherford B. Hayes , Kenyon Theodore Roosevelt , Harvard Franklin D. Roosevelt , Harvard Gerald Ford , Michigan George H. W. Bush , Yale George W. Bush , Yale Vice presidents Dan Quayle , DePauw Theodore Roosevelt , Harvard Gerald Ford , Michigan George H. W. Bush , Yale Other notable members Many American and Canadian politicians, businessmen, sports figures, and artists have been members, including Joe Paterno , Herb Kelleher , J.P. Morgan, Jr. , William Randolph Hearst , Cole Porter , Brett Kavanaugh , Ron DeSantis , Bradley Palmer , Henry Cabot Lodge , Dick Clark , Tom Landry , David Milch , and George Steinbrenner . \u0394\u039a\u0395 flags were carried to the North Pole by its discoverer, Admiral Robert Peary and to the moon by astronaut Alan Bean . During the Civil War , the first Union officer killed in battle was member Theodore Winthrop of Phi chapter . A poem published in 1897, titled Brothers in DKE , was based on an anecdote of a Union soldier, Edwin S. Rogers of Maine, who was mortally wounded on 7 June 1864, at the Battle of Cold Harbor . An unnamed confederate soldier happened upon Rogers, who was wearing a DKE pin on his uniform. As the confederate soldier was also a DKE member, he gave aid and comfort to his fraternity brother, until he died shortly after. The soldier then sent the pin to Rogers family. During the Spanish\u2013American War , the first American officer to be killed was a fraternity member, Surgeon John B. Gibbs ( Phi Chi ). \u0394\u039a\u0395 member J. Frank Aldritch ( Psi Phi ) died when the USS Maine was sunk. The fraternity has fifteen Medal of Honor recipients: George N. Bliss ( Delta ), Deming Bronson ( Kappa Epsilon ), Allen Buchanan ( Psi Phi ), Richard E. Fleming (Phi Epsilon), George W. Ford ( Zeta ), Webb Hayes ( Delta Chi ), Ruel Milton Johnson ( Omicron ), Charles Mattocks ( Theta ), Samuel E. Pingree ( Pi ), Adolphus Staton ( Beta ), Wager Swayne ( Phi ), Edward N. Whittier ( Upsilon ), and Eri D. Woodbury ( Sigma ). Yung Wing , the first Chinese graduate from an American university in 1854, was a member of the Phi chapter . Controversies and member misconduct In 1846, one year after establishing the Zeta chapter at Princeton University and reportedly very unpopular with staff, the chapter was kicked off campus. The chapter was reinstated six years later and again removed from campus and the charter revoked. Only 69 members were initiated during the chapter's brief existence. On June 6, 1892, a pledge was led blindfolded through the street during his fraternity initiation towards Moriarty's Cafe, a popular student hang-out. He was told to run and did so at top speed. He ran into a sharp carriage pole, injuring himself. He was rendered unconscious, but the injury was not thought to be serious at the time. He suffered an intestinal rupture and died five days later of peritonitis. In 1967, The New York Times reported on \"frat-branding\", the alleged use of a hot branding iron to make a \u0394 shaped scar on new fraternity members. The Yale chapter's then-president George W. Bush stated that they were \"only cigarette burns.\" In New Orleans in 1987, dozens of \u0394\u039a\u0395 fraternity members marched in blackface in a parade in broad daylight. In 1989, Colgate University banned all \u0394\u039a\u0395 activities after the officials found members guilty of hazing , blackballing and other violations of university regulations. In 2005 Colgate University barred the fraternity from campus for refusing to sell its house to the school and join a new student-residence initiative. \u0394\u039a\u0395 filed a lawsuit charging that the school violated its right to free association as well as antitrust laws by monopolizing the student housing market. In 2006, the Supreme Court of Madison County found that the fraternity had failed to state a cause of action and that its claim was \"time-barred.\" In 1989, Virginia Tech banned all \u0394\u039a\u0395 activities on campus and asked the national office to revoke its charter after reports of a racially tinged hazing incident during a pledge trip to Kenyon College in Ohio surfaced on campus. After the allegations emerged the Virginia Tech administration under President James D. McComas acted swiftly and terminated the registration of DKE and ended its affiliation with the university less than a week later. Allegedly, a white \u0394\u039a\u0395 pledge had asked a black student at a Kenyon College party in Gambier, Ohio if he could kiss her while another pledge photographed them. The pledge had been instructed to do something unusual during the trip and bring back photos to prove it. After friends of the woman learned of the incident, an argument ensued and the Virginia Tech pledges were escorted off the Kenyon College campus. Its charter was not revoked and the DKE chapter continued to operate in its off-campus house in Blacksburg despite the ban. Through the efforts of influential Virginia Tech DKE alumni and university donors, the chapter was ultimately re-instated in the mid-1990s. In 1997, members of \u0394\u039a\u0395 at Loyola University New Orleans and Tulane University invited students to celebrate Martin Luther King's Birthday \"with fried chicken from Popeye's, watermelon and a \u2018forty\u2019 .\u201d In December 2008, the University of California, Berkeley suspended recognition of the local DKE chapter for alcohol, hazing, and fire safety misconduct. The chapter never closed and continued without affiliation or oversight by UC Berkeley. The national office and the alumni association maintained their association with the local chapter. Four years later, the chapter opted not to reapply for recognition by the university and continued as an independent fraternity. In May 2012, during a routine patrol of the campus, the County Vice Enforcement Team visited the chapter. Several citations were issued for underage drinking. In October 2010, Phi chapter at Yale came under fire after its members shouted inflammatory and misogynistic chants at an Old Campus pledge ritual, including \" No means yes . Yes means anal \". The chapter's president, Jordan Forney, apologized for the fraternity's conduct, characterizing it as a \"lapse in judgment.\" but Yale's feminist magazine Broad Recognition called for administrative action against the leadership of \u0394\u039a\u0395 . By October 24, 2010, Dean Mary Miller of Yale College had strongly recommended to the \u0394\u039a\u0395 National Executive Director, Dr. Douglas Lanpher, that the chapter at Yale be put on probation indefinitely. Instead, on May 17, 2011, the chapter was suspended for five years. The order barred \u0394\u039a\u0395 from conducting any activities on the Yale campus during that time. In January 2011, the \u0394\u039a\u0395 chapter at the University of Alberta had its student group status suspended for five years after a hazing video surfaced of pledges being confined in a plywood box, forced to eat vomit, and deprived of sleep, by other fraternity members. In November 2014, a \u0394\u039a\u0395 colony in Edinburgh , since closed, had the minutes leaked from a meeting in March 2014 by the University of Edinburgh student newspaper, The Student . The minutes allegedly referred to comments that joked about rape, sexual harassment, transphobia and hazing. The story gained traction in both national and international media, being picked up by The Independent , The Huffington Post , and Time magazine . In 2018, after Christine Blasey Ford accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, an old photograph surfaced showing two members of \u0394\u039a\u0395 marching across the Yale campus, one carrying a flag made from women's underwear. Kavanaugh, who is not in the photograph, was a member of the fraternity when the photograph was taken. One of the members told the student paper that the underwear was obtained consensually, but female classmates said their rooms were ransacked by \u0394\u039a\u0395 members while they were in class, saying they were \"loud, entitled, pushy and creepy\". See also List of social fraternities Footnotes ^ Franklin D. Roosevelt was a member of the Alpha chapter of DKE at Harvard and would be considered the sixth DKE brother to serve as President of the United States; however, the Harvard chapter was de-recognized by DKE International due to the chapter's stance on dual membership with other fraternities.

The bridge crosses the river in Buchanan County , between Marion Township on the east, and Washington Township on the west. Confederate partisans planned to burn the lower timbers of the 160-foot (49\u00a0m) bridge across the river, leaving the top looking intact. At 11:15\u00a0p.m. on a moonless night, the westbound passenger train from Hannibal, Missouri , to St. Joseph started to cross the bridge. The supports cracked and gave way. The locomotive flipped, falling 30 feet (9.1\u00a0m) into the shallow river and bringing with it the freight cars, baggage car , mail car and two passenger cars with 100 men, women and children. Bodies and the injured were taken to the Patee House near the St. Joseph depot. Union soldiers were ordered to track down and execute bushwhackers for their part in the incident. Barclay Coppock Confederate Major General Sterling Price , who had been invading northern Missouri at the time, wrote Union commanding general Henry Wager Halleck to protest, stating the sabotage was \"lawful and proper\" according to the rules of warfare and that the captured men should be treated as prisoners of war. Halleck replied that the bushwhackers were \"spies, marauders, robbers, incendiaries, guerrilla bands...in the garb of peaceful citizens\". The bushwhackers were also to say that the train was a military target because there were soldiers on it bound for Fort Leavenworth, Kansas . One of the soldiers killed was Barclay Coppock , a member of John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry. The bushwackers were also to claim that it was an attempt to assassinate former Missouri Governor Robert Marcellus Stewart . The most prominent of the bushwhackers sought by the Federal troops was Silas M. Gordon . Union troops were to burn Platte City, Missouri twice (in December 1861 and July 1864) in unsuccessful attempts to force the townspeople to surrender him (see the Burning of Platte City ). The railroad at the time was the first to cross the state of Missouri and it was used to deliver mail to and from the Pony Express terminus in St. Joseph, Missouri. Col. Ulysses S. Grant 's first commission in the Civil War had been guarding the trains. In August he was promoted to brigadier general on a new assignment. References Filbert, Preston.

{"id": "doc_random_191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81lvaro_Cervera", "text": "In this Spanish name , the first or paternal surname is Cervera and the second or maternal family name is D\u00edaz . \u00c1lvaro Cervera D\u00edaz (born 20 September 1965) is a Spanish football coach and former player who is the manager of Primera Federaci\u00f3n club Tenerife . A winger , he played 261 matches in La Liga over 12 seasons for Racing de Santander (in two spells), Mallorca and Valencia , scoring 17 goals. He won four caps for Spain in the 1990s. Cervera became a coach in 2002, going on to work with a number of clubs. Playing career Club Born in Santa Isabel , Spanish Guinea when both his parents worked in that country, Cervera was raised in Santa Cruz de Tenerife and played youth football for four clubs, finishing his development at Racing de Santander . He made his La Liga debut on 9 September 1984 by playing the full 90 minutes in a 1\u20130 away loss against Real Valladolid , but only totalled seven games in his first two senior seasons, featuring much more regularly in 1986\u201387 but suffering relegation . In the summer of 1987, \u00c1lvaro \u2013 known by his first name during his playing days \u2013 signed for RCD Mallorca , remaining five years with them and being relegated twice from the top flight. In the 1988\u201389 campaign he scored a career-best six goals in 35 matches, helping the Balearic Islands team to promote from Segunda Divisi\u00f3n . \u00c1lvaro moved to Valencia CF in June 1992, following Mallorca's relegation . He made 32 appearances and netted three times in his first year (notably once in a 4\u20131 away victory over Athletic Bilbao ), but was more often than not a reserve from there onwards, for that and his following club Racing, which he left to play with H\u00e9rcules CF in the second division. \u00c1lvaro retired in 2001 at the age of nearly 36, following a spell in the lower leagues. International \u00c1lvaro earned four caps for Spain , in slightly more than one year. He made his debut on 4 September 1991, coming on as a 76th-minute substitute for Andoni Goikoetxea in a 2\u20131 friendly win against Uruguay in Oviedo . Coaching career Cervera took up coaching in 2001, working with amateurs Catarroja CF in several capacities. From 2004 to 2011 he managed almost exclusively in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B , and his first job at the professional level arrived in 2011\u201312 when he was appointed at Recreativo de Huelva in division two. However, in March 2012, he arranged to have his contract terminated when he received an offer from former side Racing Santander in the top tier, but he only collected three draws in his 13 games in charge to become the competition's worst ever debutant, and was not renewed. On 3 July 2012, Cervera signed with Tenerife where he had already played youth football more than 30 years ago. Shortly before achieving promotion to the second division in his debut season , he renewed his link until 2015, being however relieved of his duties on 2 February 2015 even though he had a contract running until 2018. On 18 April 2016, Cervera replaced Claudio Barrag\u00e1n at the helm of C\u00e1diz CF , and managed to achieve promotion to the second tier at the end of the campaign . After coming fifth the following season , the team qualified for the play-offs for top-flight promotion, losing on regulations after a 1\u20131 semi-final draw with CD Tenerife in June 2017; promotion was finally gained in July 2020 , ending a 14-year exile. A quote from Cervera, \"La lucha no se negocia\" (\"The fight is non-negotiable\" in Spanish), was adopted by C\u00e1diz as a club catchphrase shortly after his arrival. On 11 January 2022, as the club was in the relegation zone , he was sacked. On 18 October 2022, Cervera replaced Bolo at Real Oviedo . He was dismissed on 21 September of the following year, after the start of the new season saw the side placed second-bottom. Cervera returned to Tenerife on 23 December 2024, as their third manager of the second-division campaign .

{"id": "doc_random_192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_flight", "text": "Soul flight is a technique of ecstasy used by shamans with the aim of entering into a state of trance . During such ecstatic trance it is believed that the shaman's soul has left the body and the corporeal world (compare out-of-body experience ) which allows him or her to enter a spiritual world and interact with its denizens. Believing themselves to be travelling into other realms, shamans either descend into an underworld (cf. katabasis or nekyia ) or ascend unto an upper world (cf. anabasis ) - usually by means of an axis mundi (sometimes actually depicted in concrete form in the accompanying ritual) - and indeed they can, in a sense, be said to be flying through such divine or infernal realms. By means of such trance states, shamans profess to provide services for their fellow tribespeople and one of the techniques they employ in order to achieve such ASCs is soul flight. They alter their consciousness to connect with the spirit world, which is considered to be the source of their knowledge and power. Among the many services that practitioners believe may be rendered by means of soul flight are: healing, divination , protection, clairvoyance , dream interpretation , mediation between the human and the divine, communicating with spirits of the dead ( s\u00e9ance ), and escorting deceased souls to the afterlife ( psychopomp ). Soul flight, also known as shamanic journeying or magical flight , has been exercised from paleolithic times to the present day. With the passing of time this shamanic practice has evolved into a way for the individual to transcend themselves . Theoretical background Hamatsa Shaman seated on the ground in front of a tree, facing front, possessed by supernatural power after having spent several days in the woods as part of an initiation ritual In 1951, Mircea Eliade 's historical study of different manifestations of shamanism across the globe, titled Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy , was published in France. He pointed out that shamanism was not just practiced in Siberia and Eurasia , but could be found in cultures all across the world. According to Eliade, the core principle of shamanism is the application of techniques of ecstasy which enable people to interact with the spiritual world on behalf of the community. There are three ways of becoming a shaman: by spontaneous vocation (i.e. the \"call\" of \"election), by hereditary transmission, or by personal quest. A shaman is only recognized after he received two kinds of teaching: ecstatic (e.g. dreams , trances, visions ) and traditional (e.g. shamanic techniques, names, and functions of the spirits, mythology, and genealogy of the clan, secret language). The former teaching is conveyed by the spirits while the latter lesson is given by the elder shamans. Together, both teachings constitute initiation . Selection for the role of a shaman may be derived from a crisis, an illness, or an episode of insanity; all of which are interpreted as experiencing personal death. This initiation crisis usually involves an experience of suffering which is followed by death and dismemberment (i.e. descent into the underworld), an ascent unto the upper world and interactions with other souls and spirits along these both ways (cf. dying-and-rising deity ). The cross-culturally recurrent mytheme of death-dismemberment-rebirth reflect the death of one identity and the birth of another one. Overcoming these experiences leads the shaman towards a new level of identity, and this transforming experience is symbolized as the flight of his or her soul. A shaman's soul-flying abilities presuppose a sacred cosmology , or a world-view that encompasses a sacred or ultimate reality that is structured in what has been called an archetypically, three-storied cosmology. It entails the earth in the middle or the everyday world of non-ordinary reality. The upper world is supposed to be the abode of benevolent spirits and heavenly scenes, while the underworld consists of ancestral and malignant spirits as well as dark and gloomy places. Historical overview The Stone Age Prior to the first agricultural revolution , when people still lived in hunter-gatherer societies, shamanism possibly emerged from a belief in the afterlife. Shamanism was practiced among nearly all documented hunter-gatherers, and it has often been proposed by anthropologists to be the world's oldest profession. By visibly transforming during initiation and trance, the shaman attempts to convince tribal members that he or she can interact with invisible forces that control uncertain outcomes. By doing so, the shaman acts like he or she can influence unpredictable, important events. The transformative display of the shaman during trance is thought to be essential because it serves as evidence of spiritual communication for those who behold his or her ritual, which then contributes to the credibility of the shaman. The Bronze Age After gradually switching towards an agrarian society , humans settled down and civilization emerged. During the Bronze Age , it is thought that people experienced themselves in what has been called a \"continuous cosmos\", wherein a sense of deep connectedness existed between the natural plus socio-cultural world and the worlds of the Gods (above and below). In such a world, time moves in cycles that repeat itself throughout eternity. In a continuous cosmos, people defined themselves in terms of fitting into and being in harmony with, these cycles. Back then, wisdom is thought to be power-oriented: to become a wise Bronze Age man or woman meant to learn how to acquire and hold on to power. For example, the Pharaoh was thought of as godlike, and this was not a metaphor for the Ancient Egyptians . The difference between human beings and the Gods was essentially differences in power. Facsimile of a vignette from the Book of the Dead . The ba of the deceased Theban scribe Ani hovers over his mummy as it lies on a bier The Ancient Egyptians believed that an individual was made up of many parts, some physical and others spiritual. Their concept of the soul postulated several components, one of which \u2013 the Ba - corresponds with what in Western thought is called the soul, although the two concepts are not easily commensurable. In the Egyptian Book of the Dead , the Ba is depicted as a bird with the head of a human, symbolizing both its human nature and its mobility. It was believed that the Ba lived on after the body had died, and flew out of the tomb of his or her owner to join with the Ka (\"life force\", cf. \u00e9lan vital ) in the afterlife, and it was conceivable that the Ba could also be released during sleep . Later, Coptic texts adopted the Greek word Psyche instead of the native Bai as the term for soul, which demonstrates a link between the earlier concept of the Ba and the Christian interpretation of the soul. Classical Antiquity The worldview of a continuous cosmos is shattered during the Axial Age , although it does not vanish completely. Charles Taylor dubbed this transition \"the Great Disembedding\": the world as a continuous cosmos, in a mythological sense, was broadly replaced by a different worldview on understanding the relationship between the self and the world. This new worldview uses the mythology of two worlds, namely \"the everyday world\" and \"the real world\". The everyday world is populated with untrained minds and riddled with self-deception, violence, and chaos. In contrast, in the real world you are in touch with reality, wherein wise minds can see the world without illusion and delusion. During the Axial Age, the practice of soul flight was exapted by ancient philosophers, meaning that it came to be used as a means of transcending the self from the everyday world towards the real world. Meaning is not based on the connectedness with the eternal cycles anymore; its focus has shifted towards a connectedness with the real world. As such, there was a radical change in how people defined themselves and the world around them, as people increasingly defined themselves by how they can self-transcend, or how they can grow as an individual. Wisdom changed from being solely focused on power towards a focus on this quest for self-transcendence. Orphism Orpheus and Eurydice (Dutch School, 17th Century, artist unknown) Orpheus , the legendary musician and prophet from Greek mythology , was believed to have descended into Hades to recover his lost wife Eurydice . Alas to no avail, but, allegedly, he lived to tell his tale as he did return to back the earthly world. Orpheus was seen as the founder and prophet of the Orphic Mysteries , possibly the successor of the more ancient Dionysian Mysteries . According to the Orphics, the soul is godlike in its essential nature but, due to some primordial sin, it descended to earth where it lives in a succession of bodies, human or otherwise. The soul of man is divine and immortal and it seeks to return to its essential nature, but the body holds it in its captivity. At the moment of bodily death, the soul is liberated for a short time before it is again taken captive in a different body. As such, the soul journeys between the natural world and the spiritual world from one generation to the next (cf. reincarnation ). To escape this so-called \"circle of necessity\", or \"wheel of birth\", an act of divine grace is required. The more virtuous one lives her or his life, the higher will be their next reincarnation until the soul ascends as high as from which it came (cf. Metempsychosis ). Pythagoreanism The Pythagoreans adopted many of the Orphic teachings into their own philosophical tradition, in which great emphasis was also laid on the purification of the soul. According to Proclus , Pythagoras learned Orphic beliefs and practices when he completed initiation in Thrace . Pythagoras is considered by some scholars to be a reformer of Orphism, just as Orpheus was a reformer of the Dionysian Mysteries. As such, he was in part responsible for introducing the mystical element into Ancient Greek philosophy . It is plausible that Pythagoras was initiated into shamanic training through something which was called the \"Thunderstone ceremony\", which involved isolating oneself in a cave and going through some sort of radical transformation before coming back out of it. Pythagoras also seems to have experienced soul flight, when he spoke about the ability of the psyche to be liberated from the body. By using music and mathematics, he realized there are abstract patterns that lie beyond our direct awareness, but that we can get access to nonetheless. Self-transcendence, in this case, means getting in touch with these rationally realized patterns. Although we are trapped inside the everyday world we can, in a mythological sense, learn to fly above this world and see the real world. Here, myths refer to symbolic stories about those patterns that have always been with us. Plotinus In Plotinus ' treatise on the nature of beauty, the beauty of the soul consists in the emancipation from the passions . The neoplatonic philosopher argued that those who have the strength should turn away from material beauty, forego all that is known by the eyes, and search for their soul's beauty within themselves. We should aspire to behold the vision of our inner beauty, so our soul can first become virtuous and beautiful and, eventually, divine. Plotinus further asked in what manner, or by what device, one may achieve such an inner vision. Referring to a passage from Homer's Odyssey (\"Let us flee, then, to our beloved homeland\" ), Plotinus inquires into the manner of this flight: \"This is not a journey for the feet; the feet bring us only from land to land; nor need you think of coach or ship to carry you away; all this order of things you must set aside and refuse to see: you must close the eyes and call instead upon another vision which is to be waked within you, a vision, the birthright of all, which few turn to use\". The Middle Ages With its establishment as the dominant religion in Europe, Christianity and its doctrines became of the utmost importance in the Middle Ages . A passage in the eighth book of the Confessions , Saint Augustine discusses the flight of the soul in a way that resembles Plotinus' treatise. Both concur that one must dispense with ordinary modes of perception to experience soul flight. Saint Augustine interprets the soul's flight as one's way of reaching wisdom which is the way directed towards the light; we have to flee from sensible things and have need of wings to fly towards that light, out of the darkness in which we live. But where the problem for Plotinus is one of seeing, St. Augustine emphasizes the importance of the will, and he replaces feeling good or beautiful with willing it. His conceptualization of soul flight became, especially in his later works, thus more concerned with one's willingness to make the journey towards Heaven . The opposite direction is taken in the Apocalypse of Peter , which describes Christ's three days' descent into Hell . Another example of this kind of Christian katabasis is the Harrowing of Hell , which also chronicles the period between Jesus' Crucifixion and his Resurrection . These are one of the earliest examples of explicit depictions of heaven and hell, a theme that would inspire many more writers and artists in days to come. The Imitation of Christ , which is the practice of following the example of Jesus, is considered to be the fundamental purpose of Christian life by Saint Augustine. In the words of Francis of Assisi , poverty is the key element of following the example of Jesus and he believed in the physical as well as the spiritual imitation of Christ. His physical imitation was achieved when Saint Francis received stigmata in 1224 A.D. , during the apparition of a Seraph in a state of religious ecstasy . In the early 15th century, Thomas \u00e0 Kempis wrote the Imitation of Christ , which provides specific instructions for imitating Christ. His devotional approach is characterized by its emphasis on the interior life as well as the withdrawal from this world, thus it is most concerned with the spiritual imitation of Christ. Dante Sandro Botticelli 's Chart of Hell Dante 's Divine Comedy , one of the most celebrated works in Western literature , narrates the journey of the soul after death. It chronicles Dante's own descent into Hell, his wanderings in Purgatory , and finally, his soul's ascent to Heaven. In accordance with the medieval world-view of 14th century Europe, the poet envisions a rich afterlife where he, accompanied by one of three guides, visits many mysterious places and encounters numerous souls, spirits, and shadows. In an allegorical sense, the poem represents the soul's flight from Lucifer in Hell towards God in Heaven. With regard to the Commedia, Carl Jung argued: \"The compelling power and deeper meaning of the work do[es] not lie in the historical and mythical material, but in the visionary experience it serves to express\". Meister Eckhart Around the same time when Dante was compiling his Commedia, Meister Eckhart commented the following on where one must look to find spiritual salvation : \"[To] grasp all things in a divine way and make of them something more than they are in themselves. (...) This cannot be learned by taking flight, that is by fleeing from things and physically withdrawing to a place of solitude, but rather we must learn to maintain inner solitude regardless of where we are or who we are with. We must learn to break through things and to grasp God in them, allowing him to take form in us powerfully and essentially\". According to Meister Eckhardt the way toward the soul lies inwards, as he writes: \"Therefore do I turn back once more to myself, there do I find the deepest places, deeper than Hell itself; for even from there does my wretchedness drive me. Nowhere can I escape myself! Here I will set me down and here I will remain\". The Modern Age During the Renaissance , Europeans refocused their attention on the ideas and achievements of classical antiquity , which became particularly manifested in art, architecture, politics, science, and literature. The invention of the printing press instigated a new age of mass communication , with the result that the flow of ideas between people reached unprecedented levels of speed and range. This permanently altered the structure of society exemplified, among other things, by a sharp increase in literacy and the emergence of the middle class. Certain authors began to use writing as a means to express their visionary experiences, a practice which became more widespread from the Middle Ages onwards. Milton In 17th century Britain , during a time of religious and political turmoil, John Milton wrote Paradise Lost . The epic poem , written in blank verse , starts in medias res with Satan 's rebellion against God, seen through the eyes of Satan himself. It continues with Satan's fall from Heaven , the arrival of the serpent in Eden , and eventually, the story of Adam and Eve . The overall theme of Milton's masterpiece addresses the battle between God and Satan, fought across three worlds (i.e. Heaven, Earth, and Hell), for control over the human soul. Swedenborg In the 1740s, Emanuel Swedenborg began to experience strange dreams and visions which he documented in his travelogue . These experiences culminated in a spiritual awakening , in which he received a revelation from Jesus. Because God had opened his spiritual eyes, Swedenborg felt he could visit heaven and hell to communicate with angels , demons , and other spirits. In arguably his most famous work, Heaven and Hell , he gives a detailed description of the afterlife and explains how souls live on after the physical death of one's body. According to Swedenborg, instead of one hell that is similar for everybody, there are an infinite variety and diversity of Heavens and Hells. His writings gave rise to a new religious movement known as the New Church , which promoted one universal church based on love and charity . Blake Between 1790 and 1793, while the Revolution was gaining momentum in France, William Blake composed a book in a similar literary tradition about the visionary's practice of soul flight. Like Dante in his Commedia and Milton in his Paradise lost, the poet visits Hell and Heaven where he meets and speaks with angels and demons. The book was written in prose, except for the introductory \" Argument \" and the \"Song of Liberty\", and accompanied by paintings of his own dreams and visions. With satirical reference to Swedenborg's Heaven and Hell, he titled this book the Marriage of Heaven and Hell . Although Blake was greatly influenced by Swedenborg's mystical conception of a sacred cosmology, he was opposed to Swedenborg's dualistic interpretation of good and evil . As such, he deliberately presented a more unified vision of the cosmos wherein the upper world and the underworld are both parts of the same divine order; i.e. the marriage of Heaven and Hell. Carl Jung The Red Book resting on Jung 's office desk From 1913 until 1930, Carl Jung carried out a self-experiment that became known as his confrontation with the unconscious . He first recorded his inner experiences (dreams, visions, fantasies) in the Black Books , which are basically the records of this self-experiment. These records were revised by Jung, and reflections were added. He then copied these revisions and reflections in a calligraphic script and, accompanied by his own paintings (not unlike Blake in his prophetic books ), put it together into a book bound in red leather entitled Liber Novus (\"New Book\") . The Red Book , as it is popularly known, was published in October 2009 and it chronicles Jung's struggle to regain his soul and overcome the contemporary malaise of spiritual alienation. Within the same context of the visionary tradition in Western literature of some of the aforementioned authors, Jung argued that before you can find the way toward spiritual fulfillment you first must descend into your own Hell. In the Red book, Jung comments the following on Jesus' descent into Hell: \"No one knows what happened during the three days Christ was in Hell. I have experienced it. The men of yore said he had preached to the deceased. What they say is true, but do you know how this happened? It was folly and monkey business, an atrocious Hell's masquerade of the holiest mysteries. How else could Christ have saved his Antichrist? Read the unknown books of the ancients, and you will learn much from them. Notice that Christ did not remain in Hell, but rose to the heights in the beyond\". On the dynamic relationship between Heaven and Hell, Jung concludes: \"But the deepest Hell is when you realize that Hell is also no Hell, but a cheerful Heaven, not a Heaven in itself, but in this respect a Heaven, and in that respect a Hell\" See also Afterlife Altered state of consciousness Body of light Christian mysticism Dreams Ecstasy Imagination Mystery religions Mysticism Numinous Religious ecstasy Religious experience Self-transcendence Shamanism Soul Spiritualism Spiritual practice Trance Vision (spirituality) Images Reconstruction of Nekyia by Polygnotus Tiresias appears to Ulysses during the sacrifice, by Henry Fuseli The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch .

She has also been involved in numerous Drag Race spin-offs, including RuPaul's Drag Race: Vegas Revue (2020) and RuPaul's Secret Celebrity Drag Race (2022). She also competed in the first Canadian-based international All Stars spin-off series, Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World in 2022, finishing as a runner-up. Early life and education Silky Nutmeg Ganache was born on December 31, 1990, into an African American Pentecostal family in Moss Point, Mississippi , but eventually moved to Chicago as a young adult. Growing up, she was an avid fan of the Food Network , and most frequently watched Emeril Lagasse \u2019s programs. She is a Hurricane Katrina survivor, and, as a result of the flooding sustained during the natural disaster, only a few visual records of her childhood exist. She came out to her family as gay when she was in her senior year of high school. She earned her MBA in organizational leadership from Indiana Wesleyan University in December 2017. According to Silky Nutmeg Ganache's website, she is currently pursuing her PhD . Because of her Master's and PhD pursuit, she is often jokingly referred to as \"The Reverend Dr. Silky Nutmeg Ganache\". She went to Wabash College , an all-male college, where she came out as gay to her college community during her junior year of college, and she thought of her original drag name, \"Lasagna Frozeen\", which was considered alongside the name \"Honeybutta Biscuit Superbottom\". The name \"Lasagna Frozeen\" originated from when Silky Nutmeg Ganache drank too much at parties and her peers gave her the nickname \"Lasagna\", quipping that \"Lasagna was coming out\" whenever she had drunk too much alcohol. She had first discovered drag during her senior year of college, when, over spring break, she attended a drag show at nearby DePauw University . Her drag mother and mentor, Vanessa Ryan, later dubbed her \"Silky\" because she could be rough around the edges but also classy. One night, Silky went home where she watched the Food Network , and, while watching a program, she overheard the phrase \"silky ganache .\" She added \u201cnutmeg\u201d, a nickname she had gained while working in food services to the name, and, from there, she would hence be known as \"Silky Nutmeg Ganache\". She considers the anniversary of her first time performing in drag to be March 18, 2012. Silky Nutmeg Ganache graduated from Wabash College the same year. Career Silky Nutmeg Ganache has participated in many pageants, and has over 100 competition credits.

In the Drag Race episode \" Trump: The Rusical \", she explained that this is because of party gerrymandering and \"gentrification and movement of the districts\", and stated that despite her official party affiliation, she does not vote for Republican politicians. She says \"It's very important that people realize that if you want to stop that within the political process, get smarter than them. Register as a Republican, and they'll have to redo everything.\" After her run on Drag Race , Silky Nutmeg Ganache later revealed that due to the online hate and abuse she received, she fell into a depression and nearly quit drag.

{"id": "doc_random_194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_Txapote_vote_for_you", "text": "\" Let Txapote vote for you \" ( Spanish : \u00a1Que te vote Txapote! ; full version: \u00a1Que te vote Txapote, S\u00e1nchez! , \"Let Txapote vote for you, S\u00e1nchez!\") is a political slogan that is popular among the political right and far-right in Spain during the months prior to the 2023 general elections . It is commonly used against Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez and mentions the ETA terrorist Francisco Javier Garc\u00eda Gaztelu (nicknamed \"Txapote\"). Political context After the general elections of November 2019 and the start of the 14th legislature , acting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez ( PSOE ) required the abstention of the leading political parties of the nationalist left, the Catalan ERC and Basque EH Bildu , in order to form his second government during the January 2020 parliamentary session. This gesture, among other minor arrangements with EH Bildu, was a central element of criticism by the Spanish political right (mainly the People's Party and Vox ). Francisco Javier Garc\u00eda Gaztelu , nicknamed \"Txapote\", was one of the main leaders of the Basque terrorist group ETA. He has been in prison since 2005 after being accused of committing more than a dozen murders, including those of Miguel \u00c1ngel Blanco , Gregorio Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez , and Fernando Buesa . Origin of phrase Although it does not have a fully identified origin, its first media appearance dates from September 3, 2022, when, in a meeting between Pedro S\u00e1nchez and the public in Seville , an anonymous member of Solidaridad (a local Union tied to the Vox party), raised a banner at the meeting that read Que te vote Txapote (\"Let Txapote vote for you\"). Days later, Jorge Buxad\u00e9 , vice president of Vox, used the phrase in a press conference. The slogan would reach its media zenith on January 25, 2023, when the Hablando Claro television program was broadcasting live from Cazalegas (near Toledo ). The topic to be discussed was the presence of a private traffic radar used by the city council, for which reason a \"victim\" of the radar was going to be interviewed. The interviewee was Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \"Chema\" de la Cierva, a photographer linked to the extreme right, son of the historian and Su\u00e1rez minister Ricardo de la Cierva . Chema blurted out: \"Let Txapote vote for you, S\u00e1nchez, let Txapote vote for you.\" and continued \" The media at the service of the people! Let Chapote vote for you, S\u00e1nchez. Socialist, son of a bitch, mass murderer, fuck you! Fuck everyone, socialists, red shit, fuck you! \" After this, the signal was cut and returned to the set, and presenter Lourdes Maldonado . Rally of Santiago Abascal , leader of Vox, in Murcia , where a supporter carries a sign with the slogan \"Let Txapote vote for you Sanchez\" De la Cierva was recording what happened with his mobile phone and later published the video, appearing after the broadcast was cut off to launch a series of insults and death threats at the Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola team. The scene quickly became an internet phenomenon, especially on Twitter . The Vox communication team tried to sign Chema de la Cierva for the electoral campaign of the local and regional elections to be held the following May, but the contract was not finalized. On February 2, 2023, in a plenary session of the Madrid Assembly , the president of the Community of Madrid Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso (PP) used the slogan in a parliamentary intervention addressed to the PSOE. Consuelo Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, sister of politician Gregorio Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez assassinated by Txapote in 1993, condemned Diaz Ayuso's use of the slogan. The use of the phrase would grow throughout the campaign for the municipal and regional elections. The day of the election, during an interview with the media, Pedro S\u00e1nchez was heckled at the gates of his polling station. 2023 General election campaign The usage of the slogan increased during the pre-campaign and campaign for the general elections of July 23, 2023. It would come from positions close to the two main political parties of the Spanish right (PP and Vox) or directly from them. During the celebration of the Sanfermines in Pamplona at the beginning of July, the live broadcast of Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola was interrupted on numerous occasions with the cry of \"Let Txapote vote for you, S\u00e1nchez\". On July 10 in the debate organized by Atresmedia that pitted S\u00e1nchez against PP president Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o , S\u00e1nchez asked Feij\u00f3o if he condemned the use of the slogan. Feij\u00f3o did not give a clear answer, leading Basque parties to refuse to negotiate potential support for his bid for the prime ministership. As its use increased, the first criticisms also appeared. On July 11, 2023, the Collective of Victims of Terrorism , the Fernando Buesa Foundation, and several independent victims asked not to use the slogan as they considered it \"a trivialization of terrorism and terrorists\". The use of the slogan, however, divided the victims of terrorism, with Mar\u00eda del Mar Blanco , sister of Txapote's victim Miguel \u00c1ngel Blanco, and many others openly supporting its use. Most of the Spanish political spectrum ended up taking position over the phrase. Borja S\u00e9mper , spokesman for the Popular Party, acknowledged that the expression caused him discomfort. The Basque Nationalist Party , through Aitor Esteban , criticized the use of the slogan as \"hurtful\", but said that it was just as hurtful that EH Bildu was fielding convicted ETA members in its lists. The head of the EH Bildu list for Guip\u00fazcoa , Mertxe Aizpurua , described the use of the slogan as \"undignified\". On July 20, 2023, the Central Electoral Board stated that according to Article 93 of the Organic Law of the General Electoral Regime, wearing T-shirts bearing this slogan on election day would be considered electoral propaganda and was therefore forbidden. The information was a response to a query made from Ja\u00e9n due to a campaign on social networks encouraging voters to go to the polling stations wearing T-shirts screen-printed with the slogan alongside the Spanish coat of arms .

{"id": "doc_random_195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Gambit,_McDonnell_Gambit", "text": "The McDonnell Gambit is a chess opening gambit in the King's Gambit , Classical Variation , that begins with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. Nc3 It can also be reached via the Quaade Gambit : 4. Nc3 g4 5. Bc4 The opening is named after Alexander McDonnell , a 19th-century Irish chess master, who successfully introduced it in his third match with Louis-Charles Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais . The aim is to gain a significant lead in development ( knight , bishop , and queen ) for the sacrificed knight, followed by a kingside attack. The McDonnell Gambit has always been much less popular for White than the similarly motivated Muzio Gambit (4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0). Although considered obsolete by MCO , it has not been refuted. It should not be confused with the McDonnell Attack , found in the Bishop's Gambit (3.Bc4). This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves. 5...gxf3 After 5... gxf3 6. Qxf3 is usual, though the wild 6.0-0 is occasionally seen. Now 6...Bh6 (as in the McDonnell\u2013La Bourdonnais game below) is regarded as inferior. Better options for Black are: 6... d5 7.Nxd5 Nc6 led to approximate equality in Charousek & Fahndrich \u2013 Halprin & Marco, Vienna 1897 after 8.0-0 Bd6 9.d4 Nxd5 10.Qh5 Be6 11.Bxf4 Bxf4 12.Nxf4 Bxc4 13.Qe5+ Kf8 14.Qxh8 Bxf1 15.Rxf1 Qf6 16.Qxh7 Qxf4. 6... d6 7.0-0 Be6 8.Nd5 c6 9.Qc3 cxd5 10.Qxh8 dxc4 11.Qxg8 Qb6+ 12.Kh1 Nc6 13.b3 Qd4 and Black is better (analysis by J.

Continuing his policy of development over material . 8... Nxd4 ? 9. Bxf7+! Position after 9.Bxf7! A frequently seen move in the King's Gambit as it strips away a key defensive pawn. 9... Kxf7 10. Qh5+ Kg7 11. Bxf4 Bxf4 12. Rxf4 Nf6 13. Qg5+ Kf7 14. Raf1 Position after 14.Raf1 McDonnell has built up a winning attack almost effortlessly. 14... Ke8 15.

Qc5 One last try; if McDonnell is inattentive he could miss the discovered check 17...Nf3+! followed by 18...Nxg5 when suddenly he has a lost position. 17. Kh1! Ne6 Position after 17...Ne6 18.

{"id": "doc_random_196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Clemson_Tigers_football_team", "text": "The 2020 Clemson Tigers football team represented Clemson University during the 2020 NCAA Division I FBS football season . The Tigers were led by head coach Dabo Swinney , in his 12th full year. The Tigers competed as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and played their home games at Memorial Stadium in Clemson, South Carolina . The season was played amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic . The ACC settled on an eleven-game football schedule, with ten conference games with no divisions and one non-conference game. Clemson canceled their previously scheduled non-conference games against Akron and South Carolina , and kept their game against The Citadel . Precautions were taken to reduce the spread of the virus, including testing, isolation requirements, and limitations on the number of fans in attendance. Clemson began the year ranked first in the preseason AP Poll , and handily won their first seven games of the season, including a 42\u201317 win over then-No. 9 Miami (FL) . Starting quarterback Trevor Lawrence tested positive for COVID-19 on October 29, and was forced to miss the team's next two games against Boston College and temporary ACC member Notre Dame . The team escaped with a close win against Boston College, but lost on the road to then-No. 4 Notre Dame in double overtime, 47\u201340. Clemson won the remainder of their regular season games, and earned a place in the ACC Championship Game by finishing second in the division-less format with an 8\u20131 record, behind Notre Dame. In the rematch against the Fighting Irish, this time with Lawrence at quarterback, the Tigers were victorious by a score of 34\u201310, to win their sixth consecutive ACC title. In the final College Football Playoff rankings of the season, Clemson was ranked second, earning them a place in the national semifinal to be played at the Sugar Bowl against third-seeded Ohio State , a rematch of the previous season's Fiesta Bowl . Clemson lost the rematch, 49\u201328, to end the season at 10\u20132 and ranked third in the final polls. Junior quarterback Trevor Lawrence led the team on offense with 3,153 passing yards and 24 passing touchdowns. He was named ACC Player of the Year and finished second in voting for the Heisman Trophy . The team's leading rusher was Travis Etienne , who was named a consensus All-American all-purpose back. Amari Rodgers was the team's leading receiver and was named first-team all-conference. On defense, the team featured two first-team all-conference members in lineman Bryan Bresee and cornerback Derion Kendrick . Bresee was named the ACC Defensive Freshman of the Year. Offseason Recruiting Main article: 2020 college football recruiting class Clemson's 2020 recruiting class consisted of 23 signees. The class was ranked as the best class in the ACC and the third best class overall according to the 247Sports Composite. Offseason departures NFL draftees Undrafted free agents Transfers Preseason Award watch lists Listed in the order that they were released Schedule Clemson had games scheduled against Akron and South Carolina , which were both canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic . This was the first season since 1908 that the Tigers did not play South Carolina. The ACC released their schedule format on July 29, with specific dates selected at a later date. Specific game dates were released on August 6, 2020. Florida State cancelled their scheduled game with Clemson the morning of the game after Clemson had already traveled to Florida State's campus.

{"id": "doc_random_198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Culture_Forum", "text": "The Oxcars The Free Culture Forum (FCForum) was an international meeting of relevant organisations and individuals involved in free culture , digital rights and access to knowledge. It took place in Barcelona every year from 2009 to 2015, jointly with the oXcars, a free culture festival. The oXcars (or OXcars ) are a non-competitive awards ceremony held at Sala Apolo in Barcelona , Spain , in October each year. They are a public showcase that puts the spotlight on cultural creation and distribution carried out under the paradigms of shared culture. Through presentations and symbolic mentions of works in a series of categories, real legal situations involving free culture are shown using parody. Award ceremonies The Oxcars are an awards ceremony organised by Xnet (previously eXgae, until November 2010), a non-profit organisation that explores alternative models for cultural diffusion and royalties management. In 2008 and 2009 the oXcars were organised with the collaboration of Conservas, and in 2010 with Conservas, Red Sostenible and Telenoika. The awards ceremony is an overview of outstanding projects in the field of free/libre culture and knowledge, with live music, videos, brief presentations, performances and readings. Since 2009, the ceremonies have coincided with the FCForum, an international conference in which organisations and experts in free/libre culture and knowledge gather to devise a global strategic framework and an international framework for coordination. Categories The award categories include: Music Film Dance Theatre Animation Literature Millions of Visits in Your Bedroom Great Human Tools Future Markets Culture existed before the Cultural Industry Great Leftovers of Spanish Culture History 2008 Oxcars The participants of the first Oxcars, on October 28, 2008, were Leo Bassi, The Pirate Bay , literary collective Wu Ming , filmmaker Guillermo Zapata (director of the short film Lo que t\u00fa quieras o\u00edr ), Pablo Soto (developer of the Manolito P2P software), Platoniq, Alan Toner, FreeCinema, Griffi from S\u00f3lo los Solo, Molleindustria (with the video game Free Culture Game), Enrique Sierra from 127.es, the Blender Foundation with the 3D short film Big Buck Bunny , Realidades Avanzadas and Matt Black ( Coldcut ). The evening was rounded off with live sets by K-Sero+Off://TV , Filastine and La M\u00e0quina de Turing. Related activities A series of activities related to free/libre culture were organised on October 29 and November 1, in conjunction with the 2008 oXcars. They included talks, debates, round table discussions and practical workshops on licences, examples of free culture, anonymity and cryptography on the net, production and royalties management for audiovisual projects, and Safe Creative, a service that allows users to register works with any type of licence at no cost. Activities also included the launch of the book New Thing by Wu Ming and a screening of the film Steal this film, part 2 . FCForum 2009 The main objectives of the Free Culture Forum 2009 (from October 30 to November 1) were, on the one hand, building networks to optimise the efforts of the different groups and setting common demands against the proposals from industry and governments in their eagerness to control culture and information; and on the other hand reinforcing the self-organisation of tools and infrastructures to support free culture. The Free Knowledge Institute . The FCForum 2009 produced the Charter for Innovation, Creativity and Access to Knowledge. Official observers from the European Community's Commission for Culture and Education, the European Community 's Commission for Consumer Protection Government of Brazil ( were present. Charter for innovation, creativity and access to knowledge The Charter for innovation, creativity and access to knowledge contains suggested legal requirements, guidelines for education and access to knowledge, and structural requirements for a knowledge-based society. The guidelines were discussed by more than a hundred representatives at the forum. The Charter was used as an international reference during consultation with the Department of Digital Culture (Government of Brazil). It was used to negotiate sustainable laws with the Spanish Government, and the proposals were presented to the European Council during the Spanish Presidency of the European Union in 2010. Among the Charter's endorsers there are Jimmy Wales , Boaventura de Sousa Santos , Consumers International , Electronic Frontier Foundation , David Bollier , Students for Free Culture , European Digital Rights , Participatory Culture Foundation , La Quadrature du Net , Transnational Institute , Department of Digital Culture (Government of Brazil ), Pirat Partie, Creative Commons Espa\u00f1a, La-EX , and Networked Politics.

It resulted in a Declaration and How to Manual on sustainability of creativity in the digital era The FCForum declaration was signed by 80 organisations and individuals, including Richard Stallman . Sustainable models for creativity in the digital age In February 2011, two documents drafted by FCForum participants were released: Sustainable Models for Creativity and the How-To Manual for Sustainable creativity addressed at political reformers, citizens and free culture activists. Both documents are based on an understanding that current royalties management and cultural distribution systems have become obsolete in the digital age, and the conviction that free software and peer production and distribution is not incompatible with commercial distribution. The How-To Manual sets out a series of alternative commercial and non-profit models. It insists that the Internet must remain free and open in order to allow online collaboration models to develop, and it must be recognised as a tool that promotes contact between creators and the public. It offers an overview of new models that are already operating in a variety of fields, such as freemium , crowdfunding and micropayment systems in which users make small financial contributions to projects that are looking for seed funding through platforms such as Kickstarter and lanzanos.com or to existing initiatives that are given money depending on the number of users who vote for them. It also claims that the creators of commercial cooperative platforms should share their profits with the creators of the content they publish. 2010 Oxcars The participants of the 3rd Oxcars in 2010 were the writer Jos\u00e9 Luis Sampedro, The Pinker Tones , Kate Madison and Actors at Work Productions (creators of the film Born of Hope ), dance company Akram Khan , the writer Bel\u00e9n Gopegui , Miguel Brieva , Triolocr\u00eda, design studio Lava with their Free Magenta campaign (against the Deutsche Telekom patent on the colour magenta), gastronomic blogger Txaber Allu\u00e9 , hip-hop crew At Versaris, the Reactable (collaborative electronic music instrument), the free culture and copyleft festival Te Pica la Barba (with the animated short film Sopa , by Irene Iborra and Jossie Malis), Rojadirecta (a portal that offers sports broadcast through streaming or P2P applications), Koulomek, the Tweetpeli (a collaborative film made through Twitter), leerestademoda.com, Ploomba (a free piped music service), Jerzy Celichowski (from Blinken Open Society Archives ), European Digital Rights , Public Domain Day, La M\u00e1quina que gu\u00eda los rayos del sol (animations), Mart\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez (MotionGraphics) and Kevin Nicoll (illustration).

{"id": "doc_random_200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Africa_Conference_of_Churches", "text": "All Africa Conference of Churches ( AACC , Conf\u00e9rence des \u00c9glises de toute l'Afrique or CETA ) is an ecumenical fellowship that represents more than 200\u00a0million African Christians in 210 national churches and regional Christian councils in 43 African Countries. AACC's head office is in Nairobi , Kenya , and there is a regional office in Lom\u00e9 , Togo . AACC also has an office in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia which serves as its Liaison Office to the African Union. Its current General Secretary is the Rev. Dr. Fidon Mwombeki , Minister of the Lutheran Church in Tanzania . The Desmond Tutu Conference Centre in Nairobi is an affiliate of the AACC. History In 1958 the ecumenically dedicated Presbyterian Akanu Ibiam initiated a conference of Christian organisations and churches in Africa, which led to the foundation of AACC at its first assembly on 20 April 1963 in Kampala , Uganda . The theme of the first assembly was \u201cFreedom and Unity in Christ\u201d. The delegates addressed the colonial situation in the spirit of nationalism that permeated the political scene of the continent at the time. The delegates identified themselves with the aspirations of the peoples of the continent towards development of dignity and a mature personality in Christ and exhorted the churches \"to participate wholeheartedly in the building of the African nation\". The AACC has accompanied the churches in their engagement in the decolonization and nation-building processes. It played a significant role in the dismantling of apartheid in Southern Africa. The journey towards unity and freedom initiated at Kampala has continued through the following assemblies. Thus, the AACC continues to stand with the churches in addressing relevant issues that confront the continent, and to provide a platform of collective voices and collective action. Its foundational programmes are theology, mission and evangelism, ecumenical growth and interfaith relations. Core issues on its agenda include social and economic justice (overcoming poverty), health and wholeness ( HIV / AIDS ) and international relations (governance, ethics and morality). It is engaged in a thorough process of reconfiguring ecumenical relationships and cooperation in the continent, by integrating the churches, national councils, sub-regional fellowships and the continental body itself into a coherent network. AACC has celebrated its 50th anniversary with a Jubilee Assembly held from 3 to 9 June 2013, also in Kampala. Members AACC has 210 members in 43 African countries. The membership comprises Churches, National Christian Councils, Theological and Lay Training Institutions, and other Christian organisations. For operational and administrative reasons AACC has divided the continent into five sub-regions: Northern Africa (5 countries), Eastern Africa and Indian Ocean (7 countries), Southern Africa (10 countries), Central Africa (8 countries) and Western Africa (10 countries). This division ensures that every region is adequately represented in AACC's decision-making bodies. It also enables the AACC to have a better understanding of specific social economic and political issues facing the regions and thus be able to serve them better. References ^ \"AACC-CETA.

Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship , instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason\u2014the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll . The Coaches' Poll began operation in 1950; in addition, the AP Poll did not begin conducting preseason polls until that same year. Legend AP Poll The final AP Poll was released on December 4, at the end of the 1944 regular season , weeks before the major bowls. The AP would not release a post-bowl season final poll regularly until 1968 .

She is an expert on political behavior, social psychology, and cognitive neurosciences. She researches the effect of emotions and identity on the expression of political attitudes. Education In 2005, Haas earned a B.A. in psychology and political science from the University of St.Thomas in Minnesota. She earned an M.A in 2008 and a Ph.D. in social psychology in 2012 from the Ohio State University . Career Haas is currently the Graduate Program chair and Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Nebraska Lincoln . She also serves as the Resident Faculty in the Center for Brain, Biology, and Behavior, where she is director of the Political Attitudes and Cognition Lab and Faculty Coordinator of the Political Science Experimental Participant Pool (PSEPP). She is also affiliated with the Department of Psychology. As of May 2022, Haas has been appointed as a Faculty Fellow with the UNL National Strategic Institute (NSRI), and received a grant with fellow academic Rupal Mehta to study the neuroscience behind nuclear decision making, for a proposal titled, \u201cIdeology and Risk: How Neuroscience can Inform Nuclear Security.\u201d Haas has also been named a Faculty Fellow of the Nebraska Governance and Technology Center for 2022-2023. Research Haas' primary interests include the determinants of individual attitudes and beliefs; emotion, mood, and affect; and ethics and morality and its implications for social cognition, political psychology, and prejudice and stereotyping. Haas uses functional MRI (fMRI) and survey data collection to explore how the political attitudes and beliefs of people are structured with respect to social and political stimuli. The lab uses theories and methods from political and social psychology along with cognitive neuroscience to conduct its research. A 2020 article from Scientific American titled, \"Conservative and Liberal Brains Might Have Some Real Differences,\" summarizes one of Haas' findings, as follows: \"In a 2017 study with her colleagues, Haas created hypothetical candidates, each belonging to the Democratic or Republican party with an assigned stances on policy issues. Some of the assigned positions were \u201cexpected\u201d based on the candidate\u2019s party affiliation whereas others were unexpected. The research sought to understand how political information is processed and found that when posed with the unexpected takes from candidates, liberals proved to be more attentive, taking longer to decide their stance on the information.\" References ^ a b \"Loop | Ingrid J.

{"id": "doc_random_205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chill_Out_(KLF_album)", "text": "Chill Out is the third studio album by British electronic music group the KLF , released on 5 February 1990. Their first album after changing their name from \"the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu\", it is an ambient -styled concept album featuring an extensive selection of samples , portraying a mythical night-time journey throughout the U.S. Gulf Coast states, beginning in Texas and ending in Louisiana . Chill Out was conceived as a continuous piece of music, with original KLF music interwoven with samples from songs by Elvis Presley , Fleetwood Mac , Acker Bilk , Van Halen , 808 State and field recordings of Tuvan throat singers . Context Chill Out was released during the KLF's ambient phase, and was credited by Bob Stanley for pioneering ambient house , drawing attention to the album's mix of \"train noises, post-punk dub and pre-punk Floyd .\" It has also been described as a sound collage , with its blend of sound effects, environmental noise, throat singing and musical samples . Composition and recording \" Madrugada Eterna \" first appeared on the 1989 single \" Kylie Said to Jason \". According to the sleeve notes, Chill Out was recorded \"live on location\" at Trancentral , the \"spiritual home of the KLF\", their studio in the basement of KLF member Jimmy Cauty 's squat in Stockwell , South London . The KLF have stated that the album was recorded in a 44-minute live take. In an interview Jimmy Cauty stated that, \"There's no edits on it. Quite a few times we'd get near the end and make a mistake and so we'd have to go all the way back to the beginning and set it all up again\". According to Cauty's co-founder of the KLF, Bill Drummond , the album took two days to put together. Record Collector compared the KLF's production method to that of established electronic musicians: \"While electronic dinosaurs like Jean Michel Jarre and Klaus Schulze were walling themselves in with banks and banks of synthesizers, computers and electronic gadgetry the KLF were doing the opposite\u2014making a crafted work like Chill Out with the bare necessities of musical survival.\" After recording, the duo thought the sound to be evocative of a trip through the American Deep South . Drummond said \"I've never been to those places. I don't know what those places are like, but in my head, I can imagine those sounds coming from those places, just looking at the map.\" The titles of the parts are poetic descriptions\u2014often complete sentences\u2014incorporating statements of time, place and situation along the Gulf Coast journey. Chill Out is a single continuous musical piece having many distinctive sections, each of which either segues into or introduces the next. The album as a whole is a progression, with percussion gradually introduced during the second half. The album has many recurring musical elements, which unify and merge the parts into the collective whole. Common characteristics of most parts include ethereal background synthesizers, the use of echo and pitch bend , samples of nature and transport, and the punctuation of soft synthesizer loops by sudden flourishes of harmonious sound. The Deep South is variously represented using original pedal steel contributions from Graham Lee and emotionally charged samples of US radio broadcasts: an evangelist 's sermon, a range of samples of a very intense salesman, and, in \" Madrugada Eterna \", a detailed news report of the road accident in Wantagh that resulted in the death of 17-year-old Jack Atsidakos. Despite the specific US settings, Chill Out is multi-ethnic, its journey taking in pastoral shepherds, Russian broadcasts, Tuvan throat singers (\"Dream Time in Lake Jackson\"), exotic birds, and an African-sounding original female vocal from the JAMs ' 1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?) that later became the KLF's \" Justified and Ancient \". Elements of the KLF's \"Pure Trance\" singles \" 3 a.m. Eternal \" and \" Last Train to Trancentral \" are brought to the fore during the second half of the album, progressing from the minimalist synths of the opening half. Similarly, samples of other artists' work appear as the composition develops, harmonising with the KLF's original instrumentation. Identified samples The samples used in Chill Out contribute fundamentally to the character of the composition. In particular, the recurring sampled sound effects of rolling stock and other transport illustrate the journey concept, often during segues between parts of the composition. Many of these effects are taken from the 1987 CD version of Elektra Records ' Authentic Sound Effects Volume 2 . The tracks used are \"Crossing Bells and Horn with Electric Train Pass\" and \"Short Freight Train Pass\", along with processed versions of \"F18 Diamond Fly-By\", \"Dodge Van Starts, Drives Out\", and \"Surf\". Samples of American, British and Russian radio stations are also used, including the BBC pips and a jingle from Tommy Vance 's Friday Rock Show on BBC Radio 1 : \"Rock radio into the nineties and beyond\". Some of the more obscure sounds (Tuvan throat singers and Basque shepherds in the Pyrenees) come from the Saydisc Records soundtrack of the 1980s Disappearing World series on Granada TV in the UK. The phrase \"Your feeling of helplessness is your best friend, savage\" is taken from the 1957 science fiction film The Brain from Planet Arous . The album features samples of distinctive melodies from the musical recordings of other artists: Elvis Presley 's 1969 UK No. 2 single \" In the Ghetto \", Fleetwood Mac 's 1968 UK No. 1 single \" Albatross \", as well as \" Oh Well Part II \", and Acker Bilk 's 1961 US No. 1 single \" Stranger on the Shore \" all feature prominently, in each case set to an accompaniment of original music. The composers of these hits receive co-writing credit for \"Elvis on the Radio Steel Guitar in My Soul\", \"3am Somewhere out of Beaumont\", and \"A Melody from a Past Life Keeps Pulling Me Back\" respectively, and the performers are thanked in the Chill Out sleevenotes. Boy George 's band Jesus Loves You is also thanked for a sample from the single \"After the Love\", which also features on \"3am Somewhere out of Beaumont\". Short samples from the Van Halen instrumental \" Eruption \" emerge throughout the songs \"A Melody from a Past Life Keeps Pulling Me Back\" and \"Rock Radio into the Nineties and Beyond\". Shortly after the 2:00 mark of \"The Lights of Baton Rouge Pass By\", a sample from the theme music of the 1958 film The Big Country can be heard as well as \" Pacific State \" by 808 State . Reception Ian Cranna of Q , reviewing Chill Out at the time of its release, described the album as an \"impressionist soundtrack\" whose \"spartan but melodic electronic strains ease gently through wide open spaces\", and concluded that it is \"both imaginative in itself and successful in inducing a blissed out mood of peace and relaxation (at least at night).\" NME called Chill Out \"a riot of running water, birdsong and electronic womb music\"; reviewer Helen Mead said that the album, with its variety of sampled sounds, \"not so much \u00a0 ... distracts you as envelops you\". Record Mirror ' s Phil Cheeseman summarised Chill Out as \"one long piece of flowing synthesised relaxation dotted with some very witty samples\", recommending that it be listened to \"as a prelude to a long night in, preferably not alone.\" Ian McCann of The Face proposed that if the listener is not under the influence of drugs, the album sounds \"hopelessly pompous and almost classical.\" In Sounds , Russell Brown panned it as \"too arbitrary and formless; it contains virtually no ozone-destroying beats at all.\" In a 1994 retrospective review, Q ' s Andrew Collins described The KLF as \"ahead of their time\" and added that \"the fact that Chill Out was seen largely as a urinary extraction exercise at the time when such sound-painting now shapes young careers lends poignancy to its more balmy yet knowing moments.\" The Times called the album The KLF's \"comedown classic\", while John Bush of AllMusic awarded it five stars and cited it as \"one of the essential ambient albums\". In an \"On Second Thought\" review in Stylus Magazine , writer Scott Plagenhoef found Chill Out to be \"less a morning after and more the slow awakening to a new day\" and an album which \"slowly unfolds its charms\". Ira Robbins of Trouser Press was less favourable, likening it to \"an accidental recording of 1970 Pink Floyd sessions during which all the participants have either left or fallen asleep\" and calling it \"the pleasantly attenuated soundtrack to a non-existent film that is easily forgotten.\" In a 1996 feature, Mixmag named Chill Out the fifth best dance album of all time, citing Jimmy Cauty and Alex Paterson as having \"kickstarted\" ambient music with their DJ sets at the \"seminal\" house night \"Land of Oz\". Dom Philips of Mixmag described Chill Out as \"a gorgeous patchwork of sound, noise and melody\u00a0... the samples are carefully woven into a beautiful spider's web of sound.\" In 2008, Pitchfork included \"Wichita Lineman Was a Song I Once Heard\" in The Pitchfork 500 , their list of the 500 greatest songs between 1977 and 2006, and later ranked the track at number 80 in their \"Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s\" list in 2010. In 2022, Pitchfork ranked the album at number 76 in their list of \"The 150 Best Albums of the 1990s\". Themes The use of a journey as a unifying musical or conceptual thread featured several times in Cauty and Drummond's work, including The White Room , \" Last Train to Trancentral \", \" Justified and Ancient \" and \" America: What Time Is Love? \". Cauty's Space and The Orb 's debut album, The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld also employ the journey concept. Sheep, which appear both on the recording of Chill Out \u2014as guest vocalists according to Scott Piering 's press release \u2014and in its sleeve artwork, became a theme of The KLF's output, featuring in the ambient video Waiting , The White Room album artwork, and later\u2014in a macabre gesture\u2014after their controversial appearance at the 1992 Brit Awards ceremony . Drummond credits the sleeve of Pink Floyd 's Atom Heart Mother as providing inspiration for the artwork of Chill Out . Drummond has documented his affinity for pedal steel and country music , stating that although he has \"loved all sorts of music,\u00a0... country music is the only music [he's] been totally able to identify with\", and declaring: \"the weep of a pedal steel guitar is the sound of heartstrings being torn\". According to Drummond, the album and album sleeve has \"the vibe of the rave scene over here [in the UK]. When we're having the big Orbital raves out in the country, and you're dancing all night and then the sun would come up in the morning, and then you'd be surrounded by this English rural countryside\u00a0... we wanted something that kind of reflected that, that feeling the day after the rave, that's what we wanted the music for\". The cover was also inspired by that of the Pink Floyd album Atom Heart Mother . Personnel The sleeve notes that the album was \"Composed Compiled and Collated by the KLF\". Simon Reynolds (1999) and Mark Prendergast (2003) report the uncredited involvement of Alex Paterson, whereas a 1993 piece in i-D \u2014in which Paterson was interviewed\u2014claimed that Chill Out was a \"spin-off\" from the Cauty/Paterson sessions at Trancentral. However, in a 2011 interview with Magnetic Magazine , Paterson corroborated his involvement and contribution to the album and said he had in fact been \"ripped off\" by The KLF and notably Cauty, stating; \"KLF put the Chill Out album out, which was basically a bunch of my DJ sessions at Trancentral which I never got credited for. That was one of the major reasons why Jimi and I split up. It was becoming apparent to me that everything he said he had given me, he never gave me. That shaped quite a lot of things in my head. Never to be ripped off again, I suppose. Don't worry, I got ripped off again. But as Jimi said to me, you're never really famous until you've been ripped off.\" Legacy In August 1990, the single \" What Time Is Love? (Remodelled & Remixed)\" was released. It included the ambient house \"Virtual Reality Mix\", reprising many elements of Chill Out . Elements of Chill Out also featured heavily in The KLF's \"UFO Mix\" of \"It Must Be Obvious\" by Pet Shop Boys , released in September 1990 and incorporating \"What Time Is Love?\", a \"Pure Trance\" track not used on the LP. In July 2004, UK performance collective Popdamage \"reconstructed\" Chill Out as a live performance at The Big Chill music festival, recreating many of the album's vocal and musical samples live on-stage. In February 2021, the KLF released Come Down Dawn , a reworking of Chill Out with a selection of prominent but unlicensed samples from the original release removed. Track listing The track listing of Chill Out uses the start- and end-points of the parts, instead of the conventional track numbering system, indicating that the album be treated as a single composition. For the original KLF Communications CD release, the entire album was written to one track. Notes ^ \" Madrugada Eterna \" is Spanish for \"Eternal Dawn\". ^ A \"urinary extraction exercise\" is (in convoluted British slang ) a \" piss take \" \u2013 a targeted joke disguised as something serious. ^ Paterson and Cauty were the original incarnation of The Orb; they split in April 1990, with Paterson retaining the name. The subsequent release of the ambient Space LP\u2014originally intended to be The Orb's debut album \u00a0\u2014was credited only to Cauty.

Originally a co-educational college, it became a boys-only college in the 1930s. Edwardes has become co-educational again since 2000 with about 200 female students and 15 women among its faculty members, with the number of women anticipated to increase. The college has a vital community life, which includes freedom of worship for all faiths, sporting events, a debating society, drama productions, and student publications. Up to 1974 the institution was run by as organisation affiliated with the Church Mission Society. However, following Nationalisation Reforms of 1974 it was handed over to the Board of Governors headed by NWFP Governor. A ruling of the Peshawar High Court dated 14 November 2019 dismissed the plea of the Principal challenging the nationalisation of the college. Edwardes College Lawn History Sir Herbert Benjamin Edwardes after whom college was named. Edwardes College, Peshawar The Church Missionary Society established the Church Mission College in 1900 as an outgrowth of Edwardes High School, which had been founded in 1855 by the society as the first institution of western-style schooling in the northwest frontier region of what was British India. For many years the college was the only institution of higher education in the northwest frontier. Sir Herbert Edwardes was a British colonial administrator and commander whose name the college later adopted. The first major college building, now known as the Old Hall, was built in 1910 in a Moghul style that was replicated in a number of the college's later buildings. Edwardes College was visited three times by the founder of the nation, Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah , by Mahatma Gandhi , and the previous Archbishop of Canterbury , Rowan Williams . In its early years Edwardes awarded degrees through the University of Punjab ; since 1952 its degrees have been awarded through the University of Peshawar. Hostel Edwardes has hostel accommodation for about 200 male students. The main hostel is composed of four halls; 1. Edmonds Hall ( 1st Year Students ) 2. Woolmer Hall ( 2nd Year Students ) 3.

{"id": "doc_random_208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._1_Combat_Communications_Squadron_RAAF", "text": "The Royal Australian Air Force's No. 1 Combat Communications Squadron (1CCS) is a squadron within No. 95 Wing and is responsible for the provision of expeditionary Communications and Information Systems (CIS) to support Air Force and Australian Defence Force operations and exercises. History 1CCS was formed on 20 September 1965 as the Air Transportable Telecommunications Unit (ATTU) . ATTU's role was to provide simple Communication Centres (COMCENs) in the field in support of air operations. Over the years, the role has evolved to also include Air Traffic Control systems, navigational aids, and CIS required to establish a fully functioning military air base. On 1 July 1999, after providing communications support for 34 years, ATTU was retitled No 1 Combat Communications Squadron, however the role of the squadron remained the same. 1CCS has a long and distinguished record of providing tactical Communications and Information Systems in support of Australian Defence Force operations and exercises. 1CCS has grown significantly over the years, from 12 people in 1965 to the present day, where about 380 personnel provide tactical and temporary CIS support to operations, exercises, and other activities in support of Air Force and the Australian Defence Force . Capabilities that 1CCS can provide are many and varied. These include the deployable provision of radio systems, ICT systems, and air traffic control support systems. This can be provided from established Air Force bases, remote locations or anywhere in the world. 1CCS is often required to provide tactical and temporary communications during disaster relief operations local to Australia or overseas. 1CCS's personnel are primarily network technicians (NETECH) managed by electrical engineers (ELECTR). The squadron also has a cadre of administration, logistics and ground support personnel. The Squadron Headquarters and the Amberley Flight are located at RAAF Base Amberley on the outskirts of Brisbane in Queensland. Flights of personnel and equipment are also located at RAAF Base Williamtown in New South Wales and RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia. On 20 September 2015, 1CCS celebrated its 50th anniversary. Active service Personnel and equipment from 1CCS and ATTU have deployed on nearly every major operation, humanitarian assistance mission and exercise that the Air Force has been involved in since 1965. Major operational deployments include: Afghanistan (Large-scale Combat mission) Timor Leste 2006 (Counter-insurgent mission) Solomon Islands 2003 (Small-scale mission) Iraq 2003 (Large-scale combat mission) Kyrgyzstan 2002 (Medium to large scale combat mission) East Timor 1999\u20132000 (Medium scale combat mission) Cambodia 1991 (Medium to Large scale combat mission) Sumatra Assist 2004-2005 (Humanitarian) Papua New Guinea Assist 2007 (Humanitarian) Pakistan Assist II 2010-2012 (Humanitarian) Kabul Evacuation 2021 (Humanitarian) Bushfire Assist 2020 (Domestic Support) COVID Assist (Domestic Support) Flood Assist 22 (Domestic Support) Honours and awards 2019 Markowski Cup 2009 Markowski Cup 2003 Meritorious Unit Citation 1995 Duke of Gloucester Cup (ATTU) Meritorious Unit Citation For sustained outstanding service in warlike operations in providing expeditionary communication and information systems support during Operations BASTILLE and FALCONER. Number 1 Combat Communications Squadron is based at Royal Australian Air Force Base Richmond, and was given the mission of providing communications and information systems support to deployed elements of the Royal Australian Air Force, on deployment on combat operations in the Middle East Area of Operations. During Operations BASTILLE and FALCONER, the Squadron provided meritorious service to the Royal Australian Air Force mission through the provision of expeditionary combat communications to elements which were deployed to four separate locations in the Middle East Area of Operations. The successful provision of this vital communications support was only achieved after the Squadron completed detailed tactical planning and identified and completed some extensive modifications to existing and new communications equipment in a very short timeframe to meet the planned mission. The requirement for the communications packages and personnel to be able to integrate with the Coalition Theatre communications plan meant the Squadron was required to mobilise all of its Australian-based communications assets and trained personnel. In addition, the Squadron had to undertake specialised force and battle preparation activities of personnel and equipment. Under considerable time pressure, the Squadron worked very long hours and showed outstanding ingenuity and resourcefulness to provide the right communications packages capable of supporting air combat operations. The Unit demonstrated the highest levels of professional excellence, technical expertise and dedication throughout the hectic preparation period. Once deployed to the Area of Operations, the Squadron elements provided manning and specialist expertise in the delivery of the full range of communications and data requirements for the Australian aviation elements. The Squadron successfully provided air-ground-air voice nets, satellite communications bearers, classified and restricted information systems and conduits for the delivery of joint command and control and logistics systems. The communications provided by Number 1 Combat Communications Squadron ensured that the functions of command, air combat, air transport and logistics could be carried out with speed and confidence by all levels of the Australian command team and the operational elements. In addition, that these critical communications and network links were sustained under heavy usage and in a harsh and demanding environment is a credit to the hard work, professional skills and ingenuity of the Squadron personnel. Their efforts played a major part in the success of the Australian contribution to the Coalition to disarm Iraq. Through the combined efforts of the Squadron's command, planning, maintenance, logistics and technical sections, Number 1 Combat Communications Squadron provided meritorious service to the Royal Australian Air Force in the provision of expeditionary communications support during Operations BASTILLE and FALCONER. Members that were posted to the Squadron and deployed on Operation FALCONER in 2003 are entitled to wear the Meritorious Unit Citation Badge with Federation Star for life. Personnel who joined the Squadron after Operation FALCONER are entitled to wear the Meritorious Unit Citation Badge without Federation Star for the duration of their posting to 1CCS. Squadron badge Original Unit Badge: February 1973 (Air Transportable Telecommunications Unit) Background and Description: In front of a flash of lightning fessways a boomerang. Motto: Adroit (Dextrous, Skillful) Close Copy: 26 April 2000 (No 1 Combat Communications Squadron) Status: Active Unit, Richmond NSW Crown Bound by: St Edwards Monarch: Elizabeth R The Design: The flash of lightning is intended to refer to radio communications by the use of electrical energy signifying the basic function of the unit which is to provide tactical communications and navigation aids in support of air operations in forward areas. The boomerang, in flight, refers to the use of air transportation as the normal means of deployment of unit personnel and equipment to the tactical areas and, consequently the need for all unit equipment to be air transportable. Governor-General's Banner The Governor-General's Banner is awarded by the Governor-General , to non-operational Squadrons for 25 years service to the Royal Australian Air Force. The 1CCS Governor-General's Banner was consecrated in 2003. On the 90th anniversary of the formation of the Royal Australian Air Force, 31 March 2011, 1CCS was awarded an operational streamer to attach to the Governor-General's Banner in recognition of the Meritorious Unit Citation it was awarded in 2003 for warlike operations on Operation FALCONER.

{"id": "doc_random_209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Parrot_(band)", "text": "King Parrot are an Australian grindcore band formed in Melbourne in 2010. They have released four studio albums: Bite Your Head Off (2012), Dead Set (2015), Ugly Produce (2017) and A Young Persons' Guide to King Parrot (2025). History King Parrot formed in Melbourne in 2010 with the original line-up of Matt Young (vocals), Ed Lacey and Ari White (guitar), Slatts Everday (bass) and drummer Matt Rizzo. White, Rizzo and Lacey had come directly from their previous band Watchdog Discipline, Slatts Everday was a member of Warrnambool rock band Cockfight Shootout. Lacey had also been a member of The Berzerker for several years and Rizzo was formerly with Blood Duster . After the release of The Stench of Hardcore Pub Trash EP in 2011, Lacey left King Parrot and was replaced by Andrew Livingstone-Squires, formerly of Dreadnaught and Cemetery Urn. The group recorded and independently released their debut full-length album Bite Your Head Off in 2012, which was picked up by UK based metal label Candlelight Records in 2013 for worldwide release. Shortly after the album's release Rizzo was replaced by Matt \"Skitz\" Sanders , formerly of Damaged but the band's heavy touring schedule meant he was replaced on overseas dates by Rob Brens of Alarum . King Parrot had by now established themselves as intense live act, and their unsettling sense of humour, most notably in their music video \"Shit on the Liver\", which was a finalist in the 2013 Australian Music Video Awards. After extensive touring within Australia, supporting Obituary , Carcass and Thy Art Is Murder , King Parrot were invited to play a number of prominent music festivals including an appearance at the 2013 Hammersonic Jakarta International Metal Festival in Indonesia , Australia's Soundwave Festival and the 2014 SXSW in Austin, Texas , which was part of a 45-date North American tour. They later signed a management deal with Extreme Management Group in New York. Pantera and Down vocalist Phil Anselmo personally interviewed them on his Housecore Records YouTube channel. In June 2014, at the end of their Australian tour with Carcass, it was announced that Todd Hansen, formerly of The Berzerker and Headkase , would be taking over from Sanders. In late 2014 King Parrot recorded their second album Dead Set at Anselmo's studio in Louisiana . It was released in May 2015 and peaked on the Australian albums chart at #21. Dead Set was nominated for an ARIA Award for Best Hard Rock or Heavy Metal Album that year but lost to Northlane 's Node . King Parrot toured Australia with Psycroptic and Revocation in early 2017, following which the band recorded their third album in Melbourne. Ugly Produce was released on 22 September and reached #21 on the ARIA chart. During October, the band toured the US with Superjoint and DevilDriver . The singles \"Banished, Flawed then Docile\" and \"Nor is Yours\" - the second featuring Anselmo on vocals - were released in 2020 while the band was unable to tour due to COVID restrictions. The EP Holed Up in the Lair appeared in October of that year. A tour 10th anniversary Australian tour was postponed and rescheduled several times in 2021. During 2023 King Parrot toured extensively throughout Australia and the US once again and in March 2024 they were the opening band at Knotfest Australia.

The Shrine of Khawaja Abu Nasr Parsa ( Pashto : \u0632\u06cc\u0627\u0631\u062a \u062e\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u0627\u0628\u0648\u0646\u0635\u0631 \u067e\u0627\u0631\u0633\u0627 , romanized:\u00a0 Ziyarat-i Khwajah Abu Nasr Parsa ) is a mausoleum dedicated to the Naqshbandi mystic and religious teacher, Khwaja Abu Nasr Parsa , located in Balkh , Afghanistan . Today it is part of the Green Mosque complex. History Khwaja Abu Nasr Parsa died in 1461, and later on a mausoleum was erected over his grave by the Timurid general, Mir Mazid Arghun. Yet some sources state it to be the Timurid ruler Mir Jalal al-Din Farid Arghun. The mausoleum and the adjoining mosque were renovated by the Shaybanid governor Abdul-Mo'min bin Abdullah Khan in the late 16th century. Local tradition maintains that the tomb of the Khwaja is outside the main entrance iwan of the building. However, upon excavation of a crypt below the building, an unmarked tomb was discovered. Researchers identified this grave as that of Khwaja Abu Nasr Parsa. In modern times, the site fell into disrepair during the Soviet-Afghan war . Architecture The plan of the shrine is a chambered square enveloping a cross-shaped dome chamber aligned with the qibla along the southwest-northeast axis. Its elevation is outshadowed by the monumental portal screen and dome. Eight openings allow light to enter the dome, but some of them have cracked, revealing the inner structure of the dome. The dome has a base of muqarnas and the bottom part is covered with floral designs and ceramic tiles. Underneath the dome chamber, underground, there is a crypt containing an unmarked tomb, said to be that of Abu Nasr Parsa. A column was added later to support the crown of the crypt vault.

The Winterstoke sun shelter and rock gardens are located on Victoria Parade, Ramsgate , Kent , United Kingdom. Overlooking the sea, the ornamental gardens were laid out and presented to the Borough of Ramsgate by Dame Janet Stancomb-Wills in 1920 and opened to the public in June 1923 by the Mayor of Ramsgate (Alderman A. W. Larkin). They are maintained by Thanet District Council and were Grade II listed on 4 February 1988. The site is listed on the Ramsgate Society`s Buildings at risk register . A map of Ramsgate`s East Cliff, showing the location of the Winterstoke Gardens in relation to later proposed developments in the area. The East Kent Times, 2 January 1935 The gardens were designed by the architects Sir John Burnet & Partners , and constructed by Pulham and Son. The main feature of the gardens, is a semi-circular shaped colonnade carved into the pulhamite recess. Inside the shelter, and now lost, were two pieces of sculpture work by Mr. Gilbert Bayes. They represented children playing with the \"Ram\" of Ramsgate. On the upper terrace, approached by broad flights of steps, the gardens proper are reached. In the centre, and immediately over the shelter, is a circular pool enclosed on the north side by a semi-circular Roman seat.

{"id": "doc_random_212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Konopka", "text": "'The devil Pole', Vistula Uhlan in Spain by Jan Chelminski Jan Konopka (1777 in Sko\u0142odycze near S\u0142onim \u2013 12 December 1814 in Warsaw ) was a lieutenant in the Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising , captain of the Polish Legions in Italy, regiment commander in the Legion of the Vistula , as well as general of the French Army and the Duchy of Warsaw . Konopka has been described as \"a brave man with cold mind in combat.\" Biography Konopka was the son of Anna, a distant relative of the Princes of Conde , and Franciszek Konopka, a major in Lithuanian army of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth . From 1792 he was a Second Lieutenant in the Ukrainska Brygada Kawalerii Narodowej ( National Ukrainian Cavalry Brigade ) and took part in the Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792 (in Poland known as War in Defence of the Constitution ). He fought in the Battle of Ziele\u0144ce and was decorated. During the Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising he fought as a lieutenant at Battle of Maciejowice , was wounded, and decorated again. After the failure of the insurrection he emigrated to France and volunteered for the French army . In 1797 Konopka joined the Polish Legions in Italy with a rank of captain and took part in all of the Legion's campaigns. After the dissolution of the Legion, he returned to service in France as a Major. He was soon made a regiment commander in the Legion of the Vistula . He fought in the War of the Fourth Coalition and for his part in the Battle of Friedland was decorated with the L\u00e9gion d'honneur . Subsequently he fought as part of Napoleon's forces in the Peninsular War where he experienced further successes (for example, at the Battle of Ciudad-Real ) as well as failures (at the Battle of Yevenes ). In 1811 he was made a general of the French army after the Battle of Albuera and later of, Duchy of Warsaw , and a Baron of the French Empire . During Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812 he was made the commander of the 3rd Regiment of Lithuanian Guards. Due to an absent minded mistake he allowed himself to be surprised and attacked by General Eufemiusz Czaplic . Some sources report that he quartered in Slonim too long, hoping to train newly recruited volunteers and throwing banquets, while others state that he decided to attack a numerically superior force. Most of his unit was captured, the rest scattered (only the Lipka Tatar units that were out on patrol escaped) and he himself was wounded and taken prisoner. Konopka was interned in Cherson . After being released from prison in 1814 he was offered the command of the 1st Cavalry Brigade of Congress Poland but he declined. Exhausted by wounds, prison, and fatigue he died the same year in Warsaw.

According to 2021 IBGE data, it has a population of 51,292 inhabitants. History The history of Est\u00e2ncia Velha began with the arrival of the indigenous people. After their presence, records indicate that in 1788, the area became part of the Real Feitoria do Linho C\u00e2nhamo, established on the banks of the Rio dos Sinos to occupy the land for the Portuguese Crown and produce hemp, a raw material for making ship rigging that Portugal exported to other countries. When the occupation plan failed to meet expectations, the lands of the Real Feitoria were distributed to German immigrants in 1824, during the period of Imperial Brazil under Dom Pedro. The first German immigrant to settle in Est\u00e2ncia Velha was Mathias Franzen, who cleared the land and began farming. As a shoemaker, he also practiced his trade from 1830 onwards, which he had learned in Europe. His arrival was followed by that of other immigrant families. In the late 19th century, the foundation for the town's industrial development was laid. Est\u00e2ncia Velha's leather industry dates back to 1890, initially focusing on saddles and riding accessories before expanding to tanning hides and producing footwear, which became the region's main economic driver. With both industry and agriculture thriving, Est\u00e2ncia Velha was designated as the seat of the tenth district of S\u00e3o Leopoldo on 15 January 1930. After nine years of advocacy, Est\u00e2ncia Velha was officially emancipated on 8 September 1959. Geography Est\u00e2ncia Velha is part of the Porto Alegre microregion within the Porto Alegre Metropolitan Mesoregion . It is one of the municipalities located in the Sinos River basin.

Based in Nazareth , the paper is Israel's most influential and widely read Arabic-language periodical. It is also distributed in the West Bank. Kul al-Arab has 70 employees and a circulation of 38,000. According to the BBC the paper \"is known primarily as a Christian paper\" but \"is trying to expand its Muslim audience.\" Most of the paper's revenue comes from advertising, and it is sometimes given away for free as a result. For some time the paper was edited by the poet Samih al-Qasim , who remained its honorary editor until 2014. In 2005, the BBC stated that the paper \"is scathing of Israeli and US policies, but can be equally critical of the Palestinian Authority.\" It has referred to convicted terrorists and suicide bombers as Martyrs . The paper was founded by an advertising agency, al-Bustenai, then-managed by Mussa Hassadiya. As of 2008 Hassadiya owns 40% of the paper, with the rest owned by Fayez and \"a group of Israeli-Arab businessmen.\" For a time Yedioth Ahronoth Group and Legal Tender Initiative each owned 25% of the paper, with Hassadiya and Shtiwi owning the other half. However, the two groups came into conflict, resulting in a court case in 2006 and Yediot and Legal Tender being bought out two years later. The paper's publishing company also owns a women's magazine, Lady Kul al-Arab , and a website, al-Arab , which is visited by 45,000 people per day. Kul al-Arab also sponsors an annual Israeli Arab beauty contest with a $10,000 prize.

{"id": "doc_random_220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCourtie_Park", "text": "McCourtie Park , originally dalled Aiden Lair , is a recreational park located at 10426 South Jackson Road (at US 12 ) in Somerset Center, Michigan . It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1991 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 under the name W. H. L. McCourtie Estate . The site may contain the country's largest collection of el trabejo rustico (known in French as faux bois ), the Mexican folk art tradition where wet concrete is sculpted to look like wood. History William Herbert Lee McCourtie, c. 1914 William Herbert Lee McCourtie was born in 1872 on a farm near Somerset Center, the eighth child of Mary Cohan McCourtie and Michael Doty McCourtie. He went to the University of Michigan and graduated with a law degree in 1891, and married Ellen D. Hulett in 1896. In 1897, he was introduced to the cement industry by W. F. Cowham of Jackson. He soon moved to Dallas, Texas , where he made a fortune in the oil business, and founded his own cement company, Trinity Portland Cement. In the 1920s, McCourtie returned to Somerset Center and in 1924 he purchased the family home and surrounding property and turned it into \"Aiden Lair,\" a community center where he hosted multiple events. He continued hosting free community events well into the Great Depression . McCourtie also hosted out-of-town luminaries; it is known that Henry Ford was a visitor to Aiden Lair. Around 1930, McCourtie hired two itinerant Mexican artisans, George Cardoso and Ralph Corona, to build 17 concrete bridges at Aiden Lair, spanning the winding stream that flowed through the property. Cardoso and Corona used a technique known as el trabejo rustico (known in French as faux bois ), a Mexican folk art tradition where wet concrete is sculpted to look like wood. The two had learned the craft from Dionicio Rodriguez , the most famous artisan in, and acknowledged master of, the genre. It is known that a third unidentified artisan assisted Cardoso and Corona; it has been speculated that the unknown third person was Rodriguez. The cement structures on the property were completed between 1930 and 1933. W. H. L. McCourtie died in 1933. After his death, the estate passed through multiple hands. In 1987, the estate was made into a public park. The house on the property was demolished, but the cement sculptures and an underground garage and rathskeller still remain. The McCourtie Estate is now a public park known as McCourtie Park, and in addition to the concrete sculptures contains a tennis court, basketball court, a fenced ball diamond, an 18 hole disc golf course, and a picnic area. Admission is free. Description Detail of a bridge at McCourtie Park The McCourtie Estate covers 42 acres (17\u00a0ha) and contains seventeen folk art cement bridges as well as two life-size cement trees that serve as chimneys for the underground garage and rathskeller. The structures are made using a technique known as el trabejo rustico , a Mexican folk art tradition where wet concrete is sculpted to look like wood. The artisans used steel rods as the base, then covered them with wet concrete and hand-sculpted the surface to resemble natural materials such as planed lumber, rough logs, thatch and rope. Two concrete pools and two large bird houses (one with 192 chambers and the other with 288) are also located on the property. Each of the seventeen bridges is unique, with one resembling a thatched cottage, and another resembling a swinging rope bridge. The sculptural elements are extremely detailed, showing \"hewing\" marks, wood grain, and individual fibers in the thatch and rope. Different tree species can be identified by the bark.

It holds the Guinness World Record for the longest continuously-running television magic series in the world. The show was created by presenter Dick Williams , who was recruited to WMC-TV in 1965 as a staff announcer and weatherman. Williams was a magician in his spare time and had started a magic show under the title Magicland for his previous station KGNC-TV in Amarillo, Texas. Management at WMC-TV liked the sound of that show and persuaded Williams to create something similar for them. He agreed, but thought the series would only last for about a year. Instead, it eventually ran for 23 years and nearly 1,200 episodes. Magicland was a weekly half-hour live-audience show aimed at children and aired at 10am on Sunday mornings. Dick \"Mr. Magic\" Williams performed tricks and illusions, juggled clubs and scarves, and is often remembered for his signature magician's finger exercises (photos at MagiclandTV.com). He was assisted by his wife, Virginia, who, in addition to her onscreen role, sewed costumes, organized props, arranged music, and directed other assistants.

{"id": "doc_random_222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Girl_Bullshit", "text": "\" Pretty Girl Bullshit \" (a title appearing censored on the clean versions of albums and in some reviews as \" Pretty Girl Bullsh*t \") is a R&B and rap song written and performed by Mario Winans and Foxy Brown (in the writing credit Brown uses her real name, Inga Marchand ). The song first appeared in 2003 on Bad Boys II , the soundtrack to the film of the same name . In 2004 it appeared on Hurt No More , Winans' second album. The voice of Sean Combs (the executive producer of the Bad Boys II soundtrack) can be heard in the song interjecting short phrases such as \"yeah, yeah! Let's go.\" Content The song is arranged as a sort of dialogue that indicates that Brown's character is the pretty girl whose \" bullshit \" troubles Winans. Unlike those delivered by Brown, the lyrics sung by Winans do not include profanity ; \"Take your pretty girl bull\" is his harshest phrase. Brown's rap takes the narrative position of chiding Winans for infidelity and, in particular, for his generosity to other women. She complains that he has \"had a hoe rockin' my red gold Cartier on her wrist\" and \"y'all don't want a girl in Yves Saint Laurent , You'd rather fuck a hoe in a bullshit Gabann' \". Characteristically, Brown also makes various boasts which include namechecking Sean Combs, saying that \"I'm in Caprice\" (perhaps referring to Capri ), and bragging \"I'm a Bad girl, illest bitch grinding... Sean John Rolls hold chocolate diamonds ...\" Winans, in contrast, delivers far less aggressive lyrics in his characteristic R&B style. In the song's intro he sings \"I can't live with you\" several times. As the song progresses, he expresses doubts about their compatibility singing \"What am I to do, when you act a fool\" and \"What you had in me, too fine to see.\" By the middle of the song, he is explicitly dismissive of his partner's \"pretty girl bull\" and sings \"...if you wanna go, walk right out that door...If you wanna leave, it's okay with me...Matter of fact I'm begging please.\" All three artists add various phrases ad libitum , particularly in the last two choruses . Reviews In a generally good review of Hurt No More , a reviewer for Allmusic spoke negatively about this song saying: Winans doesn't wear the few occurrences of harder-edged material so well -- \"Pretty Girl Bullsh*t,\" featuring an ill-matched verse from Foxy Brown, is particularly out of character and disrupts the lush, sensual flow of the record. A couple minor blunders like that hardly prevent Hurt No More from being one of the finest R&B albums of the year. Independent reviewers of the Bad Boys II soundtrack on Amazon.com conveyed an equally negative reaction. One called it \"another mistake\". Another opined that the song \"falls under skip material for me.\" A review for musicOMH.com criticizes the song saying it is... ..an awkward listen with clear West Coast allusions in the beat, which feels completely wrong in the context and delivery of the track. Another review of Bad Boys II complains: By the time we get to the rather worryingly title Pretty Girl Bullshit by Marion [ sic ] Winans and Foxy Brown things are getting rather tired. PGB seems to be about Winans going on about how much he dislikes people like Foxy Brown. That could be wishful thinking though - on my part. On the other hand, in reviewing Hurt No More Rolling Stone said \"Winans nails all the emo cues...[for example] resentment on \"Pretty Girl Bullsh*t\".

{"id": "doc_random_223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_(botany)", "text": "For the \"pit\" inside some fruits, see Pyrena . Bordered pits in the wood of Picea abies . The top section is a cross-sectional view with bordered pits shown between adjacent cells, and the bottom section is a radial view with numerous bordered pits shown. Pits in botany are relatively thinner portions of the cell wall that adjacent cells can communicate or exchange fluid through. Pits are characteristic of cell walls with secondary layers . Generally each pit has a complementary pit opposite of it in the neighboring cell. These complementary pits are called \"pit pairs\". Pits are composed of three parts: the pit chamber, the pit aperture, and the pit membrane. The pit chamber is the hollow area where the secondary layers of the cell wall are absent. The pit aperture is the opening at either end of the pit chamber. The pit membrane is the primary cell wall and middle lamella , or the membrane between adjacent cell walls, at the middle of the pit chamber. The primary cell wall at the pit membrane may also have depressions similar to the pit depressions of the secondary layers. These depressions are primary pit-fields, or primary pits. In the primary pit, the primordial pit provides an interruption in the primary cell wall that the plasmodesmata can cross. The primordial pit is the only aperture in the otherwise continuous primary cell wall. Pit pairs are a characteristic feature of xylem , as sap flows through the pits of xylem cells. Types of pits A simplified diagram of a simple pit pair Though pits are usually simple and complementary, a few more pit variations can be formed: Simple pits: A pit pair in which the diameter of the pit chamber and the diameter of the pit aperture are equal. Bordered pits: A pit pair in which the pit chamber is over-arched by the cell wall, creating a larger pit chamber and smaller pit aperture. Half bordered pits: A pit pair in which a bordered pit has a complementary simple pit. Such a pit pair is called half bordered pit pair. Blind pits: A pit pair in which a simple pit has no complementary pit. Compound pits: A pit pair in which one cell wall has a large pit and the adjacent cell wall has numerous small pits. Plasmodesmata Main article: Plasmodesma Plasmodesmata are thin sections of the endoplasmic reticulum that traverse pits and connect adjacent cells. These sections provide an avenue of transport through the pits and facilitate communication. Plasmodesmata are not restricted to pits however, as plasmodesmata often cross a cell wall of constant width and occasionally the cell wall is even wider in areas where plasmodesmata traverse it. Torus and margo A simplified diagram of a bordered pit-pair with a torus and margo. The top shows an unobstructed pit and the bottom shows an aspirated pit, with the margo flexing under stress. The torus and margo are characteristic features of bordered pit-pairs in gymnosperms , such as Coniferales , Ginkgo , and Gnetales . In other vascular plants , the torus is rare. The pit membrane is separated into two parts: a thick impermeable torus at the center of the pit membrane, and the permeable margo surrounding it. The torus regulates the functions of the bordered pit, and the margo is a cell wall-derived porous membrane that supports the torus. The margo is composed of bundles of microfibrils that radiate from the torus. The margo is flexible and can move towards either side of the pit while under stress. This allows the thick, impermeable torus to block the pit aperture. When the torus is displaced so that it blocks the pit aperture, the pit is said to be aspirated.

Marseillaise was a French light cruiser of the La Galissonni\u00e8re class . During the Second World War , she remained with Vichy France . Design and description The La Galissonni\u00e8re class was designed as an enlarged and improved version of the preceding Emile Bertin . The ships had an overall length of 179.5 meters (588\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in), a beam of 17.48 meters (57\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in), and a draft of 5.28 meters (17\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in). They displaced 7,722 metric tons (7,600 long tons ) at standard load and 9,460\u00a0t (9,310 long tons) at deep load . Their crew consisted of 557 men in peacetime and 612 in wartime. Construction and career When commissioned, Marseillaise joined the French Mediterranean Squadron and became the flagship of Contre-Amiral Decoux in 1938. In January 1939 she joined the 3rd Cruiser Division at Casablanca , and she was at Toulon when war was declared, as flagship of the 4th Squadron, part of Force Z . Marseillaise participated in the transport of gold to Canada in April 1940. Concerns regarding Italian intentions prompted reorganisation of French naval forces. The 3rd Cruiser Division was sent to Bizerte as part of the Force de Raid , to protect French interests in North Africa, should Italy enter the war. After the French surrender, on 4 July 1940, she returned to Toulon. As a result of the British attack on Mers-el-Kebir , the Germans suspended the disarming of the French fleet and Marseillaise became part of the newly formed High Seas force. In the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon , the ship was sabotaged by her crew and set on fire. The captain of Marseillaise was anxious that the Germans should not capture the ship. He ordered scuttling charges to be set and the sea valves opened only on one side, ignoring orders to sink his ship on an even keel. German commandos arrived at the gangplank but were refused permission to go aboard. They did not force the issue and stood on the dock and watched the ship slowly capsize . The last officers abandoned ship as explosions ripped the vessel apart and fires took hold. The ship's officers were taken prisoner, and the ship burned for seven days. The burnt-out hulk of Marseillaise was scrapped in 1946\u20131947. Citations ^ Jordan & Moulin, p. 124 Bibliography Jordan, John & Moulin, Jean (2013). French Cruisers 1922\u20131956 .

{"id": "doc_random_226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communion_token", "text": "A communion token with the word ADMISSIBLE, used by the Huguenot refugee community in Berlin A communion token is a metal token issued to members of Reformed churches in order to provide them entrance to the Lord's Supper . There were many types issued in Scotland in the 18th and 19th centuries, but they were largely superseded by communion cards. Overview Communion tokens were first suggested in 1560 by John Calvin and Pierre Viret in Geneva , and although the city council rejected the practice, the following year their idea was implemented in N\u00eemes and Le Mans . By 1586 communion tokens were in use at the Walloon church in Amsterdam . However, most were issued in Scotland, where over 5,000 types have been recorded. They were also issued in many other countries, especially Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States. Tokens were also issued by Presbyterian churches in Corfu , Florence , Hartslog , Madeira , Port Louis , Bombay , Cochin , Berbice , Demerara and Kingston, Jamaica . Most tokens are from the 19th century, but R. M. Grieg wrote in 1964 that they were still used by \"a few congregations in the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia .\" Communion tokens were also used in Scottish Episcopal churches. The reverse of a token from South Leith Parish Church The issuing of these tokens is dependent on the practice of closed communion , in which only members of the church are allowed to participate. Raymond Mentzer says that \"to avoid profanation of the Eucharist, the elders in the role as moral watchdogs distributed these entry counters to those members of the faithful whom they deemed qualified by virtue of correct belief and proper conduct.\" The distribution of the tokens would normally be preceded by catechetical instruction . The Glens of Antrim Historical Society notes that \"from the end of the nineteenth century metal tokens were gradually replaced by communion cards and rules regarding admission to the Lord\u2019s Table were eased, allowing visitors who were members of other denominations, on profession of their faith to communicate.\" Many tokens have verses on them, such as \"This do in remembrance of me\" ( 1 Corinthians 11 :24) or \"Let a man examine himself\" (1 Corinthians 11:28). They were made of lead or another base metal , and came in a variety of shapes: round, oval, square or oblong. Earlier tokens had the ministers' initials on them, and many had the name of the church. When the Free Church of Scotland was formed in 1843, many tokens were issued with that year and were used as stock tokens in many congregations. The burning bush is found on many tokens, as are objects such as a Bible , communion cup or communion table , or else Christian symbols such as the fish , lamb or cross . The Dunblane Museum has a collection of over 6000 tokens on display at the museum. A mould for making tokens Communion tokens belong to the field of exonumia .

{"id": "doc_random_228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_visa_revalidation", "text": "Automatic visa revalidation is one of a handful of exceptions to the general rule that a person who is not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident can only lawfully enter the United States if he/she has a valid visa. According to automatic visa revalidation, people on some non-immigrant visa statuses who visit Canada, Mexico or some adjacent islands close to the United States for a period of less than 30 days can re-enter the United States based on a valid Form I-94 even if their visa has expired. Rules A person is eligible for automatic visa revalidation provided the following conditions are met: The underlying authorization for the current status continues to be valid (such as the Form I-129 for non-immigrant workers or Form I-20 for students in F status). The person\u2019s absence from the United States was 30 days or less. The person did not visit any countries other than Mexico or Canada in that period. People on F visa or J visa statuses are also allowed to have visited adjacent islands to the United States (i.e., the Caribbean Islands ). The person does not have a pending (or rejected) application for a new visa. Since it is not possible to renew a non-immigrant visa in the United States a person on a non-immigrant visa may travel to a nearby country to apply for a new visa. However, such a person becomes ineligible for automatic visa revalidation based on the rules, so automatic visa revalidation cannot be used as a fallback option for somebody trying to renew an expired visa. The person is not a citizen of one of the countries designated by the US as a state sponsor of terrorism . As of 2018, the list includes four countries: North Korea (designated November 20, 2017), Iran (designated January 19, 1984), Sudan (designated December 29, 1979), and Syria (designated August 12, 1993). Similar exceptions The Visa Waiver Program allows nationals of 40 countries to enter the United States without visas, but they can enter only for short-term business/tourism trips, under conditions similar to those governing B visas . Some people currently in the United States can apply for advance parole that allows them to leave and re-enter the United States without a valid visa. Advance parole is not a generic re-entry permit. Relation with change of status Automatic visa revalidation also applies to cases where the applicant never acquired a visa for his or her current non-immigrant status but rather transitioned through it by filing the appropriate form to change non-immigrant status (such as Form I-129 or Form I-539 ). Instead of the \"visa\", what gets revalidated is the change of status, and therefore in lieu of the visa the applicant must carry the Form I-797 Approval Notice in addition to all the other supporting documentation. In particular, it does not matter if the applicant has never acquired a visa for the new status. References ^ a b \"Automatic Revalidation\" .

{"id": "doc_random_230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto_Mississauga", "text": "This article is about the university's campus in Mississauga, Ontario. For the university itself, see University of Toronto . The University of Toronto Mississauga ( UTM or U of T Mississauga ) is one of the three campuses of the University of Toronto and its second-largest academic division , located in Mississauga , Ontario , Canada. It is the second-largest of the University of Toronto's three campuses in terms of both student enrolment and land area. Known for its proximity to nature, the suburban campus is set upon 225 acres of protected forest along the valley of the Credit River in the city of Mississauga. It is located approximately 33\u00a0kilometres west of the St.\u00a0George campus in downtown Toronto . Originally established in 1967 as Erindale College , one of the University of Toronto's constituent colleges affiliated with the Faculty of Arts and Science , it became its own academic division of the university in 2003. The campus has since grown to become the university's second-largest division overall and its second-largest campus, the other two of which are St.\u00a0George and the Scarborough campus . The University of Toronto hosts degree programs at both the undergraduate and graduate level on its Mississauga campus in 15 academic departments and three institutions, including the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology (ICCIT). The campus mainly provides undergraduate education, and as part of the university's tri-campus structure, it hosts many of the same programs as the Faculty of Arts and Science on the St.\u00a0George campus. UTM offers graduate programs notably through the Mississauga Academy of Medicine , one of the four academies in the Temerty Faculty of Medicine 's MD program, and the Institute for Management and Innovation (IMI). History 1960\u20132000: Erindale College and early history In the early 1960s, the University of Toronto sought to establish two new constituent colleges at a distance from its first campus in Toronto to serve commuter students in the growing Greater Toronto region. In 1963, the university purchased a 150-acre area of a village called Springfield-on-the-Credit in the rural Toronto Township (which later became Mississauga ) and a separate plot of land east of Toronto which would become Scarborough College the same year. The Mississauga site was mainly farmland and included the Old Erindale Public School and Lislehurst , part of the Schreiber estate formerly owned by Reginald Watkins. Erindale College was founded on May 23, 1963, shortly after Scarborough College; however, its campus did not welcome its first cohort until four years later in 1967. Erindale and Scarborough were the first regional expansions of the University of Toronto, and its 11th and 12th colleges respectively at the time. They were the first colleges to establish their own campuses at a distance from the original St.\u00a0George campus . Erindale's first courses leading to the Bachelor of Arts degree were offered in 1965, at Thomas L. Kennedy Secondary School in Toronto Township. Its first principal was David Carlton Williams , who spearheaded the effort to establish the new campuses outside of Toronto. Its first dean was John Colman. Williams asked chemistry professor E.A. \"Peter\" Robinson to be the college's first associate dean, a role which he began in 1966. Robinson later went on to become dean of Erindale and its third principal. Construction of the college's first temporary building began in 1966, later known as the North Building. The site was officially opened as Erindale College, the University of Toronto's 13th college, in September 1967 to an inaugural class of 155 students. The main campus building, the William G. Davis Building , in 2005; then known as the South Building. During this time, it operated in affiliation with the Faculty of Arts and Science as \"the U. of T.'s western off-campus college.\" In 1969, the college hosted the first showcase of Moon rock samples in Canada. In 1970, it saw its first graduating class, which consisted of 70 students. Architect Raymond Moriyama was commissioned to create the original Campus Master Plan , which originally envisioned one \"central mega-structure\" on the bank of the Credit River that would preserve the surrounding natural environment. Construction on the first portion of the project, known as the South Building (today the William G. Davis Building) was completed in 1971. It was called the research wing, and later named in honour of Erindale College's second principal, John Tuzo Wilson . The final part of the South Building was completed in 1973. In 1975, Erindale College became the first college of the University of Toronto to be granted its own official coat of arms ; it displayed the Latin motto tantum nobis creditum , meaning \"so much has been entrusted to us.\" The period that followed the opening of the South Building saw Erindale College maintain a slow and steady growth. In 1981, the campus hosted the annual Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) conference, the first time it was held outside of the United States . The campus came to be known as the University of Toronto at Mississauga , the origin of its common abbreviation UTM . In 1992, the Kaneff Centre was opened, named after benefactor Ignat Kaneff . The Student Centre was opened in 1999. Located right in the centre of campus, it serves as the headquarters of the University of Toronto Mississauga Students' Union (UTMSU), The Medium newspaper, and various student clubs and societies. 2000\u2013present: Mississauga Campus The campus became an independent division in the 2002\u20132003 year, now acting as its own faculty of the University of Toronto separate from the Faculty of Arts and Science, with the University of Toronto at Mississauga as its official name. This reorganization saw the formal establishment of many of its own academic departments. The turn of the century saw substantial growth in its student population, and the campus underwent an expansion with the addition of several large academic buildings, including the Communication, Culture and Technology (CCT) building in 2004, and the Recreation, Athletics and Wellness Centre (RAWC) in 2006. New residence halls Erindale Hall and Oscar Peterson Hall were completed in 2003 and 2007 respectively. In 2007, the campus was re-branded to its present name, the University of Toronto Mississauga . That same year, it celebrated its 40th anniversary, a milestone which was capped off with the grand opening of the Hazel McCallion Academic Learning Centre \u2014 the new campus library building \u2014 on June 2, 2007. The 2010s saw the campus grow by approximately 1,000 students every year. More buildings were under construction to accommodate the student population, and older ones such as the South Building (renamed the William G. Davis Building) saw major renovations to modernize the spaces. New buildings were designed to be modern, both in appearance and their prioritization of sustainability with the goal of meeting LEED certification in all new campus structures. These included the Instructional Centre and Terrence Donnelly Health Sciences Complex in 2011. The Mississauga Academy of Medicine (MAM) opened in 2011 with a class of 54 students. It was created in partnership between the Temerty Faculty of Medicine and the three hospitals of the Mississauga-based Trillium Health Partners system to expands the university's MD program to the Mississauga campus. Construction of the Innovation Complex in 2013 2014 saw a $35 million expansion of the Kaneff Centre known as the Innovation Complex , which coincided with the establishment of the Institute for Management and Innovation (IMI), an academic unit which provides interdisciplinary graduate programs in business management including a Master of Business Administration . In April of that year, the UTM Eagles team started a varsity sports program becoming the 30th member of the Ontario College Athletic Association (OCAA). Sports offered included badminton, cross country, and men's and women's indoor soccer. Also during this time, plans were developed to replace the North Building, which had remained since the campus opened in 1967. The building began to be demolished, where it was replaced by Deerfield Hall: phase one of the reconstruction. The remaining North Building was fully removed by 2015, where some of its materials were repurposed to build phase two: dubbed the New North Building, a large, modern, six-storey structure in its place. In 2017, the campus celebrated its 50th anniversary, a milestone that coincided with Canada's sesquicentennial. Phase two of the North Building reconstruction was finished in 2018 and officially named Maanjiwe nendamowinan (an Anishinaabemowin term meaning \"gathering of minds\") in 2019 following input from the campus community and the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation . The UTM Eagles varsity program stopped competing in 2020 following the temporary suspension of OCAA athletics, and the program did not resume when the OCAA resumed competition. The program formally ceased operations following the 2021\u201322 academic year. In 2022, the Amazon Prime Video spin-off series of The Boys titled Gen V filmed its first season, with production in the Greater Toronto Area. The series, which follows students of a university for superpowered individuals, used the campus as a primary filming location. Gen V returned to U of T to film its second season in 2024. Future Beginning in the 2026\u20132027 academic year, the Lawrence Bloomberg Faculty of Nursing will begin offering its undergraduate nursing program on the Mississauga campus. This is part of the University of Toronto's mandate to expand programs in its tri-campus structure. As of 2025, a new six-storey, 116,560 square foot residence hall is under construction, expected to add 400 beds with an opening date at the start of the 2026\u20132027 year. This project is part of the 2021 Campus Master Plan to transform the Mississauga campus looking ahead to 2036. Also included in the plan are upgraded pedestrian and biking infrastructure, outdoor gathering spaces, and new academic and residence buildings. Campus grounds University of Toronto Mississauga Transit Museums/galleries Libraries Theatres Housing Open spaces Sports Campus An aerial view of the Mississauga campus facing north in 2022 The campus is an enclave of Erin Mills , a neighbourhood in west Mississauga , but considered a special purpose character area and not part of any neighbourhood. It is located between Erin Mills and Erindale on 225 acres of protected forest at the west bank of the Credit River . It is the second-largest University of Toronto campus in terms of land area. The area is roughly bounded by Mississauga Road to the southwest, Dundas Street to the southeast, Burnhamthorpe Road to the northwest and the Credit River to the northeast. The nearby suburban neighbourhood, the Mississauga Road area and the Credit Woodlands, is a fairly affluent section of the city. The UTM entrance monument In 2013, $1 million was spent on constructing a large stone monument at the entrance way to the campus, along with general repairs to nearby sidewalks, pedestrian crossings, lighting, and electrical equipment. The stone monument became the centre of a controversy, with an almost universally negative reaction from students due to what was seen as excessive expenditure and lack of student involvement in the approval process, though the university said that a student was on the committee that approved the project. Natural environment and sustainability The Wilson Pond Bridge near Lislehurst , believed to be built in the 1920s\u201330s by Reginald Watkins. The Mississauga campus is known for its close proximity to nature. The UTM Nature Trail extends from the northern end of Principal's Road near Lislehurst , a historic building used as the principal 's residence, along the river bank to the southern end of the campus. The Credit River and Erindale Park are also within walking distance of the campus. The surrounding forest is home to a variety of wildlife including Jefferson salamanders , skunks, Canada geese , and most notably deer. Families of white-tailed deer are often present in the area and frequently found roaming the campus. The deer are the subject of interest from the campus community, as social media accounts have been created for the animals, the building Deerfield Hall named for them, and a student ID card created for one given the name \"Hartley Fawn.\" The UTM campus earned Canada's first Silver Fair Trade Campus designation for the food and drink options provided on campus. Every new building at UTM since 2006 has been LEED-certified Silver or higher, and the Science Building as well as the Instructional Centre use geothermal heating . Some buildings also use reclaimed rain water in their plumbing. UTM is a Gold-certified institution under the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education's (AASHE)\u202fSustainability Tracking, Assessment, and Rating System (STARS). The University of Toronto was ranked the most sustainable university in the world in 2024 and 2025. Nature gallery Buildings See also: List of University of Toronto buildings The University of Toronto Mississauga campus consists of a small number of large academic buildings arranged within the bounds of the campus road Outer Circle. The William G. Davis Building was the first to be built, with the original intention of being a central mega-structure and the only building on the campus. It remains the largest on the campus and has undergone numerous expansions since its opening in 1973. The campus saw substantial development in the early 2000s including residence halls and numerous academic buildings which grew outward from the Davis Building. William G. Davis Building Main article: William G. Davis Building The oldest and largest building on campus, the William G. Davis Building (formerly the South Building), was built as a megalithic structure, predominantly out of concrete, as was typical of the brutalist architecture style of the late 1960s. It was one of architect Raymond Moriyama 's first major commissions. The Davis Building has since expanded along with the addition of many more buildings over the decades following an increase in enrolment at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Kaneff Centre/Innovation Complex Main article: Kaneff Centre and Innovation Complex The Rotunda in the Kaneff Centre/Innovation Complex The Innovation Complex is an expansion of the Kaneff Centre that serves as a multi-functional hub for academic, administrative, and social activities. The addition filled in the central green space within the Kaneff Centre and features a central rotunda, designed with warm-toned travertine and white oak, providing a gathering space for faculty and students which frequently hosts speaking events. It houses the Institute for Management and Innovation (IMI), which offers interdisciplinary business management education at the graduate level. The facility includes lecture rooms, behaviour research labs, and a mock trading floor, and is built to LEED Silver standards , incorporating sustainable features like a green roof and natural light harvesting. The building was designed by Moriyama & Teshima Architects and built by PCL Constructors Canada Inc. It is also the location of the campus's registrar's office. Communication, Culture and Technology Building The Communication, Culture and Technology (CCT) building, designed by Saucier + Perrot, was opened in September 2004. It is characterized by a black and glass exterior. The interior is finished in concrete and gray paint, with black plastic melamine on many surfaces. It houses the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology (ICCIT) and the MiST Theatre. Terrence Donnelly Health Sciences Complex Main article: Terrence Donnelly Health Sciences Complex The Health Sciences Complex , home to the Mississauga Academy of Medicine and Biomedical Communications Program The Mississauga Academy of Medicine is housed across two floors inside the Terrence Donnelly Health Sciences Complex. Built in 2011, the building is the home of the Temerty Faculty of Medicine on the Mississauga campus, and contains classroom spaces, seminar rooms, computer facilities, learning spaces and laboratories. Students are provided with fully equipped student lounge and outdoor terrace to relax and socialize. Students are able to share lectures and learning experiences both inside and outside the classroom through advanced technologies. Instructional Centre The construction of the Instructional Centre was spurred from the doubling of student enrolment since the early 2000s. In response to growth in enrolment during the 2000s and 2010s, the Mississauga campus expanded to meet the needs of its growing student population. The Instructional Centre (IB) had plans drawn out in 2002 and opened in 2012 as the only building on campus to be purely dedicated to lecture halls and study spaces (as well as a food and lounge area). Located next to the Hazel McCallion Academic Learning Centre on Outer Circle Road, IB covers a total of 13,000 square metres (140,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) of space spread out throughout its three stories. The building is composed of green oxidized copper strips on both the outside and inside. UTM's Instructional Centre includes geothermal heating and cooling systems under the nearby North Field as well as awnings with thin photovoltaic cells. Other renewable energy features include green roofs, reflective membranes to reduce heat as well as energy and water-efficient lighting and fixtures. The Instructional Centre shares its name with a building on the Scarborough campus with the building code IC, and thus uses IB as a distinction. The construction of the building and the Health Sciences Complex meant the loss of 450 campus parking spaces, however the buildings together accommodate up to 2,500 students simultaneously. Within the Instructional Centre are two lecture halls with the capacity to fit as many as 500 students each. Also included are study rooms and a 24/7 computer lab. The Instructional Centre was designed by Perkins+Will Canada , and won the Award of Excellence at the 30th annual Mississauga Urban Design Awards competition. Deerfield Hall Deerfield Hall, opened in 2014 Deerfield Hall is part of the New North reconstruction on the northern end of campus. It features four storeys with theatre rehearsal space, computer labs, classrooms, offices, formal and informal study space and an expanded food services area. Maanjiwe nendamowinan Main article: Maanjiwe nendamowinan Maanjiwe nendamowinan is a 220,595-square-foot, six-storey structure opened in September 2018. The LEED-certified project cost approximately $89 million. The Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation (MCFN) on whose traditional territory the campus now stands, recommended Maanjiwe nendamowinan (pronounced Mahn-ji-way nen-da-mow-in-ahn), a formally endorsed Anishinaabemowin name meaning \u201cgathering of minds.\u201d New Science Building The New Science Building, which officially opened in Fall 2024, features energy-efficient wet lab biological and chemical laboratory facilities. Designed to achieve LEED Gold certification , the building incorporates sustainable systems such as a geothermal heating and cooling system, a rooftop solar photovoltaic array, and a rainwater harvesting system. Spanning 15,550 square meters over four stories, it created new spaces for faculty and student offices, gathering and conference spaces, and a high-performance data centre. The facility is linked to the adjacent William G. Davis Building and aims to help reduce the campus's carbon footprint by 2030. North Building The former North Building, built in 1966 and demolished in 2015 to build Maanjiwe nendamowinan The North Building was the original educational building on the campus, formerly known as Erindale College. Construction for the North Building began in 1966. It was originally intended to be temporary and to be used for administrative purposes such as the registrar's office, but remained until 2015. Classes in the building began for the 1967 school year, with 155 students, 28 faculty, and 40 staff. Since then numerous additions and remodels were made. Before its demolition, the only part of the original structure that remained were the cafeteria and some classrooms on the first floor. The building was home to the Department of Humanities. Room capacities ranged from 48-person classrooms to a 200-person lecture hall and a cafe containing Coyote Jacks, Pita Pit , Tim Hortons and Mr. Sub vendors. The North Building was demolished in 2015, and replaced by Deerfield Hall and the six-storey Maanjiwe nendamowinan which opened in 2018. Administration See also: List of vice-presidents and principals of the University of Toronto Mississauga Lislehurst , the UTM principal's residence The University of Toronto Mississauga has two head administrators: the campus principal , who also serves as a vice-president of the University of Toronto, and the dean, who is also the campus vice-principal, academic.

Hailing from its origins as a constituent college, Erindale College was previously granted its own coat of arms, however it fell out of use in the early 2000s when the campus became a fully-fledged academic division and adopted its current name. The former Erindale College arms were described as follows: The colours green and gold are dominantly featured and represent the natural beauty of the campus. The oak tree is from the U of T coat of arms and the wavy blue and silver bars in the chevron signify the proximity of the campus to the Credit River . The former coat of arms included the college's motto, tantum nobis creditum , a Latin phrase meaning \"so much has been entrusted to us.\" In popular culture The U of T Mississauga campus has been used as a filming location for movies such as Downsizing (2017), which features both the UTM Library and Communication, Culture and Technology (CCT) building. TV series filmed on the campus include The Handmaid's Tale (2017\u20132025), Doc (2025\u2013 ), where Maanjiwe nendamowinan is used as Westside Hospital, and The Boys (2019\u2013 ), which used the Innovation Complex Rotunda for an interior shot of Vought Tower. Most notably, the campus is the primary filming location of The Boys' spin-off show Gen V (2023\u2013 ). In the popular Amazon Prime Video series, UTM is used as its main setting, Godolkin University, a college for superpowered individuals. In its two seasons, Gen V has predominantly featured Mississauga campus buildings such as Maanjiwe nendamowinan, the Instructional Centre, Erindale Hall, and the Hazel McCallion Academic Learning Centre.

The castle stands on an island in the lake formed by the Villerest dam. History The earliest written records of the castle date from 1260. It was built on a rocky platform overlooking the Loire river from a height of 30 metres. The fortress allowed a watch to be kept and tolls to be collected for the County of Forez border. The building suffered floods from the Loire more often than attacks from enemies. In 1290, Girard de La Roche paid homage to the Count of Forez for his house in La Roche. In the 17th century, because of repetitive floods, the castle lost its attraction, resembling more and more a fortified house that became a ruin in later centuries. At the end of the 1900s, an industrialist from Roanne bought the castle and restored it in the Gothic style, intending it as a second home. During the 1930s, the construction project for the Villerest dam by EDF condemned the ch\u00e2teau to disappear below the water. The structure degraded very quickly and was subject to numerous acts of vandalism. It was finally bought for a symbolic one franc by the commune . During the construction of the dam in 1984, the ch\u00e2teau was the only building spared by the waters. It is now situated on an island. In 1996, it was entirely restored and the side facing the water was remodelled to permit access throughout the year. The regulation of the waters of the Loire have not fully protected the ch\u00e2teau; it was affected by floodwater in 2003 and 2008. See also List of castles in France References ^ a b J.-E.

{"id": "doc_random_233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Amit", "text": "Yosef Amit ( Hebrew : \u05d9\u05d5\u05e1\u05e3 \u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05ea ; born 1945 ) is a former Israeli military intelligence major who was convicted of espionage in 1987. Amit is thought to have spied for the United States and a European NATO country, though this has never been confirmed by the Israeli government. Early life and career Amit was born in Kiryat Bialik in 1945 to Eliyahu and Tova Lizra. He was conscripted into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 1963, serving in the Paratroopers Brigade , later transferring to the Israeli Navy and graduating from the Naval Officers' School in Acre . In 1967 he left the IDF to work as a policeman, rejoining the army in 1970. Amit was wounded in a clash with Palestinian guerrillas on the Lebanese border in 1972. He worked as a military intelligence officer from the Yom Kippur War until 1979. Amit reached the rank of major , and was placed in command of a military intelligence base on the Lebanese border. He served in Unit 504 of military intelligence, whose function was to operate agents in Arab countries. During his tenure as a military intelligence officer, Amit tried to profit by selling drugs, and he was arrested for drug dealing in 1978. Prior to his court-martial, he was declared mentally unfit to stand trial. He was discharged from the IDF, and spent three years in a psychiatric hospital. Following his release, Amit studied at the University of Haifa from 1982 to 1984, when he dropped out to work as a private investigator. Amit's wife, Tzila, was a physical education teacher at the Yavnieli school in Haifa . They had two sons: Yuval and Oded. Espionage While working as a private investigator, Amit met an American naval officer whose ship had docked in Haifa at a bar in the city, and Amit told him about his experiences in Israeli intelligence. The officer informed his superiors, and a plan to recruit Amit as a spy was devised. The officer told Amit that he intended to retire from the US Navy, settle in West Germany and start a business. Amit responded that he had a wish to make good money, and suggested that they do business together, to which he agreed. Amit travelled to West Germany sometime later, where he met the officer, who introduced him to his \"friends\", who were in fact CIA officers from the U.S. Embassy in Bonn . They successfully recruited Amit as a spy. His handler was Tom Waltz, a Jewish CIA officer from the CIA station at the US embassy in Tel Aviv . Waltz instructed Amit on which kind of material was needed. Above all, the CIA was interested in Israeli troop movements and intentions in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories . Amit was also alleged to have passed classified information to an unidentified NATO country in Europe. Amit continued spying almost until his arrest. Arrest and conviction Shin Bet and the Israel Police began to suspect Amit after one of his friends reported that he had spoken of links with US intelligence. Amit was arrested in the parking lot of his Haifa apartment building on 24 March 1986. During his interrogation, he made a full confession and provided the names of individuals he had met with, as well as meeting locations and dates, and the payment he had received. When his house was searched, classified military and Shin Bet documents were found. Under questioning, Amit admitted that he had obtained the documents from a childhood friend who worked in Shin Bet, and had persuaded him to give him the documents on grounds that it would assist him in some private investigations. Amit's friend was then arrested and admitted to having given Amit the documents, but expressed remorse and denied knowing that Amit was using them for other purposes. He was subsequently sentenced to a three-month prison term and a one-year suspended sentence , and was fired from Shin Bet. After a lengthy closed trial in the Haifa District Court, Amit was sentenced to 12 years in prison in April 1987 (at the time 15 years was the maximum sentence). Israeli media was prohibited from mentioning the case by military censorship, while some inaccurate accounts appeared in the non-Israeli press. Prison term Amit served his sentence in Ayalon Prison , a maximum-security prison in Ramla . According to a television report, he was held in the prison's psychiatric ward and was allowed visits, while other sources claimed that he was held in solitary confinement for many years. Yossi Melman wrote in Haaretz in 2021 that Amit was severely tortured in prison, including hospitalization and electric shock treatments in the Mizra mental health hospital near Acre , and his family suffered threats and harassment. The Israeli Supreme Court rejected an appeal by him in 1989. The case was kept secret on security grounds until June 1993, when the Israeli government allowed the publication of Amit's name, conviction, and sentence in response to a petition from the publishers of Haaretz . At one point, Israeli officials considered offering to exchange Amit for Jonathan Pollard , a US naval intelligence analyst who had spied for Israel and had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 1987. However, when Amit heard of this, he sent a letter to the State Attorney's Office, stating that he had no desire to be any part of such an exchange, and claimed that his confession had been extracted illegally. In 1990, while still in prison, Amit sued Yedioth Ahronoth and Maariv for libel over articles those papers had published in 1986 stating that an IDF intelligence major had been convicted of spying for Syria . Although the articles didn't mention Amit by name, Amit contended in his suit that prison guards and fellow inmates had formed the connection, and the false accusation that he had spied for Israel's worst enemy had severely hurt his reputation and led other prisoners to harass him. Like Amit's trial, this case was kept secret until June 1993. Amit dropped the suit in June 1993 after the papers agreed to publish corrections. During Amit's imprisonment, his father, who died a year before he was released, made repeated unsuccessful attempts to have more details on the case publicized. In October 1993, Amit was released from prison after serving two-thirds of his sentence. Some sources maintain that he was pardoned by President Ezer Weizman . He was paroled on grounds of good behavior, even though he had often violated prison regulations, and also due to psychological considerations.

{"id": "doc_random_234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Thomson_(film_critic)", "text": "This article is about the American-based film critic. For the British-based film and television producer, see David M. Thompson . David Thomson (born 18 February 1941) is a British film critic and historian based in the United States, and the author of more than 20 books. His reference works in particular\u00a0\u2013 Have You Seen...?: A Personal Introduction to 1,000 Films (2008) and The New Biographical Dictionary of Film (6th edition, 2014)\u00a0\u2013 have been praised as works of high literary merit and eccentricity despite some criticism for self-indulgence. Benjamin Schwarz , writing in The Atlantic Monthly , called him \"probably the greatest living film critic and historian\" who \"writes the most fun and enthralling prose about the movies since Pauline Kael \". John Banville called him \"the greatest living writer on the movies\" and Michael Ondaatje said he \"is our most argumentative and trustworthy historian of the screen.\" In 2010, The New Biographical Dictionary of Film was named the greatest book on the cinema by a poll in Sight and Sound ; his novel Suspects also received multiple votes. Guillermo Cabrera Infante of The New Republic wrote \"Thomson is the Dr. Johnson of film.\" Biography Thomson was born in London . He was admitted to Oxford but attended the London School of Film Technique. He taught film studies at Dartmouth College , and has been a regular contributor to The New York Times , Film Comment , Movieline , The New Republic , and Salon . Thomson has served on the selection committee for the New York Film Festival , and scripted an award-winning documentary, The Making of a Legend: Gone with the Wind . In 1975, he published A Biographical Dictionary of Cinema , now in its sixth edition as The New Biographical Dictionary of Film . Thomson helped to revive interest in the director Michael Powell (along with Emeric Pressburger , one half of the film duo the Archers .) Roger Ebert writes: \"Powell was rescued from obscurity and relative poverty first by the film critic David Thomson, whose Biographical Dictionary of Film contained a glowing entry about the director. Powell wrote thanking Thomson, who invited him to teach at Dartmouth College. The trip to America led to Powell's meeting Martin Scorsese , a devotee of the Archers films since he was eleven or twelve years old, and Scorsese's editor, Thelma Schoonmaker , who eventually became Powell's wife.\" Thomson recalls: \"Michael was very interested in trying to do a film from a novel by Ursula Le Guin . He said, 'Why don\u2019t we do an extract from that film??' We did so, and we shot it on 35mm. He came to campus in the winter of 1980, arriving in a pink Harris tweed suit. He was, you know, a great, eccentric character. He possessed absolute assurance. He was not really interested in the academic process per se, but I think he knew that if he acted the way he wanted, bright students would learn a great deal from it, which is really what happened. They shot an extract, and it was an amazing time. We also ran a series of his films, and he began writing his autobiography while he was at Dartmouth. His presence on campus was a major event in the lives of people who went on to big careers, like Chris Meledandri of Illumination . Meledandri actually made a film about Michael at Dartmouth, a short documentary.\" In 1985, Thomson published Suspects , a metafictional novel that imagines the secret histories of film noir characters like Sunset Boulevard 's Norma Desmond and Chinatown 's Noah Cross. Charles Champlin called Suspects \"the wildest and most imaginative use of the movies as material I have ever read.\" Graham Fuller named it one of his favorite books on film, saying \"Thomson was a historian writing like a novelist and so it was logical that he would eventually weave fiction with history in the serpentine Suspects , from which one can learn more about the iconography of film noir than from many worthy textbooks.\" In 1990, he followed it with Silver Light , which mixes real and fictional people from the history of the Western ; Publishers Weekly notes that the \u201ccast includes Willa Cather , Montgomery Clift , Charles Ives , Judge Roy Bean and numerous characters smuggled in from such movies as The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and McCabe & Mrs. Miller . Thomson has written screenplays, including Fierce Heat , which was to be produced by Martin Scorsese and directed by Stephen Frears . He recalls \"I wrote a script for Scorsese, which was a very enjoyable experience. It didn\u2019t get made, although I think it helped lead him to Casino . It was about Las Vegas , which my wife and I love and is a totally insane, very American place.\" With Ian Christie , Thomson edited Scorsese on Scorsese (1989), a book of conversations with Scorsese. He went on to edit Levinson on Levinson (1992), a book of conversations with Barry Levinson . In 1997, he wrote about The Big Sleep for the British Film Institute Classics series. Thomson has written several biographies, notably Rosebud: The Story of Orson Welles (1996). Thomson has written books that combine biography and fiction, such as Warren Beatty and Desert Eyes (1987), which combines a biography of Warren Beatty with speculative fiction. Publishers Weekly wrote that \"Thomson's analysis of Beatty's work is perceptive\" but criticized the \"silly futuristic story of a California peopled with earthquake survivors.\" Champlin called the book \"stunning and unprecedented.\" He has also written a controversial book about Nicole Kidman , which Peter Conrad wrote \"slithers from critical observation to subjunctive daydreaming\", including ventures into \"territory best left to pornography.\" Lawrence Levi called it a \"weird and unseemly mash note.\" In The New Biographical Dictionary of Film , Thomson memorializes his friend Kieran Hickey , a documentary filmmaker. Thomson wrote some of Hickey's films, including Faithful Departed , a short documentary on the Dublin of James Joyce 's Ulysses . Thomson credits Hickey with shaping his book: \"I do not mean to shift the responsibility. Kieran helped in the research on all editions of this book; he commented and improved it at every page. But his deepest contribution was to the years of talk, the climate of taking pictures seriously, that made me think this book possible. If you feel the urge to talk back to this book, then know that Kieran paved the way.\" Hickey died in 1993, and Thomson writes that \"in a way I feel the movies are over now that he's gone.\" He has confessed that he prefers writing books to film writing. Thomson lives in San Francisco with his wife and sons. In 2014, the San Francisco International Film Festival announced that Thomson would receive the Mel Novikoff Award at their 57th annual festival. This is given to those making significant contributions to the Bay Area's film community. He has turned his interest to television, writing Breaking Bad: The Official Book (2015) and Television: A Biography (2016). Favorite films Thomson participated in the Sight and Sound poll in 2002, 2012 and 2022. In 2002, he prefaced his list with a \"Love You, Too\" to Sunrise , The Passenger , The Umbrellas of Cherbourg , In a Lonely Place , L'Atalante , Madame de... , The Red Shoes , Point Blank , Persona , The Lady Eve , The Awful Truth , The Shop Around the Corner , Rear Window , Meet Me in St. Louis , Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid , The Night of the Hunter , The Eclipse , Providence , Belle de Jour , Chinatown , Mulholland Drive and \"just about everything by Howard Hawks except the one I will come to, eventually\" before naming his top ten. 2002: Blue Velvet , Celine and Julie Go Boating , Citizen Kane , The Conformist , His Girl Friday , A Man Escaped , The Rules of the Game , Pierrot le Fou , That Obscure Object of Desire and Ugetsu Monogatari . 2012: Blue Velvet , Celine and Julie Go Boating , Citizen Kane , The Conformist , Hiroshima mon amour , His Girl Friday , Pierrot le Fou , The Rules of the Game , The Shop Around the Corner and Ugetsu Monogatari . 2022: The Big Sleep , Celine and Julie Go Boating , Citizen Kane , Fists in the Pocket , Magnolia , A Man Escaped , Pierrot le Fou , The Shop Around the Corner , The Underground Railroad and The Vietnam War .

{"id": "doc_random_236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parbat_(film)", "text": "Parbat ( Hindi for \"The Mountain\") is a 1952 Bollywood film starring Nutan , Prem Nath , K. N. Singh and Purnima . The film was produced and distributed by Varma Films and directed by O.P. Dutta . Central to the plot of Parbat is the issue of obsessive love. As recognized by Levitan and Warner, \u201cmovies about obsession definitely have an allure\u2014it's that mixture of excitement and terror, similar to the suspense of a quality scary movie.\u201d While movies about obsessive love have always been popular, Parbat \u2019s notability in dealing with this issue arises from the remarkable cast and crew of the film. For example, Nutan, the female lead of the film and the object of obsessive love, held the record of five wins of the Best Actress at Filmfare for over 3 decades. As noted by Dhawan \u201cThrough her path-breaking roles, Nutan endeavored to change the mindset of the audience about the place of women in our society. She was a pioneer in the depiction of women, particularly, tortured and tormented women, on the screen.\u201d K.N. Singh who plays the person in obsessive love, was a noteworthy and scary villain. In his own words, \"Even off-screen I was a bad man. One day on my way back from shooting, I had to deliver an envelope at an address given to me by my friend. I pressed the doorbell and, from the moving curtains, I could see a woman hurrying to open the door. When she saw me standing in front of her, she screamed out in fright and ran inside leaving the door open.\u201d Finally, O.P. Dutta, the movie's director, was the director for as many as 9 movies during his career. In his sample of the careers of 3129 movie directors, De Vany (2003) finds that 1990 out of 3129 (63%) directors made only one movie, and only 23 out of 3129 (less than 1%) directors made 9 movies. With O.P. Dutta \u2019s career including 9 movies as a director, the above comparison benchmark is an indicator of his remarkable directorial ability. Parbat joins the ranks of lost films , with no surviving copies, but its musical soul persists in the form of audio tracks \u2014an indispensable factor in the box-office success of Indian films. Also, some film stills of Parbat still survive and are available from the external links below and elsewhere. Plot Nutan and Premnath in Parbat Nestled high in the rugged peaks of a remote mountain range, a picturesque village becomes the backdrop for a poignant tale of love, duty, and sacrifice. The film unfolds against this landscape, where ancient traditions and modern aspirations collide, shaping the destinies of its central characters. At the heart of this narrative is Parbat, a vivacious young woman who is the darling of the village. Her life, seemingly predestined to follow the well-worn paths of her ancestors, takes an unexpected turn when she encounters Pahari, a charming and courageous mountain guide. Pahari, with his rugged good looks and deep understanding of the mountains, captivates Parbat's heart. Their conversations, filled with shared dreams and stolen glances, hint at the promise of a shared future. K. N. Singh in Parbat However, the idyllic romance is abruptly threatened by the return of Singh, a wealthy, older man whose obsession with Parbat casts a long, ominous shadow over the village. Singh's history with Parbat is fraught with unwanted advances and thinly veiled threats, setting the stage for a conflict that will test the strength of her newfound love. His return brings with it a palpable tension, as the villagers, aware of his influence and power, tread carefully around him. Singh, emboldened by his wealth and status, wastes no time in employing his considerable influence to drive a wedge between Parbat and Pahari. He manipulates local authorities, threatens Pahari's livelihood, and even attempts to buy the loyalty of Parbat's family. These machinations create obstacles that seem insurmountable, forcing Parbat and Pahari to question the viability of their relationship in the face of such formidable opposition. Purnima in Parbat The conflict intensifies as Pahari's family, fearing Singh's power and influence, succumbs to pressure and arranges a marriage between Pahari and Naina, a sweet and gentle woman from their village. This arrangement plunges Pahari into a deep moral quandary, torn between his passionate love for Parbat and his sense of duty to his family and traditions. Parbat, upon learning of the arranged marriage, is left heartbroken. She attempts to move on, throwing herself into her work and community responsibilities, but her lingering feelings for Pahari remain a constant undercurrent in her life. The film skillfully portrays her internal conflict, showcasing moments of quiet despair juxtaposed with her determination to find happiness despite her circumstances. Naina, the third point in this emotional triangle, is not oblivious to the situation she finds herself in. Aware of Pahari's true affections, she struggles with her own feelings of inadequacy and sadness. Her character evolves throughout the narrative, from a passive participant in an arranged marriage to a woman grappling with complex emotions and her own desires for genuine love and companionship. The resolution of the story offers a nuanced exploration of love's many forms and the difficult choices we sometimes must make in its name. As the final scenes unfold, the audience is left to explore the enduring power of love to transform lives, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.

Singh Purnima as Naina Ulhas Raj Mehra Shobhna Samarth Soundtrack Music was composed by Shankar\u2013Jaikishan , while Hasrat Jaipuri and Shailendra wrote the lyrics.

{"id": "doc_random_237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GWR_autocoach", "text": "The GWR autocoach (or auto-trailer ) is a type of coach that was used by the Great Western Railway for push-pull trains powered by a steam locomotive . The distinguishing design feature of an autocoach is the driving cab at one end, allowing the driver to control the train without needing to be located in the cab of the steam locomotive. This eliminates the need to run the engine round to the other end of the coach at the end of each journey. When one or more autocoaches are connected to a suitably equipped steam locomotive, the combination is known as an autotrain , or, historically, a railmotor train . A steam locomotive provided with the equipment to be used as an autotrain is said to be auto-fitted . The autocoach is the forerunner of the driving trailer used with push\u2013pull trains . Design features Retractable steps for use at low platforms A locomotive fitted with additional control equipment is used to power the autotrain. When running 'autocoach first', the regulator is operated by a linkage to a rotating shaft running the length of the locomotive, passing below the cab floor. This engages (via a telescopic coupling) with another shaft running the full length below the floor of the autocoach. This shaft is turned by a second regulator lever in the cab of the autocoach. (See photograph sequence below.) The driver can operate the regulator, brakes and whistle from the far (cab) end of the autocoach; the fireman remains on the locomotive and (in addition to firing) also controls the valve gear settings. The driver can also warn of the train's approach using a large mechanical gong, prominently mounted high on the cab end of the autocoach, which is operated by stamping on a pedal on the floor of the cab. The driver, guard and fireman communicate with each other by an electric bell system. The lever above the cab window moves a vertical rod... ...which rotates the long rod beneath the coach... ...to turn the flat bar at the back of the coach... ...that engages with the socket on the locomotive to operate the regulator. In operation The non-driving end of preserved W225 in British Railways livery on the South Devon Railway If more than one autocoach was used, the locomotive would usually be marshalled between the coaches, as 'play' in the control linkages could otherwise make operation difficult. This arrangement was not always possible where turntables were not convenient for turning coaches and hence up to two autocoaches could follow or lead a locomotive with cab ends away from the locomotive. Many GWR suburban services around Plymouth were formed of fixed autotrain formations of four autocoaches, two each side of the locomotive with cabs leading in each direction. When these were introduced in 1906, experiments were made to harmonise the appearance of the locomotive in the middle of the train by cutting down the side tanks and encasing the entire locomotive in a square bodyshell of the same basic design, height and width as the coaches, complete with 'windows' and the same chocolate/cream paint livery. Two 2021 Class and two 517 Class engines were modified in this way. Accidents and incidents On 15 April 1923, carriage No. 70 formed a passenger train hauled by locomotive No. 215. The train was in a head-on collision with a freight train at Curry Rivel , Somerset due to a signalman's error. Nine people were injured. On 16 November 1937, an empty train in a siding at the eastern end of Ealing Broadway station (between platforms 2 and 3) was waiting to be called into the platform to form the next service to Denham when the driver started the train in thick fog without noticing that the points were not set for the platform nor that the signals were against him, and the auto-trailer crashed into the signal box . This auto-trailer, no. 211 of Diagram A 31 , had been converted in August 1935 from steam rail motor no. 81 (Diagram Q 1 ); it was repaired after the accident, and was not withdrawn until March 1959.

{"id": "doc_random_238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyway_That_I_Can", "text": "\" Everyway That I Can \" (also spelled as \" Every Way That I Can \") is a song by Turkish singer Sertab Erener , with music composed by herself and Demir Demirkan , lyrics written by Demirkan, and production and arrangement by Ozan \u00c7olako\u011flu . It represented Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 , held in Riga , winning the contest. It was the first entry from Turkey in the contest that did not feature any Turkish lyrics. It went on to achieve commercial success throughout Europe, peaking at number one on singles charts of Greece , Sweden , and Turkey , as well as attaining top-10 peaks in Austria , Belgium , the Netherlands , Romania , and Spain . It continues to be ranked among the best Eurovision entries. Background Conception \"Everyway That I Can\" was composed by Sertab Erener and Demir Demirkan with lyrics by Demirkan. Erener recorded it with production and arrangement by Ozan \u00c7olako\u011flu , famous for his works with pop idol Tarkan . She recorded two versions of the song, one fully in English, and another with Turkish and English lyrics. Eurovision The Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) internally selected Erener as its performer for the 48th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest . On 24 February 2003, TRT announced \"Everyway That I Can\" as the Turkish entry for the contest. Initially the song caused controversy with the Turkish public, considered too racy by some and too pop -oriented by others. Criticism also arose by Erener's decision to perform it fully in English at Eurovision. A promo video was released with Erener in an Ottoman style castle, its rose gardens, imperial harem (living quarters) and Turkish Bath (hamam). Roses carry a major symbolism throughout the video. Erener is dressed in traditional Turkish styles, and Turkish female dancers are also present. With its selection of singer and song, Turkey was regarded as having \"set out to win\" the contest, but Erener was not widely regarded as a front-runner in the lead-up to the event; \" Ne Ver', Ne Boysia \" by t.A.T.u. for Russia was regarded as a favorite to win. On 24 May 2003, the Eurovision Song Contest was held in the Skonto Hall in Riga hosted by Latvian Television (LTV) and broadcast live throughout the continent. Erener performed \"Everyway That I Can\" fourth on the evening, earning critical acclaim and becoming the only entry that received a standing ovation . The song had been slightly arranged to include some high notes and a belly dancing routine was added. Erener sang counter to the rhythm in places and the backing vocals were synthesised with Turkish stringed instruments . The voting on the night saw Russia, Turkey, and Belgium switch places at the top a number of times before Slovenia eventually gave Turkey the victory by two points; the song received the maximum 12 points from four countries, the second-highest number (following Russia). After Eurovision Erener was hailed in Turkey as a national hero by the public and the press and was congratulated by the President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan . She was awarded the State Medal of Distinguished Service , among others. Additionally, this success was celebrated as a step forward in the Turkey\u2013European Union relations . As the winning broadcaster, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) gave TRT the responsibility to host the following edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. Erener performed \"Everyway That I Can\" with male dancers and the same choreography as part of a medley at the Eurovision final in Istanbul on 15 May 2004. The single was also included in her first English album No Boundaries . The song continues to perform well in rankings of the all-time best Eurovision entries. On 22 October 2005, the song competed in Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest as one of the fourteen best ever Eurovision entrants, and finished ninth. Erener herself appeared onstage to perform the final verse of the song. In 2006, it was entered in Die Grand Prix Hitliste , a German version of the above, and beat off stiff competition from \" Waterloo \" by ABBA and eleven others to finish second. \" Wild Dances \" by Ruslana the Ukrainian 2004 winning entry, was first. The song was also included in a compilation album of Erener's national and international hits released in 2007. On 9 May 2024, Erener performed the song as part of a sing-along interval act in the second semi-final of the 2024 contest held in Malm\u00f6 , Sweden. Charts performance Following its win, \"Everyway That I Can\" was released throughout Europe and sold well. It reached the top of the charts in Turkey, Greece, and Eastern Europe , holding the number-one position in Sweden for three weeks, breaking the top ten in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, and Austria and charting within the top twenty in Germany and Switzerland. It received a platinum certification in Greece and a gold certification in Sweden. Remixes of the song were also released, including a Turkish version, a club remix, and a European dance remix. A live version was brought out and also included on the original single CD , along with two Galleon club remixes. The track was included on the official Eurovision 2003 CD as the original version, however. Certifications Legacy In 2010, Elhaida Dani performed the song live on E diela Shqiptare , an Albanian variety show. Dani would later go on to represent Albania at the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 .

The entirety of the County is incorporated in the Shire of Bulloo with the seat of local government being located at Thargomindah . The County is remote, arid and flat like much of the channel country. The county is divided into civil parishes. History Prior to colonisation the area the County now lies on was traditional land of the Karnic tribes . The county came into existence in the 19th century, but on 8 March 1901, when the Governor of Queensland issued a proclamation legally dividing Queensland into counties under the Land Act 1897. Like all counties in Queensland, it is a non-functional administrative unit, that is used mainly for the purpose of registering land titles. From 30 November 2015, the government no longer referenced counties and parishes in land information systems however the Museum of Lands, Mapping and Surveying retains a record for historical purposes.

{"id": "doc_random_242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Detective_Fiction", "text": "Cover of The Mysterious Affair at Styles , the first book featuring Hercule Poirot , by Agatha Christie The Golden Age of Detective Fiction was an era of classic murder mystery novels of similar patterns and styles, predominantly in the 1920s and 1930s. While the Golden Age proper is usually taken to refer to works from that period, this type of fiction has been written since at least 1911 and is still being written. In his history of the detective story, Bloody Murder: From the Detective Story to the Crime Novel , the author Julian Symons heads two chapters devoted to the Golden Age as \"the Twenties\" and \"the Thirties\". Symons notes that Philip Van Doren Stern's article, \"The Case of the Corpse in the Blind Alley\" (1941), \"could serve ... as an obituary for the Golden Age.\" Authors Agatha Christie , Dorothy L. Sayers , Margery Allingham , and Ngaio Marsh have been collectively called the Queens of Crime . Description of the genre Certain conventions and clich\u00e9s were established that limited any surprises on the part of the reader to the details of the plot and, primarily, to the identity of the murderer. The majority of novels of that era were \" whodunits \", and several authors excelled, after misleading their readers successfully, in revealing the least likely suspect convincingly as the villain. There was also a predilection for certain casts of characters and certain settings in a secluded English country house and its upper-class inhabitants (although they were generally landed gentry ; not aristocracy with their country house as a second house). The rules of the game \u2013 and Golden Age mysteries were considered games \u2013 were codified in 1929 by Ronald Knox . According to Knox, a detective story \"must have as its main interest the unravelling of a mystery; a mystery whose elements are clearly presented to the reader at an early stage in the proceedings, and whose nature is such as to arouse curiosity, a curiosity which is gratified at the end.\" Knox's \"Ten Commandments\", also known as \"Knox Decalogue\", are as follows: The criminal must be mentioned in the early part of the story, but must not be anyone whose thoughts the reader has been allowed to know. All supernatural or preternatural agencies are ruled out as a matter of course. Not more than one secret room or passage is allowable. No hitherto undiscovered poisons may be used, nor any appliance which will need a long scientific explanation at the end. No Chinaman must figure in the story. No accident must ever help the detective, nor must he ever have an unaccountable intuition which proves to be right. The detective himself must not commit the crime. The detective is bound to declare any clues which he may discover. The \"sidekick\" of the detective, the Watson, must not conceal from the reader any thoughts which pass through his mind: his intelligence must be slightly, but very slightly, below that of the average reader. Twin brothers, and doubles generally, must not appear unless we have been duly prepared for them. A similar but more detailed list of prerequisites was prepared by S. S. Van Dine in an article entitled \"Twenty Rules for Writing Detective Stories\", which appeared in The American Magazine in September 1928. They are commonly referred to as Van Dine's Commandments. Decline in popularity The outbreak of the Second World War is often taken as a beginning of the end for the light-hearted, straightforward \"whodunit\" of the Golden Age. As Ian Ousby writes, the Golden Age \"was a long time a-dying. Indeed, one could argue that it still is not dead, since its mannerisms have proved stubbornly persistent in writers one might have expected to abandon them altogether as dated, or worse. Yet the Second World War marked a significant close, just as the First World War had marked a significant beginning.\" He further writes: \"Even by the 1930s its assumptions were being challenged. ... Where it had once been commonplace to view the Golden Age as a high watermark of achievement, it became equally the fashion to denounce it. It had, so the indictment ran, followed rules which trivialized its subject. It had preferred settings which expressed a narrow, if not deliberately elitist, vision of society. And for heroes it had created detectives at best two-dimensional, at worst tiresome.\" Attacks on the genre were made by the influential writer and critic Julian Symons , who was dismissive of postwar detective fiction in Bloody Murder , Edmund Wilson (\"Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?\"), and Raymond Chandler (\" The Simple Art of Murder \"). Len Deighton wrote the spy thriller The IPCRESS File to be \"ragged and untidy, as life is\", and an inversion of \"the detective novels of the Thirties\". In sheer number of sales\u2014particularly those of Agatha Christie\u2014modern detective fiction has never approached the popularity of Golden Age writing. David Lehman writes: \"Every so often somebody reprises Edmund Wilson's famous put-down of detective novels, 'Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?' Wilson regarded the genre as terminally subliterary, either an addiction or a harmless vice on a par with crossword puzzles. But the truth is that for every Edmund Wilson who resists the genre there are dozens of intellectuals who have embraced it wholeheartedly. The enduring highbrow appeal of the detective novel ... is one of the literary marvels of the century.\" Enduring influence Current writing influenced by the Golden Age style is often referred to as \" cosy \" mystery writing, as distinct from the \" hardboiled \" style popular in the United States. Recent writers working in this style include Sarah Caudwell , Ruth Dudley Edwards , Peter Lovesey and Simon Brett . Television series that emulate the style include Murder, She Wrote and Midsomer Murders . Films and TV series based on the classic Golden Age novels continue to be produced. In 1930, a group of British Golden Age authors came together to form the Detection Club . In addition to meeting for dinners and helping each other with technical aspects of their work, the members agreed to adhere to Knox's Commandments. Anthony Berkeley was instrumental in setting up the club, and G. K. Chesterton was its first president. In 2015, Martin Edwards became the club's ninth president. The Country house mystery was a popular genre of English detective fiction in the 1920s and 1930s; set in the residences of the gentry and often involving a murder in a country house temporarily isolated by a snowstorm or similar with the suspects all at a weekend house party. The board game Cluedo ( Clue in North America) relies on the structure of the country house mystery. From the late 1980s to the early 1990s, not a few mystery writers who were influenced by the Golden Age style made their debut one after another in Japan. They are referred to as \"new traditionalists\" ( \u65b0\u672c\u683c\u30df\u30b9\u30c6\u30ea\u4f5c\u5bb6 , shin honkaku misuteri sakka ; lit. new orthodox mystery writers) or \"new orthodox school\" ( \u65b0\u672c\u683c\u6d3e , shin honkaku ha ) . Representative \"new traditionalists\" include writers such as Yukito Ayatsuji , Gosho Aoyama , Rintaro Norizuki and Taku Ashibe . Popular authors Most of the authors of the Golden Age were British or Irish. Some American authors had a more hard-boiled style.

Knox explained: \"I see no reason in the nature of things why a Chinaman should spoil a detective story. But as a matter of fact, if you are turning over the pages of an unknown romance in a bookstore, and come across some mention of the narrow, slit-like eyes of Chin Loo, avoid that story; it is bad.\" References ^ Stern, Philip Van Doren (1941). \"The Case of the Corpse in the Blind Alley\".

{"id": "doc_random_243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numb_(Pet_Shop_Boys_song)", "text": "\"Bright Young Things (song)\" redirects here. For the Jesus Jones song, see International Bright Young Thing . \" Numb \" is a song by Diane Warren recorded by English synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys on their ninth studio album, Fundamental (2006). It was released on 16 October 2006 as the album's third and final single, peaking at number 23 on the UK Singles Chart . Up to that point, it was only the duo's second single in 39 releases to miss the UK top 20 (the other being \" Was It Worth It? \" from 1991, which peaked at number 24). Composition Composed by American songwriter Diane Warren, known for many commercial radio-friendly hits, \"Numb\" was originally procured by the Pet Shop Boys to be one of the new singles on the 2003 compilation PopArt: The Hits . The song was previously offered to Aerosmith , whose song \" I Don't Want to Miss a Thing \" was written by Warren, but they turned it down. The Pet Shop Boys recorded a demo of \"Numb\" in 2003 but decided to save it for Fundamental . The album version, produced by Trevor Horn , opens with a dramatic orchestral intro, arranged by Steve Sidwell. Warren wrote the song about the death of her mother. The Pet Shop Boys' interpretation alludes to the desire to sequester oneself from distressing news in the modern world. Within the context of Fundamental , the song has been interpreted as a reaction to terrorism after 9/11 . Cover art The cover photo was taken by Sam Taylor-Wood at the Jerusalem Tavern in Clerkenwell , London. It shows Pet Shop Boys wearing plague doctor masks that were bought in Venice . Music video The music video for \"Numb\" was directed by Julian Gibbs, Julian House, and Chris Sayer, who, as reported by the band's official site, describe it as inspired by \"Russian constructivist cinema\". Gibbs had previously directed a 2005 BBC television adaptation of The Snow Queen , which Sayer worked on as animation director . In addition, the Gibbs and House pair have previously directed music videos for Primal Scream , Luke Slater , and Doves . Release The Pet Shop Boys website announced the release of a new radio edit of \"Numb\" as the third single from Fundamental , accompanied by new songs \"Party Song\" and \"Bright Young Things\" as B-sides . \"Bright Young Things\" was written and recorded in 2003 with co-production by Chris Zippel. It was originally intended for a film of the same title made by Stephen Fry but film producers turned down the track. A new remix of \"Psychological\" by Ewan Pearson was included on the limited-edition 12-inch release, and the two-track CD1 single included a live version of \" West End Girls \", which was recorded by BBC Radio 2 at the Mermaid Theatre in May 2006. This live track is also featured on the Pet Shop Boys' first live album, Concrete which was released the week following this single in October 2006. The single peaked at number 23 on the UK Singles Chart , becoming the duo's second most unsuccessful single at the time in terms of chart placement, after \" Was It Worth It? \" (#24 in 1991). Usage in other media BBC used the song as the closing montage following England's defeat to Portugal in the 2006 World Cup quarter-final.

{"id": "doc_random_245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haathkadi_(1995_film)", "text": "Hathkadi ( transl. \u2009Handcuffs ) is a 1995 Hindi -language action film directed by T. Rama Rao starring Govinda , Shilpa Shetty and Shakti Kapoor . The film was an average grosser in Big Cities in North India but a big hit in small cities and villages in North India. Lekar Tujhko Jaaonga Dulhan song was very popular and also responsible for its box office success in small centres in North India. Plot Assistant Commissioner of Police, Suraj Chauhan, is an honest and diligent police officer. These qualities in him are instilled in him due to the presence of corrupt politicians and police officers like the Home Minister Bhavani Shankar, Suraj's Deputy Inspector General. Suraj has a brother, who is a crime reporter for the Indian Times. Home Minister Bhavani Shankar goes to a function held by an adoption center for orphan girls. There, he encounters a pretty girl and instantly feels infatuated with her. He asks the DIG to ask the Mayor's wife to bring her to him, since the Mayor's wife is the owner of the adoption center. At first, the Mayor's wife resists and says no, but when the DIG threatens to tell the truth about her past endeavours in dealing with prostitutes to her husband, she agrees. That night, when the Mayor's wife brings the girl to Bhavani Shankar, little does he know that Arun is on an assignment for his newspaper. Arun discovers and records a video of Bhavani Shankar raping the same girl from the adoption center. The next night, Arun goes to see the Mayor, only to show him the misdeed that Home Minister Bhavani Shankar has committed. Filled with anger and disgust, the Mayor and Arun head to the police department to have Home Minister Bhavani Shankar arrested for this. But unfortunately, the Mayor's wife overhears them and informs the DIG about this. On the way to the police station, Arun and the Mayor are blocked and then ruthlessly killed by Chakku Pande ( Puneet Issar ), a special hired goon of Bhavani Shankar. Suraj is enraged and aggrieved at the loss of his brother and swears to avenge his death. As Suraj finally starts coming more in contact with Bhavani Shankar, he realises his bad character and that Bhavani Shankar is the one behind his brother's killing. After that, Suraj goes to Chakku Pande to get him to confess to the killing he did, according to the order given by Bhavani Shankar. But Chakku Pande denies it and thus is beaten up by Suraj. Chakku Pande gets sent to jail by Suraj until he decides to confess to his crime. Then one night, Bhavani Shankar hires a few goons to have Chakku Pande killed. But Chakku Pande survives due to Suraj and the police and claims he will protest against Bhavani Shankar. To Suraj's surprise, when he takes Chakku Pande to a huge public function to confess this truth, Chakku Pande puts the blame on Suraj. After that, the lights go out, and a gunshot is heard. When the lights come back on, Chakku Pande is dead, and a possible suspect is seen running away through the crowd by Suraj. Presuming that Suraj is the killer (which he is not), the evil police officers of Bhavani Shankar arrest Suraj and send him to jail for the murder of Chakku Pande. But when he reaches jail, he is surprised to see that he has a lookalike, Rajnikant. Rajnikant is a simple man with strong positive morals who came to jail because he killed a man who tried to rape his wife. And when Rajnikant realises that the evil politicians put Suraj in jail in the first place, he suggests that Suraj and Rajnikant can switch places so that Suraj can leave as Rajnikant, since Rajnikant's sentence is almost over. And from here starts a fun and action-filled story of how Suraj and Rajnikant join forces to finally accomplish Suraj's goal of avenging his brother.

He was Minister of Justice and Police between 1973 and 1977. After the independence of Suriname , he became the first Minister of Defence and served until 1977. He was one of the victims of the December murders . Biography Hoost studied at the Law School in Suriname with Hugo Pos and Harold Riedewald . In 1970, together with Eddy Bruma and Roy Adama, he founded the trade union Centrale-47 (C-47), after mass strikes in 1969, demanded a new and more progressive type of labor organization. C-47 became largest trade union in Suriname, after the Mother Union , a trade union closely connected with the National Party of Suriname . In 1973, Hoost became Minister of Justice and Police in the first National Party Combination (NPK I) cabinet, headed by Henck Arron , on behalf of the Nationalist Republican Party (PNR). The primary agenda of the PNR was the preparation of Suriname for independence. Once in government, negotiations started with the Dutch government headed by Prime Minister Joop den Uyl . Hoost was part of Surinamese delegation to negotiate the exit out of the Kingdom of the Netherlands . From 1954 until independence, Suriname was, like the Netherlands and the Netherlands Antilles , officially an equal partner within the Kingdom of the Netherlands , but foreign affairs and defense were kingdom affairs. As the Justice minister, Hoost was responsible for the transition of the Netherlands Armed Forces in Suriname (TRIS) into the Surinamese Armed Forces (SKM). After independence on 25 November 1975, Hoost became the first Minister of Defence. During the electoral campaign for the 1977 elections, the PNR ended co-operation with the NPS. In 1980, a military coup took place in Suriname under the leadership of D\u00e9si Bouterse . In 1981, Hoost, together with other former ministers of the NPK I and II, were arrested on charges of corruption. The detainees were tortured and eventually released without a fair trial. He was finally released in 1982. On 11 March 1982, army officers Surendre Rambocus , Jiwansingh Sheombar and Wilfred Hawker staged a counter-coup. The insurgency failed and Hawker was executed, while Rambocus and others were arrested. Hoost, together with the lawyers John Baboeram and Harold Riedewald, took on the defense of Rambocus at his court-martial. On 3 December the court sentenced Rambocus to 12 years in prison with forced labour. In the early morning of 8 December 1982, Hoost, Baboeram, Riedewald and 11 others were arrested and imprisoned in Fort Zeelandia , while Rambocus and Sheombar were transferred from the Memre Boekoe barracks , Santo Boma prison to Fort Zeelandia. An undisclosed number of individuals were executed, including Hoost. The only survivor was trade union leader Fred Derby , who was freed. Hoost is buried at the Mariusrust cemetery. Hoost was married. He was father of three daughters and one son. Notes ^ a b c d \"Eddy Hoost\" . Decembermoorden (in Dutch) .

Location Transmission site on the Schnitzersberg, 1.5 km south of the Ellenbogen The Ellenbogen rises between the villages of Oberweid , Frankenheim and Reichenhausen in the Rh\u00f6n Biosphere Reserve , and belongs to the municipality of Oberweid . As with most of the Rh\u00f6n Mountains its summit is more of a gently curving plateau. Near its highest point are the dwellings of Eisenacher Haus and Th\u00fcringer Rh\u00f6nhaus . From the hill summit there is a good view over the Hohe Rh\u00f6n (\"High Rh\u00f6n\"), the Milseburg and the Wasserkuppe , the latter being the highest mountain in the range. One and a half kilometres south of the Ellenbogen, the Ellenbogen Plateau climbs to a small rise that is 2 metres higher than the official summit. This rise is the 815.5 m high Schnitzersberg , which is the highest mountain in the Thuringian Rh\u00f6n. In spite of that some maps give the height of the Ellenbogen as 816 metres as well.

Biography He was born on 1 July 1869 at Tanjung Brambang, Krian. He was the second son of Sultan Abdullah Muhammad Shah II and Raja Tipah Binti Almarhum Sultan Shahabuddin Ri'ayat Shah Saifullah. Raja Sir Chulan received his early education at the Raffles Institution in Singapore at the age of 7 in 1876. Just a year after, his father Sultan Abdullah Muhammad Shah II was exiled to the Seychelles Island for his involvement in the murder of the first British Resident of Perak, J.W.W. Birch . Raja Sir Chulan later continued his secondary education at the Malacca High School in 1882. At 17 years old, he joined the State Secretariat Kuala Kangsar and serve the office for 3 years. In 1889 after 13 years of separation, Raja Sir Chulan went to Seychelles Island to meet his family. Upon returning to Perak, Raja Sir Chulan was appointed as Settlement Officer Kurau, and later as Settlement Officer Parit Buntar cum Majistret. He joined with the British, as well as with the sultans of Perak , Selangor , Negeri Sembilan and Pahang to form a federation , dubbed the Federated Malay States , on 1 July 1896, the nucleus around which the present-day Malaysia was eventually created. Beginning in 1920, local rulers in British Malaya, led by Sultan Iskandar (Sultan of Perak), Tuanku Muhammad (Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan), Raja Chulan (Perak royalty) and Abdullah Dahan (Undang Luak of Rembau) urged Britain's Colonial Office to raise an infantry regiment for the malays from the colonial population. The infantry regiment set a foundation to the establishment of Royal Malay Regiment as a pioneer regiment in the Malaysian Armed Forces . He later became a member of the Federal Law Committee in 1924. Raja Chulan had also urged the British to improve the Malay people 's economic standing and their access to employment in the civil service. He was made an honorary CMG in 1925. Death and legacy He died on 10 April 1933 and was buried in the Al-Ghufran Royal Mausoleum , Kuala Kangsar , Perak . In Kuala Lumpur, there is a street named Jalan Raja Chulan (formerly Weld Road) which was renamed after him in 1982, as well as a monorail station along that street.

{"id": "doc_random_256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pittsburgh_Survey", "text": "The Pittsburgh Survey (1907\u20131908) was a pioneering sociological study of the city of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States funded by the Russell Sage Foundation of New York City . It is widely considered a landmark of the Progressive Era reform movement. The Survey is one of the earliest and most thorough descriptions of urban conditions in the United States. Some seventy investigators, including Elizabeth Beardsley Butler , Margaret Byington, John R. Commons , Edward T. Devine, Crystal Eastman , John A. Fitch , documentary photographer Lewis Hine , and artist Joseph Stella , began work in 1907. The research was first published in magazines, including Collier's , in 1908 & 1909, then was expanded into a series of six books (4 monographs and 2 collections of essays) published from 1909 to 1914. In the early twentieth century Pittsburgh was America's prototypical industrial city. Immigrants from Central, Eastern and Southern Europe poured in seeking jobs and escape from poverty. Large corporations such as U.S. Steel dominated local governments. Life for most Pittsburgh citizens was famously smokey and hardscrabble. Progressives and urban reformers viewed with alarm working-class and immigrant life, corporate industrialism, and the effects of industrialization on the urban environment. Survey director Paul Kellogg aimed to connect the reformist purpose with the latest methods of scientific inquiry. He hoped the results would alert the public about the social and environmental ills raging in industrial America and favorably influence policymaking, both corporate and government, in Pittsburgh and throughout the nation.

{"id": "doc_random_257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Motorways", "text": "Associated Motorways was a consortium of motor coach operators in the south and Midlands of England, which was active from 1934 to 1974. History An older logo dating from 1949 See also: Coach transport in the United Kingdom Associated Motorways was formed as a result of the Road Traffic Act 1930 , which encouraged competing coach operators to co-ordinate their services. In 1934, six coach operators came together to form Associated Motorways, to pool their services between the Midlands and the south and west of England and between London and South Wales . The founder members were: Black & White Motorways of Cheltenham , Red & White of Chepstow , Royal Blue , Greyhound (by then owned by Bristol Tramways ), Midland Red and United Counties of Northampton . Associated Motorways did not own or operate any coaches. Each member company committed itself to providing an agreed mileage of coach journeys for Associated Motorways and took an agreed share of the profits. The pool mainly operated the hub and spoke model , the hub being Cheltenham where Black & White had opened a new coach station in 1931. The consortium had to suspend operations during World War II from 1942 to 1946, but prospered after the war. New members joined: Lincolnshire Road Car and Eastern Counties in 1956, Crosville in 1965 and finally Southdown in 1972. All of the members except Black & White also operated their own coach services outside the consortium. At a peak summer weekend the consortium could have over 800 coaches on the road. Every day, coaches from all over England and Wales converged on Cheltenham, where most passengers changed coaches to continue their journey. At 14:00 sharp an inspector blew his whistle, and the coaches departed en masse. Two things killed Associated Motorways. One was the spread of the motorway network. Although motorways were good for coach services generally, they made Associated Motorways' hub and spoke model uncompetitive and obsolete. The other was the government's desire to rebrand and rationalise the coach services under its control. Although most of the consortium members had been state-owned since 1947, nationalisation did not greatly affect Associated Motorways until the government acquired the remaining members though its acquisition of British Electric Traction in 1968. All of the members became subsidiaries of the state-owned National Bus Company in 1969. In 1973 the National Bus Company formed National Travel (later National Express ) to run coach services, and all Associated Motorways' services were transferred to National Express in 1974. Like Associated Motorways before it, National Express was a marketing operation which relied mostly on coaches supplied by other companies. But unlike Associated Motorways, National Express imposed its own National brand on the operating companies' coaches. The Cheltenham coach station finally closed in 1984.

{"id": "doc_random_260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberfan", "text": "Aberfan ( Welsh pronunciation: [\u02ccab\u025br\u02c8van] ) is a former coal mining village in the Taff Valley 4\u00a0mi (6\u00a0km) south of the town of Merthyr Tydfil , Wales . On 21 October 1966, in the Aberfan disaster , a colliery spoil tip collapsed into homes and a school, killing 116 children and 28 adults. Geography Aberfan is situated toward the bottom of the western valley slope of the River Taff , on the eastern slope of Mynydd Merthyr hill, about four miles (6\u00a0km) south of the town Merthyr Tydfil . The Taff runs north-to-south through the village; at the upper side of the settlement, on the western outskirts, a disused Glamorganshire Canal bed and a railway embankment run parallel to the river. History Aberfan consisted of two cottages and an inn frequented by local farmers and bargemen until 23 August 1869, when John Nixon and his partners started the Merthyr Vale Colliery. Between 1952 and 1965, with mountains denuded there was severe flooding in the Pantglas area of Aberfan on at least 11 occasions. By 1966 the population had grown to approximately 5,000, most of whom were employed in the coal industry. Aberfan disaster, 1966 Main article: Aberfan disaster For many years, millions of cubic metres of excavated mining debris from the colliery were deposited on the side of Mynydd Merthyr , directly above the village of Aberfan on the opposite side of the valley. Huge piles, or \"tips\", of loose rock and mining spoil had been built up over a layer of highly porous sandstone that contained numerous underground springs , and several tips had been built up directly over these springs. Although local authorities had raised specific concerns in 1963 about spoil being tipped on the mountain above the village primary school, these were largely ignored by the National Coal Board 's area management. Early on the morning of Friday, 21 October 1966, after several days of heavy rain, a subsidence of about 3\u20136 metres occurred on the upper flank of colliery waste tip No. 7. At 9:15\u00a0a.m. more than 150,000 cubic metres of water-saturated debris broke away and flowed downhill at high speed. A mass of over 40,000 cubic metres of debris slid into the village in a slurry 12\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft) deep. The slide destroyed a farm and 20 terraced houses along Moy Road, and struck the northern side of the Pantglas Junior School and part of the separate senior school, demolishing most of the structures and filling the classrooms with thick mud and rubble up to 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) deep. Mud and water from the slide flooded many other houses in the vicinity, forcing many villagers to evacuate their homes. In total, 116 children and 28 adults were killed. Aberfan memorials White arches in Bryntaf Cemetery, Aberfan, mark the graves of the children killed in the disaster Aberfan Memorial Garden on the site of the children's school Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited Aberfan on 29 October 1966. After the disaster, the mayor of Merthyr immediately launched a disaster fund to aid the village and the bereaved. By the time the fund closed in January 1967, nearly 90,000 contributions had been received, totalling \u00a31,606,929. The fund's final sum was approximately \u00a31,750,000 (equivalent to \u00a340\u00a0million in 2023 ). The concerns of the village and donors grew about how the money in the fund would be used: some felt it should be used to compensate the bereaved, whilst others felt it should benefit the wider community. The funds paid for the memorial garden and cemetery along with other facilities to aid the regeneration of Aberfan both physically and emotionally. The Aberfan Cemetery is where many of the victims are buried. The original Portland and Aurisina limestone memorials erected shortly after the disaster began to deteriorate, and in 2007 the Aberfan Memorial Charity refurbished the garden area, including all of the archways and memorials. The weathered masonry was replaced with polished pearl white granite , all inscriptions were re-engraved and additional archways were erected. In 2022 the cemetery, together with the memorial garden and the area of the tip and its slide path, were listed on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales . The record of the Grade II* listed site describes it as being \"of great national importance and meaning.\" The Coventry Playground was built in 1972 on the site of the old Merthyr Vale School, with money collected by the people of Coventry . The playground was officially opened by the mayor of Coventry. A memorial garden was opened on the site of Pantglas Primary School, which was destroyed during the disaster. The park was partly opened by the Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, on her visit to Aberfan in 1974. The Aberfan Memorial Charity was founded in 1989 and is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the cemetery and memorial garden. Places of worship Bethania Welsh Independent Chapel was built in 1876 and rebuilt in 1885. At the time of the Aberfan disaster in 1966 the chapel was used as a temporary mortuary where victims were taken to be identified by relatives. The chapel was demolished in 1967 and a new chapel erected in 1970. By 2007 the chapel had fallen into disrepair and was closed; memorial items from the disaster were relocated to Cardiff Bay . Aberfan Calvinistic Methodist chapel was built 1876, in an Italianate style. The foundation stone was laid by Sarah Griffiths, wife of the owner of the Aberfan Estate. It became a Grade II listed building in August 1999. After the Aberfan disaster, the chapel was furnished with a memorial organ by the Queen. The chapel was restored in the early 21st century but an outbreak of dry rot saw a condemnation order by a buildings inspector and a refusal by the insurers to renew the building's insurance. In 2012, the building was offered for sale. A subsequent arson attack in 2015 caused yet further damage. Zion Methodist Church The village has two smaller chapels: the former Smyrna Baptist Chapel, built in 1877, which is now closed and is used as a community centre, and the Zion Methodist Chapel, originally English Primitive Methodist , located on Bridge Street and built in 1891. Transport Aberfan lies next to the main A470 road, but its nearest junction is 4\u00a0mi (6.4\u00a0km) north of the village. Aberfan is served by Merthyr Vale railway station , on the Merthyr line . The Taff Trail , a long-distance cycle route and footpath, passes through Aberfan, partly following the route of the filled-in Glamorganshire Canal . Education Aberfan has two primary schools: Ynysowen Primary School adjacent to the Grove Field; and Ysgol Gynradd Gymraeg Rhyd y Grug, which has moved to the previously occupied Ynysowen Primary School building. Facilities Aberfan & Merthyr Vale Community Centre: opened in 1973 with a swimming pool, fitness room, weights room, caf\u00e9 and a hall.

It stretches along some seven kilometers of unspoilt coastline of the Gulf of Castellammare and its mountain chain, the setting of steep cliffs and little bays. The Zingaro Reserve has a large variety and abundance of rare and endemic plants, as well as a rich fauna . The highly varied ecological niches give a great diversity which is not easily found in others parts of the island. In the Zingaro Reserve at least 39 species of birds nest and mate, mainly birds of prey, including the peregrine falcon , the common kestrel and the common buzzard . The area has also a rich archaeological past; for example the spectacular Grotta dell'Uzzo was one of the first prehistoric settlements in Sicily. The reserve has a complex network of paths, shelters, water taps, picnic areas, museums, carpark, and other amenities; there are no roads and it can only be visited on foot. The Zingaro Reserve incorporates not only the land and beaches, but also the adjacent sea. The beautiful beaches, pebbled and lapped by the clear blue sea, can be reached along various rather steep paths. Cala Tonnarella dell'Uzzo. References ^ \"San Vito Lo Capo\" .

{"id": "doc_random_262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Image_(song)", "text": "\" Public Image \" is the debut single by Public Image Ltd . It reached number nine on the UK Singles Chart . The lyrics were written when band co-founder John Lydon was a member of the Sex Pistols . The song addresses Lydon's feelings of being exploited in the Sex Pistols by Malcolm McLaren and the press. Along with being released as a single, it appeared on PiL's 1978 debut album Public Image: First Issue . On the song, PiL leader John Lydon has said: 'Public Image', despite what most of the press seemed to misinterpret it to be, is not about the fans at all, it's a slagging of the group I used to be in. It's what I went through from my own group. They never bothered to listen to what I was fucking singing, they don't even know the words to my songs. They never bothered to listen, it was like, 'Here's a tune, write some words to it.' So I did. They never questioned it. I found that offensive, it meant I was literally wasting my time, 'cause if you ain't working with people that are on the same level then you ain't doing anything. The rest of the band and Malcolm never bothered to find out if I could sing, they just took me as an image. It was as basic as that, they really were as dull as that. After a year of it they were going 'Why don't you have your hair this colour this year?' And I was going 'Oh God, a brick wall, I'm fighting a brick wall!' They don't understand even now. It entered the UK Singles chart on 21 October 1978 at number 21. The single then peaked at number 9 on 4 November 1978. Single The single was originally packaged in a fake newspaper that makes outrageous statements such as \"Refused To Play Russian Roulette\", \"No one's Innocent, Except Us\", \"Donut's Laugh saves life\" (Donut being a nickname for Jim Walker ) and \"The Girl Who Drove Me To Tea\" among others. The B-side , \"The Cowboy Song\", was designed to mock people buying the record (the track's only sensical rhythm is a bassline played over nonsensical yelling), much to the dismay of drummer Jim Walker . NME named it the 242nd greatest song of all time in 2014. The song's bass line was named as the 18th best bassline of all time by Stylus Magazine in 2005.

The 85th (Bucks Volunteers) Regiment of Foot was a British Army line infantry regiment , raised in 1793. Under the Childers Reforms it amalgamated with the 53rd (Shropshire) Regiment of Foot to form the King's Shropshire Light Infantry in 1881. History Formation Lieutenant-Colonel George Nugent , founder of the regiment The regiment was raised in Buckinghamshire by Lieutenant-Colonel George Nugent as the 85th Regiment of Foot , in response to the threat posed by the French Revolution , on 18 November 1793. The regiment was sent to join the Duke of York 's army in the Netherlands in 1794 as part of the unsuccessful defence of that country against the Republican French during the Flanders Campaign . It was posted to Gibraltar in 1795 and returned home in 1797. It embarked for the Netherlands again in August 1799 and saw action at the Battle of Alkmaar and the Battle of Castricum in October 1799 during the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland . Napoleonic Wars The Battle of New Orleans , at which the regiment carried out a successful attack, January 1815 A second battalion was raised in 1800. The 1st Battalion was deployed to Madeira in 1801 and both battalions went to Jamaica in 1802; the two battalions were amalgamated there later in the year. The regiment absorbed the Bucks volunteers in 1802 and became the 85th (Bucks Volunteers) Regiment of Foot in 1802. It returned to England in 1808 and converted to a Light Infantry role, becoming the 85th (Bucks Volunteers) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry) later in the year. The regiment next took part in the disastrous Walcheren Campaign in autumn 1809. The regiment embarked for Portugal in 1811 for service under Viscount Wellington in the Peninsular War .

The regiment was dispatched to North America in May 1814 and saw action in the last phase of the War of 1812 . It fought at the Battle of Bladensburg , capturing two American colours, in August 1814. Under the command of Colonel William Thornton , the regiment accompanied by detachments from the Royal Navy and Royal Marines , carried out a successful attack on the American positions on the west bank of the Mississippi River during the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815.

It embarked for India in 1868 and was deployed to Afghanistan for service in the Second Anglo-Afghan War in 1878. After returning to India, it took part in operations against the Zaimukhts and was involved in the destruction of their capital, Zawa, in 1879. As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 85th was linked with the 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot , and assigned to district no. 42 at Cowley Barracks in Oxford .

The Oregon Star Party takes place in the Ochoco National Forest , near the geographical center of the state of Oregon . It is far enough from population centers to provide some of the darkest skies in North America. The area's 5,000-foot (1,500\u00a0m) altitude contributes to steady seeing , which frequently provides near ideal observational conditions. The OSP site also has a treeless field of view providing an unobstructed 360 degree horizon. Usually held in August or September during a new moon, OSP attracts as many as 600-800 attendees. The highest attendance was in 2003, with 900 attendees. OSP features a wide range of amenities such as a latte stand, chuckwagon stand, and showers. Many vendors sell various astronomy-related goods, and there is a swap meet every day during the four-day event. Participation does not require a telescope, as most amateur astronomers let visitors look through their telescopes. Daytime events include guest speakers, such as telescope makers, NASA representatives, and optics manufacturers. Also, OSP has a guided tour through the \"telescope fields\" which discusses many of the different telescope designs and custom builds. OSP also offers activities for children and offers an observing challenge ranging in difficulty from beginner to advanced. Due to its unique location, OSP attracts casual observers, professional observers, astro-photographers, and beginners interested in astronomy. The Star Party was cancelled in 2020 on grounds of COVID-19 pandemic , and cancelled in 2021 due to fire risk.

{"id": "doc_random_271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_%26_Juliet:_Sealed_with_a_Kiss", "text": "Romeo & Juliet: Sealed with a Kiss is a 2006 American animated musical romantic fantasy comedy-drama film loosely following the play Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare . The film is about two star-crossed sea lions , Romeo and Juliet (voiced by Daniel and Patricia Trippet respectively), who fall in love against the wishes of their warring families. It was released in Spain in mid-2006 and on October 27 in the United States. The film was directed, written, and entirely animated by former Disney animator Phil Nibbelink . The film, created on an estimated budget of $2 million, took 4\u00bd years to complete and required 112,000 frames, all drawn by Nibbelink on a Wacom tablet directly into Flash 4 in combination with Moho software. While it received mixed-to-negative ratings, it won an award in Best in Show at the Southwest Film Festival. Plot Warring Capulet's herd and Montague's herd, portrayed as Steller sea lions and California sea lions respectively, have their feud watched in horror and astonishment by Capulet's only daughter, Juliet. A fight on the shore is ended when the Prince, an elephant seal , appears and warns the two groups that, if there is any more disturbance, the seal who caused it shall be exiled to Shark Island where his henchman Sharky lives. Romeo, Montague's only son, is depressed, wishing to fall in love with someone. His humorous and rebellious friend, Mercutio, urges him and another of his friends, Benvolio, to go to a Capulet party later that evening. They attend the party, covered in white sand to look like Capulets, and Romeo falls in love with Juliet at first sight. Juliet, however, was promised by her father to marry the Prince, who attends the party. Romeo and his friends manage to wreak havoc, and are revealed to be Montagues. Later that evening, the play's balcony scene is recreated on a cliff on the beach where a tree grows. Romeo promises Juliet that they shall marry the next morning, and she will not have to marry the Prince. Romeo begs Friar Lawrence the sea otter , to wed them. After some thought, the friar believes their marriage will end the feud between their families, and agrees. Romeo and Juliet are wed that morning and traverse the sea in their happiness. However, even the other sea and land animals strongly oppose their being together. A kissing goldfish named Kissy finds them a lovely couple, but warns them that they will be in big trouble if the Prince finds out. Back on the beach, Mercutio is telling many jokes, which leads to him making insulting jokes against the Capulets, and the Prince is headed in that direction. When he arrives, Mercutio mocks him as well. Romeo rushes to aid his friend, but after a struggle Mercutio falls off the cliff where Juliet met Romeo the previous evening, and everyone thinks that he is dead. The Prince, jealous of Juliet's affection for Romeo, exiles Romeo to Shark Island. In despair, Juliet seeks the Friar's help, and he gives her a potion to put her in a deathlike state. Mercutio is revealed to be alive and sees the whole thing, remarking, \"What a tangled web we weave\". Lawrence shows the Capulet seals that Juliet is \"dead\", right as they were celebrating the marriage. But Benvolio sees her as well, and swims to Shark Island to tell Romeo. The Friar chases him to stop him, but is attacked by Sharky. After receiving the terrible news from Benvolio, Romeo heads to the shore to see if Juliet is truly dead. Friar Lawrence arrives too late and tries to follow Romeo, only to have his tail maimed by Sharky. After an undersea chase and some help from Kissy, the fish Romeo and Juliet met earlier, Lawrence escapes and heads to the beach. A heartbroken Romeo walks past the mourning Capulets and tries to kiss Juliet, only to have some of the potion slip into his own mouth, putting him in a deathlike state as well. Two groups of seals begin to weep for their loss, and Lawrence, who has just arrived, teaches them a lesson about where hatred leads them to evil. Suddenly, Romeo and Juliet awaken, and all is well. Mercutio returns, and the prince finds a new mate, an elephant seal like himself. The movie ends with the two families at peace, and Romeo and Juliet remaining together.

Production Background Nibbelink, a former Disney animator, and his wife, Margit Friesacher, founded the independent company Phillip Nibbelink Productions in 1998. He said that he grew tired of the \"big industry merry-go-round\" and wanted to make films himself. He had independently created two feature-length animated films before Romeo & Juliet: Sealed with a Kiss , Puss in Boots and Leif Ericson: The Boy Who Discovered America . Nibbelink decided to make Romeo and Juliet in 2000, when he was finishing Leif Ericson , and began work on it in early 2003. Nibbelink wanted the film to be a family-friendly version of Shakespeare's original tale, because of the few appropriate family films available at the time. Animation Nibbelink in his studio working on the film. The film took 4\u00bd years of animating and required 112,000 frames, each of which were completed in under 2 minutes and drawn on a Wacom tablet directly into Flash 4 , in combination with Moho software. All the frames together were done in a month, by Nibbelink's estimation. The Moho software was used for the \"over-the-shoulder\" or the \"listening\" characters, or crowd scene characters. The film was a half-year in post-production . Nibbelink used Flash 4 because when he tried to migrate to Flash 5, it created forward-compatibility problems. Even cut-and-paste work using Flash 4 and Flash 5 launched at the same time created RAM issues and crashed. Audio Most actors of the film were Nibbelink's friends and children, whose voices he recorded in a studio in his basement. The film's Spanish dub was originally done in Madrid . Nibbelink said his daughter's voice-over was completely unscripted: \"I would take these silly improvs that my little daughter would do. I mean, lines like, she would say, 'Babies \u2013 p-ew! I hate stinky babies!' I said, 'That's hilarious!' So I would use it\". The film had no official composer. Nibbelink bought melodies from royalty-free music compositions, and wrote the lyrics for the music. These royalty free music companies were Intents Creative Music, British Audio Publishing, Crank City Music, Jack Waldenmaier Music Productions in association with The Music Bakery, River City Sound Productions, Bejoodle Music, Fresh Music, and Music 2 Hues. Three songs are included in the film: a version of \" Twinkle Twinkle Little Star \", performed by Chanelle Nibbelink and arranged by Elva Nibbelink, \"Bite My Tail\", performed by Michael Toland and arranged by Nibbelink, and \"Singing Starfish\", performed by Jennifer, Russell, and Gigi Nibbelink. Release Theatrical release Nibbelink standing in front of the poster for the film. Nibbelink tried to sell the film to 800 people, and was picked up by distributors MarVista Entertainment for release in foreign territories and Indican Pictures for a domestic release. A preview of the film was screened at Sony Pictures Entertainment in Los Angeles, California on November 17, 2004, and the film was later showcased at the 2005 Asia Television Forum in Singapore . It was released as Fofita, una foquita la mar de salada to 32 theaters in Madrid and Seville on June 23, 2006. The film had a domestic total of $463,002 in its 34-week (238-day) box office run. On opening weekend in 2006, the film, which debuted in Los Angeles, California , grossed $80,938, with an average of $4,220. That same week, it grossed a total $109,720. The film closed its box office run on July 19, 2007, having grossed just $895 that same week. Despite being a minor box office bomb , as of June 2013, the film is the third most profitable film released by Indican Pictures. Home media The film was released to DVD on June 12, 2007. Animatedviews.com's Ben Simon, in his review of the DVD, gave it an overall 7 out of 10, praising the large bonus content for a low-budget film, but criticizing the glitchy sound and audio of the feature. A giveaway was previously held in 2005 by Abbey Home Media and Courier Kids, and the prize was a DVD copy of the film and a toy seal. Ten copies were given. Reissuing this film on DVD and a Blu-ray release of it have yet to be scheduled. Online streaming The film was available to stream on Netflix , but is eventually taken down in 2016. It was also available to purchase on iTunes and Amazon Prime , but removed from the sites in 2018. As of today, Lionsgate holds the film's streaming rights via their purchase of Starz in 2016. Critical reception The film was negatively received by critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that only 20% of critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 3/10, based on 5 reviews. Movies.com 's Dave White compared what he considered the film's poor animation to the animation of The Wild , and criticized some dialogue of the film judged \"vaguely Shakespearean\", sarcastically writing that \"children love 16th-century English pronouns\". Sam Adams of the Los Angeles Times called the film a \"genuine tragedy, although not in the Shakespearean sense\" and wrote that a \"comprehensive list of what's wrong with Romeo & Juliet: Sealed With a Kiss would stretch farther than the unabridged works of William S.\" LA Weekly ' s Luke Y. Thompson said that the film \"should find its primary audience among college potheads who like to watch '70s Hanna-Barbera creations on the Cartoon Network late at night\". Common Sense Media writer Renee Schonfeld said in his 2012 review that it was \"an amateurish effort with a grating villain, tired jokes, and sub-par music\". He gave it 2 out of 5 stars. Despite the mostly negative reviews, most critics did commend Nibbelink for animating the entire film by himself. In contrast, Reel.com's Pam Grady gave the film a 2.5 out of 4, saying that, \"surprisingly, it's not terrible\". Animatedviews.com's Ben Simon defended the film, saying it was \"a charming little movie\" that remains faithful to Shakespeare's text. The film won two awards at the Southwest Film Festival, in the animation and Best in Show category. References ^ a b c Romeo And Juliet: Sealed With A Kiss Production Information .

A writer for Dopamine observed, \"they have built a reputation for their killer energetic live show.\" Save Tonight ' s reviewer caught their show, \"the night was filled with cold beers, loud music, sweat and messy hair. Each artist brought their own energy to the stage from which absorbed by the crowd. A highlight of the night was when Skegss invited all members of Totty and Crocodylus to perform 'New York California'. The record received a huge response from the crowd as fans were thrown over the barrier.\" Both EPs were also issued as a compilation album (double EP), Holiday Food/Everyone Is Good at Something on vinyl at that time.

Reception Everyone Is Good at Something EP was reviewed by James Tait of Howl and Echoes , \"they look to push their career to further heights with the release of their sophomore [ sic ] EP... [they] happen to be fantastically talented at making punk rock: three honest chords on sun-bleached guitars, chugging rhythms and lyrics reflecting both the debauchery and uncertainty of themselves and the young crowds they manage to wow over on an almost nightly basis.\" Kill Your Stereo ' s Peyton Bernhardt rated it at 75 out-of 100, \"[it] plays out as an existential crisis that an indie rock aficionado may have amid a quintessentially Australian social setting... [they] are the Pharrell Williams of Aussie beach-rock, spreading the happiness around like a contagious virus that you\u2019d be goddamn lucky to catch.\" Mick Radojkovic of Lunchbox rated Holiday Food EP at three-out-of-five stars, \"the quintessential (post)summer release\" with \"Frothing, frenetic guitars with belting, carefree vocals bring all the goods for your Sunday scatterbrained recovery sesh.\" Track listing All tracks are written by Ben Reed, unless otherwise noted All tracks are written by Ben Reed, unless otherwise noted All tracks are written by Ben Reed, unless otherwise noted Charts References ^ Fuamoli, Sosefina (26 October 2015). \"Exclusive: Skegss (Bryon Bay) serve up a perfect dinner party playlist!\" .

It was released in Japan on June 13, 1992. Plot Akiko Narushima has just begun a new job consulting on art purchases for a large corporation. Her first day coincides with the first day of a hulking new security guard named Fujimaru, who is secretly a disgraced former sumo wrestler currently being re-investigated for the murder of his cheating lover and friend (and having narrowly avoided jail with an insanity plea during his first trial). At first, Akiko's days are complicated only by her uncertainty about her new job and by her lecherous manager, Kurume. But when Fujimaru finds an earring lost by Akiko, he begins wearing the earring and becomes obsessed with her, eventually leading him to shut down the electricity and phones in the office and embark on a murderous rampage. Trapped in the building with a killer, Akiko and her co-workers try to stay alive and get help from the outside world. Eventually, Fujimaru traps Akiko in the office of the eccentric Mr. Hyodo. He incapacitates Hyodo and confronts Akiko, who asks him to explain his actions. He makes a series of cryptic statements, giving Hyodo time to revive and strike him in the neck with the broken blade of a paper cutter . Grievously injured, Fujimaru tears Akiko's earring from his own ear and asks that she remember him before stumbling off. After Akiko and Hyodo are safely out of the building, police discover that he has hanged himself in the building's basement, where Akiko had earlier found an improvised shrine with her face on it. Cast Makiko Kuno as Akiko Narushima Yutaka Matsushige as Fujimaru Hatsunori Hasegawa as Hyodo Ren Osugi as Kurume Tar\u00f4 Suwa as Yoshioka Reception The film has been described as an early example of director Kiyoshi Kurosawa's distinct directorial style. Writing for the Japanese-cinema website Midnight Eye , reviewer Nicholas Rucka commented that \"notwithstanding the low-budget nature of the film, it brims with atmosphere.\" Rouven Linnarz of the website Asian Movie Pulse , wrote \"Of course, in comparison to later works this film has many flaws, missed opportunities, especially since its last half is too much embedded within the conventions of slasher. However, the film holds more than just a promise, and within Kurosawa\u2019s body of work it is a small, but significant piece of work.\". J. Doyle Wallis of DVD Talk was less positive, calling the film \"a b-grade slasher picture that probably wouldn't have any attention whatsoever if it hand't been made by a filmmaker who went on to establish some cult success. ...a fair to sub-standard film made by a talented director in their emerging, less polished days.\" It was chosen as the 10th best film at the 2nd Japan Film Professional Awards in 1993.

The league was officially affiliated with the US Club Soccer (US Club Soccer). Competition format The National Adult Leagues was divided into conferences (Northeast, South, Midwest and West). Each Region contained between three or four conferences with varying number of teams per conference. The four regions generally corresponded with the four US Soccer association , Northeast (Region I), Midwest (Region II), South (Region III) and West (Region IV). The regular season ran from May through July. Most conferences played between ten and twelve games against teams within the conference. When possible, each conference followed a double round robin format allowing for a balanced schedule. However, larger conferences had unbalanced schedules, given the constraints around scheduling games within its short window. The schedule was designed to allow college students to compete during their summer break. For the playoffs, the formats varied by region and conference with the four region champions facing each other in the National Semifinals and Championship games. Organization The NAL was organized in a mostly decentralized structure and was managed as a team-run league. Each year, the member clubs helped elect a Commissioner, Treasurer and Secretary and a Board of Directors. Each team was individually owned and operated, and was responsible for maintaining league minimum standards. New teams seeking membership into the NAL were subject to approval from an executive committee of existing team owners. Member clubs had the right to make localized decisions for their respective markets, conferences and regions based on what they believed was best for their particular region. The final Commissioner was Mark Shearer. Each conference was managed by the individual member clubs and elected a conference commission each year.

{"id": "doc_random_278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingley", "text": "This article is about the town in England. For other uses, see Bingley (disambiguation) . Bingley is a market town and civil parish in the metropolitan borough of the City of Bradford , West Yorkshire , England. It is sited on the River Aire and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal . The town had a population of 18,040 at the 2021 Census . History In 1775, a farmer near Bingley discovered a chest of silver coins, of which some dated to the rule of Julius Caesar , on his land. Founding Bingley was likely founded by the Saxons , by a ford on the River Aire . This crossing gave access to Harden , Cullingworth and Wilsden on the southern side of the river. Bingley's entry in the Domesday Book, 1086AD The origins of the name are from the Old English personal name Bynna + ingas (\"descendants of\") + l\u0113ah (\"clearing in a forest\"). Altogether, this would mean the \"wood or clearing of the Bynningas, the people called after Bynna\". Normans In the Domesday Book of 1086, Bingley is listed as \"Bingheleia\": m In Bingheleia hb. Gospatric iiij car' tra e' ad gld. tra ad ii car' Ernegis de burun h't. & Wast' e'. T.R.E. val, iiij lib'. Silva past' ii leu' lg' & i lat'. Tot' m' e iiij leu' lg' & ii lat' which roughly translated reads: In Bingheleia, Gospatric has a manor of four carucate of land to be taxed, land for two ploughs. Ernegis de Burun has it and it is waste. In the time of King Edward the Confessor it was valued at four pounds. Woodland pasture two leagues long and one broad. All the manor is four long and two broad. Medieval The ford was superseded by Ireland Bridge . Bingley was a manor which extended several miles up and down the Aire valley, extending upstream to Marley on the outskirts of Keighley and downstream to Cottingley . Bingley became a market town with the grant of a Market Charter in 1212 by King John . According to the poll tax returns of 1379, Bingley had 130 households, and probably around 500 people. The nearby towns of Bradford, Leeds and Halifax had about half this population. Therefore, at this time Bingley was the largest town in the area. No records tell of how Bingley fared in the Black Death that swept Europe in the 14th century. Approximately one third of all the people in Europe died of this plague, sometimes wiping out whole towns and villages. According to the 1379 Poll tax records, the nearby town of Boulton had no survivors worth taxing. Tudors In 1592, Bingley was shown on a map by Yorkshire map-maker Christopher Saxton as a single street with about 20 houses on each side. The church sits at the west end of the street opposite a single large house, possibly a manor house . Since Bingley was a market town, the market stalls would have been set up on either side of the main street. One of the oldest buildings in Bingley is a coaching inn , the Old White Horse Inn , on the flatter north bank of the River Aire by Ireland Bridge. Industrial Revolution Bingley Five Rise Locks. Like many towns in the West Riding, Bingley prospered during the Industrial Revolution . The Bingley section of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal was completed in 1774, linking the town with Skipton , and Bradford via the Bradford Canal . The canal passes through the town centre and ascends the side of the valley via the Bingley Five Rise and Bingley Three Rise Locks . Several woollen and worsted mills were built and people migrated from the surrounding countryside to work in them. Many came from further afield such as Ireland in the wake of the Great Famine . A railway and line goods yard were constructed bringing further trade. The villages of Gilstead and Eldwick became conurbated with Bingley. The Bingley Building Society was also founded in this period. Damart buildings Crosley Wood high-rise flats; demolished in 2020 Post-industrial Bingley Teacher Training College opened in 1911 with Helen Wodehouse as principal. The first intake of students was 102 women from in and around the then West Riding of Yorkshire . Before its closure in 1979, the college produced approximately 16,000 teachers. The Beeching Axe demolished the goods yard, although the station still has trains to Leeds, Bradford, Skipton, Morecambe and Carlisle . The textile mills have largely been closed. The Damart mill still stands and trades in textiles. Since 1995 the tannery, Bingley Mill & Andertons, have been converted into flats. The most cramped and outdated terraced housing was partly replaced with council housing , Bingley Arts Centre and the headquarters of the Bradford & Bingley Building Society. Further council housing was built up the hill towards Gilstead including three tower blocks , which were later demolished in 2020. In the wake of Margaret Thatcher 's reforms of council housing much of the council estate was sold and a substantial portion has been knocked down and rebuilt as private housing. The Bingley Permanent Building Society merged with the Bradford Equitable Building Society to form the Bradford & Bingley Building Society in 1964. It was decided to site the corporate headquarters in Bingley. This brought several thousand jobs to the town, but the building itself did not meet with universal acclaim and was demolished in 2015. The Bradford and Bingley collapsed in the 2008 credit crunch. Criminal Bingley's most infamous son is Peter Sutcliffe , the Yorkshire Ripper, who was convicted of the murders of 13 women and the attempted murder of seven others. Mark Rowntree , a spree killer , started his murderous campaign in Bingley before moving on to Eastburn and Leeds . He was convicted in 1976 of four murders. In 1966, bookie Fred Craven was brutally murdered in his betting shop on Wellington Street, Bingley. Craven, who was well known in the area because of his short stature (he was 4\u00a0ft 7in tall), had gone into his shop to collect papers despite there being no racing that day. It is believed that he had \u00a3200 in his wallet (\u00a33,200.00 in 2015 prices) which went missing. Mr Craven suffered extensive injuries at the hands of the killer. Because the local constabulary had a very narrow time frame for the murder, and the fact the killer must have been covered in blood, they anticipated a quick arrest. The Craven murder remains unsolved, but rumours that Peter Sutcliffe , the Yorkshire Ripper , was responsible for his murder resurfaced in 2017. ITV Calendar News asked Sutcliffe about Craven's death and also that of a taxi driver on Bingley Moor. In what was described as a \"bizarre letter\", Sutcliffe responded that he was not responsible for either crime to presenter Christine Talbot . Road history The main road through Bingley has been re-sited twice in its history. In 1904, a new cut of the road heading north west out of the town created a mini-bypass between All Saints Parish Church and the Railway. The cobbled road around the front of the church became Old Main Street. A huge section of the graveyard was taken out to lay the new road and the gravestones were used as flags on the paths around the church. A small section of the graveyard still exists on the east side of the new road bounded by the old path to Treacle Cock Alley and the railway. Plans had been on the table for a trunk road through Bingley and the Aire valley since at least 1970. In 1992 preparatory work was undertaken to lengthen Park Road bridge so that the Leeds Liverpool Canal could be moved slightly to the east. This work would allow the formation of the new road to be sandwiched between the railway and the canal. In 1998, the Government, gave the go ahead for the trunk road to be constructed. Post-relief road Bingley Panoramic view over Bingley In 2004, the Bingley Relief Road opened. The \u00a347.9\u00a0million road stretches from Crossflatts to Cottingley , threading through Bingley between the railway and the canal. One of the most expensive parts of the construction was moving a 160-yard (150\u00a0m) stretch of the canal. The construction involved the removal of Treacle Cock Alley pedestrian tunnel and the Tin Bridge, which have been replaced by the Three Rise Bridge, and the Britannia Bridge In 2004, the average home price in Bingley rose 30% to \u00a3196,850 \u2013 the second fastest appreciating area in the UK (after the nearby Hebden Bridge ). The road was a target of road protest camp where protesters occupied tree houses for nearly two years. Governance Myrtle Grove , which became the council headquarters in 1926 Bingley was part of the Wapentake of Skyrack , which was in turn part of the West Riding of Yorkshire . The ancient parish of Bingley included the chapelry of Morton and several other hamlets, including Cullingworth . In 1866, the parish was divided into the new civil parishes of Bingley and Morton. In 1898, Bingley Urban District was formed; by 1926, all council administration had been transferred to Myrtle Grove which became the town hall. In 1974 the urban district and civil parish were abolished and absorbed into the City of Bradford Metropolitan District in the new county of West Yorkshire. Bingley became a ward in the Bradford metropolitan district . A civil parish called Bingley Town Council was established on 1 April 2016 following a petition to Bradford Council in October 2015. This followed a two-year campaign by the Bingley Community Council Group. Elections were held in May 2016 for the first councillors for the new Bingley Town Council. It has 16 councillors representing eight wards: Bingley Central, Crossflatts, Lady Lane and Oakwood, Eldwick, Gilstead, Priestthorpe, Crownest and Cottingley. Councillors Bingley ward is represented on Bradford Council by three Labour party councillors; Susan Fricker, Marcus Dearden, and Joe Wheatley. indicates seat up for re-election. indicates seat won in by-election. Transport Bingley's railway station entrance Bingley railway station is situated in the town centre. It is a stop on the Airedale Line , part of the West Yorkshire Metro railway network, with services to Leeds , Bradford Forster Square and Skipton . Services are operated by Northern Trains . The A650 connects Bingley to Keighley and Skipton to the north-west, and to Shipley and Bradford to the south-east. Through traffic has been diverted onto the new dual carriageway avoiding the town centre. Bingley is served by several bus routes, operated by two companies. First West Yorkshire : 680 between Bradford and Bingley 616 / 619 between Bradford and Eldwick 622 between Bingley and Bradford. Keighley Bus Company : 662 between Bradford and Keighley 60 between Leeds and Keighley K17 / K19 between Keighley and Cullingworth. Leeds Bradford Airport is located 10 miles (16\u00a0km) to the east. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal passes through the town. There are several flights of locks in the Bingley section, the famous Five Rise Locks , the smaller Three Rise and a further two lock flight at Dowley Gap. The canal climbs steeply up the side of the Aire Valley through this section. Climate As with all of the United Kingdom, Bingley experiences a maritime climate ( Cfb ), characterised by cool to mild weather, with often cloudy and damp conditions. This is amplified by Bingley's hilly northern situation. The nearest official met office weather station for which data is available is 'Bingley No. 2\", actually located a couple of miles south of the town centre and at a relatively high 262 metres above sea level \u2013 More elevated than all of the urbanised area of Bingley. It is therefore likely that temperatures in central Bingley, at as little as 80 metres above sea level, tend to be 1 to 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C milder year round \u2013 though on cold clear nights this may be reversed as a temperature inversion takes hold. The highest temperature recorded since 1980 at Bingley was 37.4\u00a0\u00b0C (99.3\u00a0\u00b0F) during July 2022. The lowest temperature to be recorded was \u221211.9\u00a0\u00b0C (10.6\u00a0\u00b0F) on 18 December 1981.

{"id": "doc_random_280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violet_Lake", "text": "Violet Lake ( Hawaiian : Ki\u02bbowaiokihawahine ), is a small high-elevation lake located at 5,020\u00a0ft (1,530\u00a0m) above sea level on Mauna Kahalawai (the West Maui Mountains ), situated in the western part of the island of Maui . It is located in the boggy slopes near the \u02bbEke Crater and Pu\u02bbu Kukui , the highest peak of the West Maui Mountains. It is approximately 10\u00a0ft \u00d7\u00a020\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a06.1\u00a0m) in size. The lake's English name derive from the reflected color of the lake's surface and also the Maui violet ( Viola mauiensis ) which grows on its banks. The Hawaiian language name Ki\u02bbowaiokihawahine means the \"pond of Kihawahine\". The lake was important to the traditional Hawaiian religion . During ancient times, the lake and surrounding summit area was protected by kapu and regarded as the meeting place of heaven and earth. The lake was believed to be the home of the Hawaiian mo\u02bbo (lizard) goddess Kihawahine , who was associated with the ali\u02bbi nui (high chiefs or kings) of Maui and an \u02bbaumakua (family deity) of Queen Ke\u014dp\u016bolani , a descendant of the Maui royal line and the highest-ranking wife of King Kamehameha I , who established the Kingdom of Hawaii , and their son Kamehameha III . Kihawahine was also associated with the wetland and former royal complex at Moku\u02bbula located in the watersheds below the lake in Lahaina . The surrounding montane rainforest ecosystem on the slopes of Pu\u02bbu Kukui Watershed Management Area (the second wettest spot in the Hawaiian Islands ) is extremely diverse and home to many endemic species. The lake's own unique ecosystem has not been well studied. Species include the dwarfed \u02bb\u014dhi\u02bba lehua tree ( Metrosideros polymorpha ), the Maui violet ( Viola mauiensis ), a variety of Hawaiian lobelioids ( Lobelia gloriamontis ), the Hawaiian damsel flies ( Megalagrion spp. ), and others. It has been described as an \"extremely rare gem\" which have \"residents and visiting scientists alike\".

{"id": "doc_random_282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_ter_Borch", "text": "Moses ter Borch or Mozes ter Borch (1645-1667) was a Dutch painter, draughtsman and enlisted sailor in the Dutch navy. His surviving work consists mostly of drawings. He died in battle during one of the Dutch fleet's engagements in England during the Second Anglo-Dutch War . Life Moses ter Borch was born in Zwolle as the youngest son of Gerard ter Borch the Elder (1583 \u2013 1662) and Wiesken Matthys. His father had initially been a painter but had by the time of Moses's birth changed careers to become a convoy and license master in Zwolle, a function he inherited from his own father. His elder siblings included his half-brother, the prominent genre painter Gerard ter Borch (1617 \u2013 1681), his half-sister amateur artist Anna ter Borch (1622 \u2013 1679), his sister, the artist and poet Gesina ter Borch (1631 \u2013 1690), and his brother, the artist Harmen ter Borch (1638 - 1677). His father taught him to draw and paint. These lessons contained many features of traditional art education, with pupils typically starting with copying details from prints or drawings of famous artists, and later making copies of entire compositions while following the original as closely as possible. Young Man Standing with his Hands in his Pockets Moses' sketchbook contain studies entitled 'How to build a rampart' and 'How to put together a battalion to defeat the cavalry' and a complete course in military strategy. This shows he had an increasing interest in military matters. He joined the Dutch fleet which during the Second Anglo-Dutch War sailed up the Thames to attack the English fleet. Moses was severely wounded on 2 July 1667 during the Battle of Landguard Fort . He received shots in the head and in the heart. He succumbed to his injuries 10 days later and was buried on a hill slope in Harwich . His death was a devastating blow to his close family members who kept his memory alive through their artworks and writings. His half-brother Gerard and sister Gesina collaborated on a memorial portrait of their youngest brother in which Gerard painted Moses' portrait and Gesina the background and the objects. These objects evoke Moses' heroic death and the transience of life, such as time (the watch), death (the skull), eternity (ivy on the rocks) and loyalty (the dogs). Work Moses left a limited oeuvre as he died at a very young ago. Only a few paintings by his hand - all portraits - are known. He showed a great talent in drawing. He drew a large number of self-portraits that bear a striking resemblance to Rembrandt's striking studies in physiognomy and human expression. Inspired by Rembrandt's self-portraits, he explored his own face in these studies by depicting himself with different expressions. In these portrait studies he was able to express various emotions and expressions ranging from cheerful, to surly and conceited to angry. He also portrayed his close family members in a tender manner. In the early 1660s he made a series of penetrating, individualised studies of boys and men in military dress. About 20 figure studies from this series are known today. These drawings are made in red or black chalk and depict single figures, who appear mostly to be young seamen who were likely his shipmates.

The Invasion of Umuahia occurred during the final stages of the Civil War and happened eight months prior to the Biafran surrender. Background Ever since the early stages of the Nigerian Civil War, both sides had been fighting for control of the Imo State . The Imo State was particularly important due to its capital, Owerri . Owerri was first invaded by the Nigerians on September 17, 1968, during Operation OAU and it was kept under Nigerian control until the Capture of Owerri in early 1969. Oguta had been attacked many times before and it became an important city during the war. It lay directly in the path of Owerri but it was heavily fortified by Biafran soldiers. Many roads connecting Oguta and Owerri to Nigerian-controlled cities were purposely destroyed by Biafran soldiers to delay attacks by the Nigerian army. After the large Nigerian loss at Owerri, Col. Benjamin Adekunle was replaced by Col. Olusegun Obasanjo . Since Oguta had been gained and lost two times in the last year, Nigerian Head of State Yakubu Gowon ordered a final attack on Oguta and Owerri. Battle In May 1969 Murtala Muhammad and Mohammed Shuwa made their ways towards Oguta. Biafran President Odumegwu Ojukwu ordered Col. Omorowa , Adgara Ike , and Joseph Achuzie to defend the city. Before the arrival of the Nigerians Joseph Hannibal was able to destroy the Port Harcourt \u2013 Owerri road and the Owerri \u2013 Onitsha road. In late May 1969 Mohammed Shuwa arrived with a large force of men in downtown Oguta. A large gun battle ensued and ended with the retreat of Shuwa's men and over 500 dead on both sides. Olusegun Obasanjo arrived with Murtala Muhammad in July 1969 with over 30 tanks and over 10,000 men. Obasanjo's men surrounded the city and began shelling the city. Over 30% of the city's population fled with over 2,200 civilians killed or wounded in the crossfire. The Biafrans managed to keep Oguta under their control for another 3 months but lost it when Olusegun Obasanjo invaded the city with full force on October 9, 1969. Even though Oguta was captured by the Nigerians they were unable to capture Owerri. Aftermath The war remained at a stalemate until the invasion of Umuahia on December 24, 1969. The Biafran capital was moved to Owerri and there it stayed until the surrender of the country to the Nigerians on January 15, 1970.

It starts from SR\u00a0705 near Yorkshire . The route moves north across several counties, then northeast against the side of the Grand Lake . SR 364 then travels west along a concurrency with SR 703 , and ends at SR\u00a029 near St. Marys . The route was designated in\u00a01934, from SR 219 to SR 29. It was extended southwards to SR 705 in 1936 and completely paved by 1940. SR 364 was also extended in 1973 to the new alignment of SR 29. Route description The route travels through portions of Darke , Mercer , and Auglaize Counties. SR\u00a0364 starts at SR\u00a0705 , on the Darke\u2013Shelby county line. The route goes north in a straight line, through 53 yards (0.030\u00a0mi)\u00a0of Mercer County, and continues onto the Auglaize\u2013Shelby county line. SR\u00a0364 continues into Auglaize County, where it passes by the St. Joseph Catholic Church , a historic site. The highway intersects SR\u00a0119 in Minister and SR\u00a0274 in New Bremen. Later, SR\u00a0364 intersects SR\u00a0219 , and travels northeast, adjacent to the eastern side of the Grand Lake . Here, the farmland transitions into forests. The route meets at a T-intersection with SR\u00a0703 . The SR\u00a0364 and SR\u00a0703 concurrency travels northwestward, and SR\u00a0364 splits and heads north, after slightly more than a mile. SR\u00a0364 crosses a railroad track, and ends at a diamond interchange at SR\u00a029 . The road continues as County Road\u00a015 after this point. History Around 1932, a gravel road from SR 219 to SR 32 was built in Auglaize County, and was designated as SR 364 two years later. In 1936, the designation was extended southward along a gravel road from its terminus at SR 219. This changed the southern terminus to SR 705 , east of Osgood in Darke County. SR 364's northern terminus, SR 32, was renumbered to SR 54 in 1938, and it was renumbered again to SR 29 one year later. The section of SR 364 from SR 219 to SR 29 was also paved at this time. All of the highway was paved by 1940. In 1973, SR 29 was realigned northward to a divided highway , and its old alignment became part of SR 703. SR 364 was also extended to SR 29 via a concurrency with SR 703.

United States , 569 U.S. 530 (2013), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court held that the Ex Post Facto Clause is violated when a defendant is sentenced under a version of the United States Federal Sentencing Guideliness promulgated after he committed his criminal acts and the new version provides a higher sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the offense. Background Marvin Peugh was convicted of five counts of bank fraud for conduct that occurred in 1999 and 2000. At sentencing , he argued that the Ex Post Facto Clause required that he be sentenced under the 1998 version of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of his offenses rather than under the 2009 version in effect at the time of sentencing. Under the 1998 Guidelines, Peugh's sentencing range was 30 to 37 months, but the 2009 Guidelines assigned more severe consequences to his acts, yielding a range of 70 to 87 months.

Laughlin was then approached by Petiot, a guitarist for a group called The Barefoot Boys, which he joined at the age of 23. However, in 1968, Laughlin left the group. Career Following his departure from the Barefoot Boys, Laughlin founded the Banjo Boys, a group formed with his friends Kitty Salmon , Jacky Bougues , Marius Charles and Michael Garcia. Their song \"Little Sacred Island\" was released in 1968 and sold 54,000 copies. In 1971, he sang at the hotel Tahara'a and was noticed by a lady named Paulette Vienot who, during that year, gets Laughlin signed for a contract in Paris with Eddie Barclay compiling the song \"Moi girls\". Which did not meet the expected success that was hoped. In 1979, he moved to the United States . Two years later, he was contacted to represent France in the 1981 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \" Humanahum \". He finished third with 125 points, seven points behind Germany 's Lena Valaitis and eleven points behind the United Kingdom 's Bucks Fizz , who won the contest. In 1983, he celebrated his twenty-year career in Papeete . In 1985, he married Moeata Sasson, an accomplished dancer for the Tahitian dance troupe \"Tamari'i Fautaua. A few years later, Moeata staged her own dance troupe \"Tamari'i Poerava\", whose dancers then began performing alongside Gabilou. In early 2018, he recorded the song \"Source de ma vie\" (\"Source of My Life\". ) in a duet with New Caledonian singer Claudia Haustien. Later life In 1993 he returned on stage with \"Hei No\". However, in 1995, feeling ill, Gabilou went to a medical clinic in Papeete where he was diagnosed with having paralyzed vocal cords. Despite the bad news, he fought to regain his voice and left for France where he met speech therapist Dr Veil. After attending numerous rehabilitation sessions he regained his voice and released the album \"Rohipehe\" In 2000 Gabilou decided to produce his own songs together with his friend and singer Andy Tupaia. Along with John Marote Mariassouce, the song \"Fakateretere\" featured on the album with the same name, was produced. It sold 20,000 copies and continues to be recognised throughout the Pacific as his signature song. Gabilou continues to perform on stage. In 2001 and 2002 he was invited to Rarotonga , Cook Islands where he had also lived previously, to sing in front of 3500 people. In 2003 he performed at the Oscars of Polynesian music. On 8 June 2013 he celebrated his 50th year in the industry with a concert in Pape'ete's House of Culture.

The Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association (M.I.A.A.) is a boys' sports conference for private high schools generally located in the Baltimore metropolitan area but extending to various other regions, including the state's mostly rural Eastern Shore. The M.I.A.A. has 27 member schools and offers competition in 17 sports. In most sports, it offers multiple levels of competition, including Varsity, Junior Varsity, and Freshmen-Sophomore teams, and the conference is broken down by separate leagues in each. In addition, members are sorted in accordance with continual performance; categories include 'A', 'B', or 'C' Conferences. Teams of the Association (League) may move up or down according to their performance spanning over the course of a year or so to maintain the competition at appropriate levels. Such levels vary for each sport; a school with a \"B-Conference\" lacrosse team can have an \"A-Conference\" soccer team: it all depends on the athletic performance of that particular sport. Seven members of the M.I.A.A. (along with non-MIAA member St. Maria Goretti) also form the Baltimore Catholic League in boys basketball. In addition, many of the same schools compete in the simultaneously organized, all-female \" Interscholastic Athletic Association of Maryland \" in various girls' sports, together with the all-female schools of the same region. Sports History Formed in 1994, the M.I.A.A., was the successor organization for boys to the former Maryland Scholastic Association , formed in 1919, through the leadership of Dr. Phillip H. Edwards .

Raphael 's c. \u20091518 painting of Prophet Ezekiel 's vision of God the Father in glory God the Father is a title given to God in Christianity . In mainstream trinitarian Christianity , God the Father is regarded as the First Person of the Trinity , followed by the Second Person, Jesus Christ the Son , and the Third Person, the Holy Spirit . Since the second century, Christian creeds included affirmation of belief in \"God the Father ( Almighty )\", primarily in his capacity as \"Father and creator of the universe\". Christians take the concept of God as the father of Jesus Christ metaphysically further than the concept of God as the creator and father of all people, as indicated in the Apostles' Creed where the expression of belief in the \"Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth\" is immediately, but separately, followed by \"and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord\", thus expressing both senses of fatherhood. Christianity God the Father depicted in The Creation of Adam by Michelangelo , 1510 Main article: God in Christianity See also: Patriology (Christianity) and Name of God in Christianity Overview In much of modern Christianity, God is addressed as the Father, in part because of his active interest in human affairs on the earth, in the way that a father would take an interest in his children who are dependent on him and as a father, he will respond to humanity, his children, acting in their best interests. Many believe they can communicate with God and come closer to him through prayer \u2013 a key element of achieving communion with God. In general, the title Father (capitalized) signifies God's role as the life-giver, the authority , and powerful protector, often viewed as immense, omnipotent , omniscient , omnipresent with infinite power and charity that goes beyond human understanding. For instance, after completing his monumental work Summa Theologica , Catholic St. Thomas Aquinas concluded that he had not yet begun to understand \"God the Father\". Although the term \"Father\" implies masculine characteristics , God is usually defined as having the form of a spirit without any human biological gender, e.g. the Catechism of the Catholic Church No. 239 specifically states that \" God is neither man nor woman: he is God \". Although God is never directly addressed as \"Mother\", at times motherly attributes may be interpreted in Old Testament references such as a hymn of praise Isa 42:14 , Isa 49:14\u201315 or Isa 66:12\u201313 . In the New Testament , the Christian concept of God the Father may be seen as a continuation of the Jewish concept, but with specific additions and changes, which over time made the Christian concept become even more distinct by the start of the Middle Ages . The conformity to the Old Testament concepts is shown in Matthew 4:10 and Luke 4:8 where in response to temptation Jesus quotes Deuteronomy 6:13 and states: \"It is written, you shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.\" 1 Corinthians 8:6 shows the distinct Christian teaching about the agency of Christ by first stating: \"there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him\" and immediately continuing with \"and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.\" This passage clearly acknowledges the Jewish teachings on the uniqueness of God, yet also states the role of Jesus as an agent in creation. Over time, the Christian doctrine began to fully diverge from Judaism through the teachings of the Church Fathers in the second century and by the fourth century belief in the Trinity was formalized. According to Mary Rose D'Angelo and James Barr, the Aramaic term Abba was in the early times of the New Testament neither markedly a term of endearment , nor a formal word; but the word normally used by sons and daughters, throughout their lives, in the family context. Old Testament An image of God the Father by Julius Schnorr , 1860 According to Marianne Thompson , in the Old Testament , God is called \"Father\" with a unique sense of familiarity. In addition to the sense in which God is \"Father\" to all men because he created the world (and in that sense \"fathered\" the world), the same God is also uniquely the law-giver to his chosen people . He maintains a special, covenantal father\u2013child relationship with the people, giving them the Shabbat , stewardship of his prophecies , and a unique heritage in the things of God, calling Israel 'my son' because he delivered the descendants of Jacob out of slavery in Egypt according to his covenants and oaths to their fathers, Abraham , Isaac and Jacob . In the Hebrew Bible , Isaiah 63:16 (JP) reads: \"For You are our father, for Abraham did not know us, neither did Israel recognize us; You, O [YHWH], are our father; our redeemer of old is your name.\" To God, according to Judaism, is attributed the fatherly role of protector. He is titled the Father of the poor, of the orphan and the widow, their guarantor of justice. He is also titled the Father of the king, as the teacher and helper over the judge of Israel. According to Alon Goshen-Gottstein, in the Old Testament \"Father\" is generally a metaphor ; it is not a proper name for God but rather one of many titles by which Jews speak of and to God. According to Mark Sameth, references to God the Father convulsing in labor, giving birth, and suckling (Deuteronomy 32:13, 18) hint to a priestly belief, noted in the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries by Guillaume Postel and Michelangelo Lanci respectively, that \u201cGod the Father\u201d is a dual-gendered deity. In Christianity fatherhood is taken in a more literal and substantive sense, and is explicit about the need for the Son as a means of accessing the Father, making for a more metaphysical rather than metaphorical interpretation. New Testament God the Father , Cima da Conegliano , c. \u20091510\u20131517 There is a deep sense in which Christians believe that they are made participants in the eternal relationship of Father and Son, through Jesus Christ. Christians call themselves adopted children of God: But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, \"Abba! Father!\u201d So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God. \u2014\u200a Galatians 4:4\u20137 In Christianity the concept of God as the Father of Jesus is distinct from the concept of God as the creator and Father of all people, as indicated in the Apostles' Creed . The profession in the creed begins with expressing belief in the \"Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth\" and then immediately, but separately, in \"Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord\", thus expressing both senses of fatherhood within the creed. History Since the second century, creeds in the Western Church have included affirmation of belief in \"God the Father (Almighty)\", the primary reference being to \"God in his capacity as Father and creator of the universe\". This did not exclude either the fact the \"eternal father of the universe was also the Father of Jesus the Christ\" or that he had even \"vouchsafed to adopt [the believer] as his son by grace\". Creeds in the Eastern Church (known to have come from a later date) began with an affirmation of faith in \"one God\" and almost always expanded this by adding \"the Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible and invisible\" or words to that effect. By the end of the first century, Clement of Rome had repeatedly referred to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and linked the Father to creation, 1 Clement 19.2 stating: \"let us look steadfastly to the Father and Creator of the universe\". Around AD 213 in Adversus Praxeas ( chapter 3 ) Tertullian is believed to have provided a formal representation of the concept of the Trinity , i.e. that God exists as one \"substance\" but three 'Persons': The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, and with God the Father being the Head. Tertullian also discussed how the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. While the expression \"from the Father through the Son\" is also found among them. The Nicene Creed , which dates to 325, states that the Son (Jesus Christ) is \"born of the Father before all ages\", indicating that their divine Father-Son relationship is seen as not tied to an event within time or human history. Trinitarian A depiction of the Trinity consisting of God the Father along with God the Son ( Jesus ) and God the Holy Spirit To Trinitarian Christians (which include Roman Catholics , Eastern Orthodox , Oriental Orthodox , Anglicans , and most but not all Protestant denominations ), God the Father is not a separate God from God the Son (of whom Jesus is the incarnation ) and the Holy Spirit , the other hypostases of the Christian Godhead . In Eastern Orthodox theology , God the Father is the arche or principium (\"beginning\"), the \"source\" or \"origin\" of both the Son and the Holy Spirit, and is considered the eternal source of the Godhead. The Father is the one who eternally begets the Son, and the Father through the Son eternally breathes the Holy Spirit. As a member of the Trinity, God the Father is one with, co-equal to, co-eternal, and consubstantial with the Son and the Holy Spirit, each Person being the one eternal God and in no way separated: all alike are uncreated and omnipotent. Because of this, the Trinity is beyond reason and can only be known by revelation. The Trinitarian concept of God the Father is not pantheistic in that he is not viewed as identical to the universe or a vague notion that persists in it, but exists fully outside of creation, as its creator. He is viewed as a loving and caring God, a Heavenly Father who is active both in the world and in people's lives. He created all things visible and invisible in love and wisdom, and created man for his own sake. The emergence of Trinitarian theology of God the Father in early Christianity was based on two key ideas: first the shared identity of the Yahweh of the Old Testament and the God of Jesus in the New Testament , and then the self-distinction and yet the unity between Jesus and his Father. An example of the unity of Son and Father is Matthew 11:27 : \"No one knows the Son except the Father and no one knows the Father except the Son\", asserting the mutual knowledge of Father and Son. The concept of fatherhood of God does appear in the Old Testament, but is not a major theme. While the view of God as the Father is used in the Old Testament, it only became a focus in the New Testament, as Jesus frequently referred to it. This is manifested in the Lord's Prayer which combines the earthly needs of daily bread with the reciprocal concept of forgiveness. And Jesus' emphasis on his special relationship with the Father highlights the importance of the distinct yet unified natures of Jesus and the Father, building to the unity of Father and Son in the Trinity. The paternal view of God as the Father extends beyond Jesus to his disciples, and the entire Church, as reflected in the petitions Jesus submitted to the Father for his followers at the end of the Farewell Discourse , the night before his crucifixion . Instances of this in the Farewell Discourse are John 14:20 as Jesus addresses the disciples: \"I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you\" and in John 17:22 as he prays to the Father: \"I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one.\" Nontrinitarian Main article: Nontrinitarianism The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ' depiction of God the Father and the Son Jesus A number of Christian groups and communities reject the doctrine of a co-equal Trinity, and generally teach that God the Father is supreme, but nontrinitarian Christian groups differ somewhat from one another in their views regarding God the Father and Christ the Son. In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Commonly known as Mormons or the LDS Church), the most prominent conception of \"the Godhead\" is as a divine council of three distinct beings: the Father (who is also referred to as Elohim ), the Son Jesus (who is identified with Jehovah of the Old Testament), and the Holy Spirit . The Father and Son are considered to have perfected, physical bodies, while the Holy Spirit has a body of spirit. LDS Church members believe God the Father presides over both the Son and Holy Spirit, where God the Father is greater than both, but they are one in the sense that they have a unity of purpose. Most denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement also believe God (often referred to as Heavenly Father) has at least one spouse referred to as Heavenly Mother , and together they are called Heavenly Parents . The Assemblies of Yahweh are nontrinitarian , believing that the Father is greater than the Son in all things , and that the Holy Spirit is not equal to the Father, and is not an actual person, but is God's \"power\" or \"character\" in action. They refer to God the Father as \" Yahweh \". The Yahweh Assemblies and other Sacred Name groups generally teach that Christ the Son was God's first and prime creation, and was used to create everything else. They believe that the Messiah, whom they call \" Yahshua \" or \" Yeshua \" or \" Yehoshua \", died for man's sins, and is to be honored as the Anointed Lord, but that God the Father (Yahweh) is the True God that all \"true worshippers\" ultimately serve and worship. They teach that the Father is the only eternal one. In Jehovah's Witness theology, only God the Father ( Jehovah ) is the one true almighty God, even over his Son Jesus Christ. They teach that the Logos is God's Only-begotten Son, and that the Holy Spirit is God's active force (projected energy). They believe that the Father and the Son are united in divine purpose, administration, legislation , and man's salvation , but are not one being and are not equal in power. While the Witnesses acknowledge Jesus\u2019 pre-existence, perfection, and unique \"Sonship\" from God the Father, and believe that the Logos had an essential role in creation and redemption, and is the Messiah, they believe that only the Father is without beginning. They say that the Son was the Father's only direct creation, before all ages. While both Persons are highly honored, taught, and preached, in their interpretations of John 17:3 and John 14:28 , God the Father is emphasized in Jehovah's Witness meetings and services more than Christ the Son, as they teach that the Father is greater than the Son. Oneness Pentecostalism teaches that God is a singular spirit who is one person, not three divine persons, individuals or minds. God the Father is the title of the supreme creator. The titles of the Son and Holy Spirit are merely titles reflecting the different personal manifestations of the One True God the Father in the universe. Other religions Although similarities exist among religions, the common language and the shared concepts about God and his title Father among the Abrahamic religions is quite limited, and each religion has very specific belief structures and religious nomenclature with respect to the subject. While a religious teacher in one faith may be able to explain the concepts to his own audience with ease, significant barriers remain in communicating those concepts across religious boundaries. Greco-Romanism Greco-Roman pagans believed in an original triad . Over time, the names and gods of the triad were changed\u2014except for Jupiter , which means \"Father Jove\" and comes from Proto-Italic Djous Pat\u0113r , from Djous (\u201cday, sky\u201d) + Pat\u0113r (\u201cfather\u201d), from Proto-Indo-European Dy\u1e17ws (literally \u201cthe bright one\u201d), root nomen agentis from Dyew - (\u201cto be bright, day sky\u201d), and Ph\u2082t\u1e17r (\u201cfather\u201d). God Worshipping Society Main article: God Worshipping Society A syncretic sect created by Hong Xiuquan , founder of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom , that mixed Protestantism and Chinese folk religion , the objective of this sect was to overthrow the Manchus and restore power to the Han . God consisted of a triad made up of Shangdi (the Supreme Emperor in ancient Chinese worship), Christ as the eldest son and Hong as the youngest son. Hinduism Main article: God in Hinduism In Hinduism , Bhagavan Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita , chapter 9, verse 17, stated: \"I am the Father of this world, the Mother, the Dispenser and the Grandfather\", one commentator adding: \"God being the source of the universe and the beings in it, He is held as the Father, the Mother and the Grandfather\". A genderless Brahman is also considered the creator and Life-giver, and the Shakta goddess is viewed as the divine mother and life-bearer. Islam Main article: God in Islam Unlike in Judaism, the term \"father\" is not formally applied to God by Muslims, and the Christian notion of the Trinity is rejected in Islam. Even though traditional Islamic teaching does not formally prohibit using the term \"Father\" in reference to God, it does not propagate or encourage it. There are some narratives of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in which he compares the mercy of God toward his worshipers to that of a mother to her infant child. Islamic teaching rejects the Christian father-son relationship of God and Jesus , and states that Jesus is a prophet of God, not the Son of God. Islamic theology strictly reiterates the Absolute Oneness of God, and totally separates him from other beings (whether humans, angel or any other holy figure), and rejects any form of dualism or Trinitarianism. Chapter 112 of the Quran states: Say, \u02f9O Prophet,\u02fa \u201cHe is God\u2014One \u02f9and Indivisible\u02fa; God\u2014the Sustainer \u02f9needed by all\u02fa. He has never had offspring, nor was He born. And there is none comparable to Him.\u201d \u2014\u200a Surah Al-Ikhlas 112:1\u20134 Judaism Main articles: God in Judaism and Names of God in Judaism See also: Av In Judaism, the use of the \"Father\" title is generally a metaphor , referring to the role as Life-giver and Law-giver, and is one of many titles by which Jews speak of and to God. The Jewish concept of God is that God is non-corporeal, transcendent and immanent, the ultimate source of love, and a metaphorical \"Father\". The Aramaic term for father ( Hebrew : \u05d0\u05d1\u05d0 , abba ) appears in traditional Jewish liturgy and Jewish prayers to God (e.g. in the Kaddish ). According to Ariela Pelaia, in a prayer of Rosh Hashanah , Areshet Sfateinu, an ambivalent attitude toward God is demonstrated, due to his role as a father and as a king. Free translation of the relevant sentence may be: \"today every creature is judged, either as sons or as slaves. If as sons, forgive us like a father forgives his son. If as slaves, we wait, hoping for good, until the verdict, your holy majesty.\" Another famous prayer emphasizing this dichotomy is called Avinu Malkeinu , which means \"Our Father Our King\" in Hebrew. Usually the entire congregation will sing the last verse of this prayer in unison, which says: \"Our Father, our King, answer us as though we have no deed to plead our cause, save us with mercy and loving-kindness.\" Sikhism Main article: God in Sikhism The Guru Granth consistently refers to the creator as \"He\" and \"Father\". This is because the Granth is written in north Indian Indo-Aryan languages (mixture of Punjabi and dialects of Hindi) which have no neutral gender. Since the Granth says that the God is indescribable, God has no gender according to Sikhism. God in the Sikh scriptures has been referred to by several names, picked from Indian and Semitic traditions. He is called in terms of human relations as father, mother, brother, relation, friend, lover, beloved, husband. Other names, expressive of his supremacy, are thakur , prabhu , svami , sah , patsah , sahib , sain (Lord, Master). In Western art Main article: God the Father in Western art Depiction of God the Father (detail), Pieter de Grebber , 1654 For about a thousand years, no attempt was made to portray God the Father in human form, because early Christians believed that the words of Exodus 33:20 \"Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see Me and live\" and of the Gospel of John 1:18: \"No man hath seen God at any time\" were meant to apply not only to the Father, but to all attempts at the depiction of the Father. Typically only a small part of the body of Father would be represented, usually the hand, or sometimes the face, but rarely the whole person, and in many images, the figure of the Son supplants the Father, so a smaller portion of the person of the Father is depicted. In the early medieval period God was often represented by Christ as the Logos , which continued to be very common even after the separate figure of God the Father appeared. Western art eventually required some way to illustrate the presence of the Father, so through successive representations a set of artistic styles for the depiction of the Father in human form gradually emerged around the tenth century AD. God the Father , Jacob Herreyns the Elder , 18th century By the twelfth century depictions of a figure of God the Father, essentially based on the Ancient of Days in the Book of Daniel had started to appear in French manuscripts and in stained glass church windows in England. In the 14th century the illustrated Naples Bible had a depiction of God the Father in the Burning bush . By the 15th century, the Rohan Book of Hours included depictions of God the Father in human form or anthropomorphic imagery. Though the depiction remains rare and often controversial in Eastern Orthodox art, by the time of the Renaissance artistic representations of God the Father were freely used in the Western Church.

The west summit is unofficially known as \"Point John.\" Two other peaks on the mountain are informally called \"Point Wesley\" (13,356\u00a0ft) in the middle, and \"Point Powell\" (13,360+\u00a0ft) one-half mile to the east. History This mountain was named in 1911 by Robert B. Marshall, chief USGS geographer, to commemorate John Wesley Powell (1834\u20131902), geologist, surveyor, map maker, explorer, and director of the United States Geological Survey from 1881 through 1894. The first ascent of the peak was made August 1, 1925, by Walter L. Huber and James Rennie, two of the foremost mountaineers of the Sierra Club , with Huber serving as club president from 1925 to 1927. In 1983 the U.S. Board on Geographic Names revised the location of the summit from Point Wesley to Point John.

Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean , and travel east toward the Sierra Nevada mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the range ( orographic lift ). Precipitation runoff from this mountain drains south into the Middle Fork Kings River , and north into Bishop Creek . Maps from the 1980s show Powell Glacier drawn on the north aspect of the mountain, however satellite images show that the glacier has since disappeared, a result of climate change .

{"id": "doc_random_294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Peterson_(serial_killer)", "text": "Obadyah Ben-Yisrayl (born Christopher Dwayne Peterson January 20, 1969) is an American serial killer found guilty of committing four murders and acquitted on three other murder charges related to the \"Shotgun Killer\" spree in Indiana from October 30, 1990, to December 18, 1990. The murders took place in a number of jurisdictions, and Peterson faced a number of trials in different venues. Peterson had initially confessed and then recanted. He was acquitted in two trials for three of the murders and found guilty of four murders in two subsequent trials. Initially sentenced to death for those murders, his death sentence was commuted in 2004. Ronald J. Harris was also charged and found guilty in two of the murders. He was sentenced to 90 years in prison. The incident is controversial for a number of reasons such as Peterson is African American , while the initial descriptions of the suspect of the murders was described as white; Peterson had been illegally arrested for committing another crime which impacted the use of evidence in the \"Shotgun Killer\" spree trials because it was deemed improperly collected; Peterson's initial confession was recanted under claims of duress; the trials with all-white juries came to different conclusions than juries which included people of other races; and in the final case to go to trial, the judge over-ruled the jury's decision not to impose the death penalty. Crime and investigation Between October 30, 1990, and December 18, 1990, there were a series of murders in northern Indiana in which seven people were killed by assault with a shotgun . A witness at one of the murders provided a description of the killer to police, who made up a drawing of the suspect and distributed it on flyers. The witness's description was of a \"clean-shaven, slender, white man with long stringy brown hair.\" Peterson, from Gary, and at the time was on an unauthorized absence from the Marines, and Antwion McGee, 21, were arrested January 29, 1991, after a robbery and an attempted murder of a restaurant manager at the Southlake Mall near Merrillville. McGee led police to Ronald J. Harris, 21. Harris told police he was with Peterson during two incidents where he alleged Peterson killed two of the victims. McGee also told police that Peterson admitted the killings. Trials The prosecution involved three defendants, seven murders, several attempted murders, with multiple locations which resulted in multiple trials in multiple venues. Trial of Harris for murder of Dhaliwal Harris was tried in June 1991 for the 13 December 1990 murder of Harchand Dhaliwal. Harris denied he killed Dhaliwal and said Peterson did it. Harris maintained he was merely an innocent bystander. The prosecution stated that Harris had accompanied Peterson during another murder, that of Hammersley. Harris had given a statement to the FBI in which he said he was with Peterson when Hammersley was murdered. But at his trial he denied this was the case. He said he signed the statement because the FBI said he could go home if he signed it. The witness to the Hammersley murder had also identified Harris as the shooter in the Hammersley murder. Harris was convicted. Harris was later convicted of Dhaliwal's murder as well. Harris was sentenced to a total of 90 years in prison. He is scheduled for release in 2035. Trial of Peterson for Mills and Hammersley murders Peterson's first trial in September and October 1991 was for the murders of Lawrence Mills and Rhonda Hammersley. In preparation for Peterson's first trial, several evidentiary hearings were held. In one, it was determined to allow the shotgun recovered from Peterson's apartment to be used as evidence because Peterson's mother had allowed police entry. The defense also objected to the confessions obtained by police. In examining the issue, it was held that Peterson's arrest for the mall restaurant incident was illegal, but that the confessions obtained some 30 hours after taking him into custody would be admissible, because the delay \"tend[ed] to dissipate any taint of illegality.\" Peterson had been identified by a witness in a photo-lineup as the man who shot at her while she was standing in her garage. This shooting took place between the time Mills was killed and the time Hammersley was killed. Because this photo lineup was performed after Peterson's illegal arrest for the unrelated robbery and shooting at the mall, it was determined it was \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d and could not be admitted; however, it was determined that the witness could identify him in open court. The second witness who saw Hammersley's murder testified that a shooter fired through an open window of her car at her. She ducked. She felt the weapon's muzzle on her neck, and then a voice said, \"All right, that's enough, let's go.\" The witness had originally identified the shooter as white, and had identified Harris as the shooter. She said that she recalled in January 1991 that the shooter had an accomplice. The prosecution's position was that Peterson was the shooter and Harris was the accomplice. The shotgun recovered from Peterson's apartment and the cartridge casings recovered from the crime scene were shown to be linked by examination of the marks made by the firing pin. Police testified that during the course of the interrogation, before he finally confessed, Peterson said, \"There is no white guy. I shot them all.\" The confession was introduced to prove the facts of the shootings. In addition, drug use and racial hatred became themes from Peterson's confession that the prosecution highlighted during all of Peterson's trials. The jury consisted of 6 whites, 4 blacks and 2 Hispanics; it included 8 women and 4 men. They acquitted Peterson. Jurors later stated that they believed the shells came from Peterson's gun, but had no evidence Peterson was ever at the crime scene. However, jurors did not know that Peterson's palm print had been taken from the surface of Mills\u2019 car. This would have established his presence at the crime scene, but it was not allowed as evidence because it was regarded as \"poisonous fruit\" of Peterson's illegal arrest. Jurors in this case and in succeeding cases were also suspicious of the confessions. The sketch circulated by police didn't look at all like Peterson. And the first witness's identification of Peterson as the shooter had wavered. Trial of McGee and plea bargain At the end of 1991 McGee was tried for the January 1991 robbery and shooting of the assistant manager of a restaurant at a mall. Peterson participated in this crime. McGee was arrested and led police to Harris and Peterson. According to McGee, Peterson admitted to him shooting at a man in the mall incident, and admitted to the other crimes as well. McGee faced a 50-year sentence, but as part of a deal requiring him to testify against Peterson in forthcoming trials, prosecutors agreed to charge him with a lesser offense carrying an 8-year term. Trial of Peterson for Wildermuth and Kotso shootings Peterson was tried in January for the murder of Wildermuth and the attempted murder of Kotso. The prosecution's evidence included Peterson's confessions, the shotgun and shell identification, McGee's testimony, and Kotso's eyewitness account. Against this, the defense presented an alibi that Peterson had been seen at a party. Kotso had originally repeatedly identified his attacker as a black man, but he had been badgered by highly aggressive questioning by an officer of the Indiana State Police to the point that he backed off the racial identification to avoid being seen as a racist. It turned out that the motive for the Kotso shooting was to confuse police with the second shooting of the night. Wildermuth had been killed in a rage fueled by drugs and racial antipathy; Kotso would not have been shot if he had been black. Again, Peterson was acquitted. Jurors stated they had come to their decision because (1) Police had not taken fingerprints from the shotgun itself; (2) they didn't seal off the crime scene and the shotgun shells used as evidence were found the next day; (3) only Peterson's confession, about which they had doubts, put him at the scene of the crimes, and (4) the police had conducted a 25-minute interrogation the day before the confession, but hadn't recorded it. Trial of Peterson for Dhaliwal and Meitzler murders Statements by the prosecution led to a mistrial at the jury selection stage. However, the process was restarted and evidence presented. The jury heard Peterson's confession in which he said he killed Dhaliwal in a \"rage to hurt,\" and \"just snapped\" when he killed Meitzler. The defense called Peterson's girlfriend to establish an alibi that he was at a party. Peterson was convicted. Prosecutors said it made no difference that the jury was all white. Trial of Peterson for the Balovsky murders This trial was held in April 1992. Prosecution evidence included Peterson's confession, McGee's testimony, and identification of shotgun shells found at the scene. The defense advanced an alibi defense, and stated that McGee had a key to Peterson's apartment and had access to the shotgun. Again highlighted were racial elements of the confession in which Peterson said, \"(They) were white people and at the time I had this vengeance. It just snapped.\" Again Peterson was convicted. The jury recommended against the death penalty, but Judge James Clement overrode the jury and sentenced Peterson to death. Reversal of death sentence and resentencing Peterson maintains his innocence. Peterson was granted post-conviction relief and re-sentenced to a total of 120 \u00a0 years in prison December \u00a0 12, 2004. According to the Indiana Department of Correction, Peterson is scheduled for release on December \u00a0 25, 2050 \u2009 \u2014 \u2009 one month shy of his eighty-second birthday.

{"id": "doc_random_295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_the_Swedes", "text": "Party of the Swedes ( Swedish : Svenskarnas parti, SvP ) was a neo-Nazi political party in Sweden . The party described itself as nationalist and sought to limit Swedish citizenship only to individuals who belong to the \"Western genetic and cultural legacy\". From 2013 to 2015, the party leader was Stefan Jacobsson. The party dissolved on 10 May 2015 due to lack of members. The \u00c6gishj\u00e1lmur rune was the official SVP symbol since it originated as Folkfronten (\"the people's front\"), a neo-Nazi party founded in 2008 by members of the National Socialist Front (NSF), the largest Swedish neo-Nazi party at the time. The current name was introduced in 2009 after socialist activists registered NSF's name with the Election Authority of Sweden , blocking its use. The party's only electoral success was one municipal mandate in 2010 in the small community of Gr\u00e4storp in V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland in western Sweden. The mandate was lost after it was revealed that their representative, Daniel H\u00f6glund, was not registered as a resident , which is a requirement for members of municipal councils in Sweden. In the 2014 general election the party polled 0.07% with 4,189 votes. The decision to disband came seven months later. History Party of the Swedes demonstrates in Stockholm The party was founded as Folkfronten (\"the people's front\") in November 2008 by members of the defunct National Socialist Front . The name of the party was changed in 2009 to avoid confusion and loss of votes in the 2010 election . When the party filed an application to the Election Authority of Sweden , it became apparent that a newly established socialist group had been registered under the same name only weeks before to block its use. In the 2010 elections, the party received 102 votes (2.8%) in the elections to municipal council in Gr\u00e4storp , giving them one mandate. According to the anti-racist watchdog magazine Expo , this made them the first Neo-Nazi party to win a seat in a Swedish political assembly since the end of World War II . At the second council meeting after the election, the policy for public tenders was to be decided; the initial proposal gave preference to bidders with higher health and safety standards and lower environmental impact. Party of the Swedes representative Daniel H\u00f6glund managed to gather support for an additional sentence stating that Swedish labourers and companies should be given preference over foreign bidders, given the potential differences in travel distance. Other representatives later told reporters from the newspaper Expressen that this had appeared innocuous, but when later reflecting upon the consequences they recanted the decision and ensured that his suggestion would not have any influence on tenders. A prerequisite for a mandate in Swedish municipal councils is residence in that municipality. After a few weeks and after the official records were reviewed, it was revealed that H\u00f6glund was registered as living in the neighbouring municipality and he was deprived of his seat. Though it had received no votes at all, the party gained another seat in Nykvarn Municipality , when an independent member joined the Party of the Swedes. The councilman had been elected for the National Democrats , who received two members in the election of 2010. The party gained a third councilman in the M\u00f6nster\u00e5s municipal council when a former representative for the Sweden Democrats joined the party. Two Sweden Democrats defected to the party in Hedemora city council, though one of them soon left the Party of the Swedes as well, reducing the number of active representatives to three. The only elected seat, in Gr\u00e4storp, remained unfilled. Following the general election in 2014, the party lost its only seat in the municipal council in Gr\u00e4storp .

{"id": "doc_random_296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compo_Simmonite", "text": "William Simmonite , better known by his nickname of Compo (from unemployment compensation , as in the phrase \"he's on the compo\", according to series writer Roy Clarke ), was a character in the world's longest-running sitcom, Last of the Summer Wine . Fictional character biography Early life Compo was born in 1919 into a poor, lower-class family in Holmfirth . He claims that his mother, a rag-and-bone woman , said that, immediately after he was born, the sun began to shine and that a swallow began to sing. Mentions of his father suggest Compo was born illegitimate from a brief liaison; Foggy stated of Compo's father that \"he was away before you got a good look at him... in fact, he was away before your mother got a good look at him\". Having once rigged Compo up to look like a kamikaze pilot, and impressed with the likeness, Clegg jokingly suggests Compo's father to have been Japanese, to which Compo replies \"Japanese? With a name like Withenshaw?\" indicating this to have been his father's surname and that the Simmonites are his mother's side of the family. He mentions that, according to his mother, his father was from Chesterfield. The Simmonite family is a large one. Compo had several encounters in his schooldays, which he remembers fondly \u2013 with the exception of one with Aggie Duckett who, he claims, \"used to make his nose bleed \". This was due to the fact that she was always thumping him because he laughed at her boots, not knowing they were her father's. His school friends included Norman Clegg ( Peter Sallis ), Cyril Blamire ( Michael Bates ), Walter \"Foggy\" Dewhurst ( Brian Wilde ), Seymour Utterthwaite ( Michael Aldridge ) and Herbert \"Truly\" Truelove ( Frank Thornton ). Love life Compo married soon after the war, but the marriage did not last long and he does not remember his wife, as she \"ran off with a chuffin' Pole !\" in 1947. He had several flings in his youth, one of which went to the next level and resulted in the birth of his son, Tom. Tom tracked his father down and wrote to him (mentioning Compo's two grandchildren, who \"went off in search of truth and wisdom with bits of metal through their nose\"), but he arrives in Holmfirth to meet him too late, just after his father's funeral. Out of loneliness, Compo once hired a housekeeper ( Liz Smith ). He takes her out for a meal at Sid's Caf\u00e9 and tries to start a relationship. However, she does a moonlight flit with all his newly-bought possessions. After his death, it is revealed that Compo went every Thursday to visit Regina \"Reggie\" Unsworth ( Liz Fraser ) to whom he left his ferrets. Nora Batty Despite never actually divorcing his wife, he has an unrequited love for his neighbour of many years, Nora Batty ( Kathy Staff ); they'd been neighbours since 1952. Despite constant reminders that it would never happen or, in earlier days, that she was married, Compo persisted in his attempts to elope with Nora. However, he may only like Nora because he knows it will not progress further. When Nora's downtrodden husband Wally ( Joe Gladwin ) announced that he was leaving her to emigrate to New Zealand , Compo immediately tried to step into Wally's place with an apparently willing Nora. Wally had told Compo privately that he was actually only going to his mother's for a few days and would be back soon. When Clegg and Blamire tricked Compo into believing that Wally was really emigrating and Nora was intent on marriage, he panicked and tried his hardest to remove Nora from the dinner to which he had invited her. Although Nora often gives Compo the hard end of her broomstick, she does often display concern or kindness towards him. When he cleans himself up during Wally's escape, she dresses up for a meal with him; when he disappears off a cliff on one of Foggy's wild schemes, she shows concern; when he is caught in one of Wesley Pegden's ( Gordon Wharmby ) exploding vehicles, she rushes forwards and tries to comfort him with a showing of her leg. Nora feels guilty when Compo dies in hospital with a smile on his face after suffering a heart attack when seeing her in unwrinkled stockings . She and Ivy sit up for the rest of the night, reminiscing about his various exploits. When Nora and Ivy go to visit Compo before his funeral in the Chapel of Rest, Nora is horrified that he still has the smile on his face, much to Ivy's amusement. Bill Owen said in an interview that Compo sees Nora as the Elizabeth Taylor of Holmfirth. Ivy Although his main aim in life was Nora, he also played his luck with the formidable owner of Sid's Caf\u00e9, Ivy ( Jane Freeman ). Although Ivy rejected his advances, her lumbering, coarse husband Sid ( John Comer ) does not try to stop him as he knows Compo does not mean anything by it. Whenever he tries to make advances to Ivy, the result is that he and his companions are thrown out of the caf\u00e9 or hit on the head with Ivy's metal tray. Said Compo in one episode, \"I'm just goin' to get me 'ead bashed with a tray.\" Ivy sometimes appreciates Compo's advances and, when he is not in the room, smiles superiorly. In the early episodes, when it seemed like Compo and the other two members of the trio were not getting hospitality or being welcomed in the Cafe, they would break out into a rendition of \" We'll Keep a Welcome \" much to Ivy's chagrin. Later years \"The joy of Bill Owen's Compo is not what he does with the words but where he takes the character beyond what's in the script. He did this in a physical manner. It was only when I saw Bill on screen that I realized what a wonderful physical clown he was.\" Roy Clarke on Bill Owen and Compo In his later life, Compo, Norman and a third man (such as Cyril or Foggy) roamed the hills around Holmfirth, getting involved with harebrained schemes to keep themselves one step ahead of boredom. Compo often talks of his vast, vast family and their exploits. He seems closest to Norman, as it is the third man who uses Compo as a guinea pig for their schemes. On one occasion Compo was repeatedly thrown backwards in the hope of getting a lift up a hill. Throughout the series, Compo always loved an argument with the third man; Cyril Blamire was perhaps the person he argued with the most. This was largely because Cyril viewed himself as superior to Compo (and occasionally Clegg) and made snide remarks about Compo's working class lifestyle more frequently than his successors. His right-wing political views contrasted to Compo's left wing views. (In real life Bill Owen's and Michael Bates's political views were similar to their onscreen characters and, in turn, both conflicted.) Despite this, Compo and Cyril were still close and Compo was very miserable about his departure. During Foggy's first stint, Compo frequently argued with him in a similar manner. This was largely due to Foggy's military background and, like the previous third man, Foggy often made insults of disgust over Compo's attire. He frequently referred to him as \"that man\". As a part of his schemes, Foggy also made Compo volunteer for often dangerous and ridiculous situations and, as a result, he was regularly harmed (though rarely injured) or humiliated. Foggy also commented on Compo not serving in World War 2. (In reality Bill Owen served in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps and was injured in an explosion during a training exercise). During Seymour's brief stint in the late 1980s, Compo was often made to test the former's inventions which frequently ended up in disaster for him and he called Seymour a twit whenever things went wrong. Despite this, Seymour was more willing to play along with Compo's childish antics than his predecessors were. When Seymour departed the show, Foggy returned at the beginning of the 1990s. During this time, Foggy was shown to have mellowed somewhat and as a result became more tolerant of Compo (though not always). It was during this period when perhaps Compo's most famous misfortune happened, in the series 15 episode \"Stop That Bath\". The trio were helping Howard transport a cast iron bath for Marina, by wheeling it on a cart through the streets . While trying to push the bath up a steep hill, Compo lost his balance and fell into the bath, causing the others to lose their grip on the cart which started speeding down the hill with Compo in the bath. The bath fell off the cart and crashed into a loose drain pipe, which soaked Compo. During Truly's stint on the show, Compo was similarly often involved in dangerous situations against his will. Though Truly was pompous like his predecessors, he eventually grew used to Compo's childish behaviour and the two did not argue frequently. Throughout Compo's time on the show, there were numerous references to Compo's vast family and their (implied) criminal tendencies. Although several relatives appeared in the show, this does not come close to the number of relatives mentioned lightly in conversation. By the time Compo\u2019s son Tom appeared in the series, it is said all of Compo\u2019s family have died. Death Bill Owen died of pancreatic cancer in 1999 and, the following year, the character of Compo was killed off following the broadcast of three episodes that Owen had already filmed. According to Truly and Clegg, Compo died from a heart attack after catching the sight of Nora Batty in chorus girl clothes. However, he died with a smile on his face (as confirmed by Truly, Clegg and Nora). He was buried alongside his signature Wellington boots . Clegg is disappointed at not being able to say goodbye personally, so Truly ( Frank Thornton ) arranges for an abundance of white painter's overalls to be laid out in a formation saying 'See Ya, Compo' on the opposite hill. All the other main characters \u2013 Wesley, Edie ( Dame Thora Hird ), Glenda ( Sarah Thomas ), Barry ( Mike Grady ), Howard ( Robert Fyfe ), Pearl ( Juliette Kaplan ), Marina ( Jean Fergusson ), Nora and Ivy \u2014 go to view it, in their different transport modes. Money Compo was always broke. He spent most of his life (presumably until he reached retirement age) in the unemployment queues , as the prospect of a job sent his skin white. He always relied on Clegg and whoever was completing the trio to supply him with cigarettes , ale and other such things. His lack of funds always surprises his friends , to the point when Compo is willing to get injured as it will end up with someone, usually Foggy, buying him a drink out of guilt or remorse. Although he married soon after the war, almost thirty years later he is still in an argument with the thirty- bob tailor who made his wedding suit. He cannot pay his television rental; the shop takes it back so frequently that he leaves his door unlocked so they can take it whenever necessary. In one episode, Foggy states that Compo owes him money and, in the episode in which Compo was buried, Truly remarks that he still owed him two quid and questioned Clegg if the money was in the letter he sent to him.

{"id": "doc_random_299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_State_Route_107", "text": "State Route 107 ( SR 107 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maine . It is a 16.33\u00a0mi (26.28\u00a0km) secondary route that connects the towns of Baldwin and Bridgton . The southern terminus is at State Route 11 and State Route 113 in Baldwin and the northern terminus is at State Route 117 in Bridgton. The highway runs through Cumberland County . Route description SR 107 begins in East Baldwin at SR 11 and SR 113 . It is overlapped with SR 11 for the southernmost 1.80 miles (2.90\u00a0km) of its length, following Bridgton Road due north between Woods Millpond and Sand Pond to an intersection with Sebago Road. SR 11 splits to the northeast onto Sebago Road while SR 107 continues north, continuing to follow Bridgton Road to Long Hill Road, where it enters Sebago . SR 107 turns northwest away from the nearby Sebago Lake , passing between Peabody Pond and Hancock Pond and traversing hilly terrain through the central part of town. The route then turns north again, entering the town of Bridgton . SR 107 runs through South Bridgton along South Bridgton Road before crossing Sandy Creek and ending at SR 117 , less than 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) west of U.S. Route 302 . History The SR 107 designation was originally applied in 1925 to a 75.6-mile (121.7\u00a0km) route running between SR 100 in downtown Auburn and Haines Landing in Rangeley . Most of this route was absorbed by SR 4 when it was designated in 1931, and all of it exists as the northernmost segment of SR 4 today. Modern SR 107 was designated in 1936 on a new route between SR 11 north of Baldwin and SR 117 in Bridgton, with an original length of 14.53 miles (23.38\u00a0km). In 1953, SR 107 was extended south along SR 11 to terminate at SR 113 in Baldwin. The route has not changed since. Junction list The entire route is in Cumberland County .
