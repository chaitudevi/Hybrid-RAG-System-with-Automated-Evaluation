Art Roger Bradfield won several art contests as a child and had early encouragement from his high school art teacher to pursue a career in the arts . His preferred medium is watercolor , although he has also proven himself to be proficient in pencil , pen and ink , and acrylic . Food products Bradfield worked on the General Mills cereal boxes of the early 1960s. These included children's cereals, such as Kix , Trix , Wheaties and Jets , among other work. He also worked on Mr Bubble and some projects for the Pillsbury Company . In 1964, he did the spot illustrations for the Bisquick Cookbook for the Bisquick baking product.

Children's books \"Jolly\" Roger Bradfield is perhaps best known for his work as a children's book author and illustrator. He began his writing career when he was teaching himself how to type . Bored with the tutorials of his text book , Bradfield chose to practice his typing by writing something fun. Thus, his first book There's an Elephant in the Bathtub was created. Bradfield went on to write and illustrate several other titles including Pickle-Chiffon Pie , Benjamin Dilley's Thirsty Camel , Giants Come in Different Sizes , The Flying Hockey Stick , and Benjamin Dilley's Lavender Lion . The \"Jolly\" Roger books are known mostly for their colorful illustrations and wildly imaginative stories.

Comics From 1972 to 1978, Bradfield worked as a newspaper syndicate cartoonist creating the daily and Sunday comic strip Dooley's World . The strip featured stories centering on a boy and his collection of living toys . These comics featured many unique visual gags and puns . The strip was distributed by King Features Syndicate . In addition to the little boy, Dooley, recurring characters were the Professor, a know-it-all wind-up toy figure, Norman, a sophisticated and reflective wind-up knight , Thelma, an unhappy and bullying rag doll , and Max, an introverted mouse . Paintings Bradfield created vibrant and colorful paintings. These paintings mostly depict subjects that he found on his world travels and playful and fun images that he conjured up with his imagination. His preferred medium was watercolor , but he also dabbled in acrylic , ink , and pencil . World travel He was also an extensive world traveller and visited and sketched in countries that include Greece , Norway , Portugal , France , Italy , Mexico , England , and Spain . On one trip to Mexico, Bradfield's plane had a minor accident resulting in some damage to the plane's wing tanks. So, he enlisted the help of some of the local children getting them to patch the damage up with large wads of bubble gum . The scheme did not work, as the gasoline melted the bubble gum, but the plane managed to reach its destination safely anyway. Personal life and death Bradfield and his wife, Joan, raised five children. He died on December 31, 2021, at the age of 97.

{"id": "doc_fixed_001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_John_Harbour_Bridge", "text": "The Saint John Harbour Bridge is three-span crossing of Saint John Harbour at the mouth of the Saint John River in Saint John , New Brunswick , Canada . It opened in 1968. History Proposals for a bridge crossing of the Saint John Harbour had been a debated topic as early as 1874. During a House of Commons session in April of that year, there was discussion of potentially introducing a harbour crossing via Navy Island . John Ferris , MP of Queen's at the time, opposed the Navy Island crossing and argued that such a bridge would be \"destructive to river craft,\" instead arguing that any harbour crossing should be placed at the Reversing Falls to be high enough to clear passing vessels. By the mid-20th century, the rate of industrial and residential growth in Saint John and surrounding communities necessitated a second bridge over the Saint John River. The old Reversing Falls Bridge was adequate for handling the post-War traffic growth; however public concerns about where to build a new highway and bridge frustrated the idea for many years. On May 1, 1961 the city's Common Council appointed a 6-member citizens' committee which then directed various studies and discussions. Ultimately, the bridge was built as a cooperative project between the federal, provincial and municipal governments. They decided to purchase the majority of the Mill Street Yard from the Canadian Pacific Railway for a new highway alignment which would run through the middle of the city downstream of Reversing Falls. The federally controlled National Harbours Board (now Ports Canada) would build the bridge. Part of this deal involved the NHB collecting a 25\u00a2 toll in each direction. Under the original act prevented any toll increase for forty years without federal, provincial and municipal agreement. . The bridge's construction had early critics, including K. C. Irving , who in 1965 critiqued the $18 million budget through publicly released letters addressed to the vice-chairman of the Harbour Bridge Authority, the Common Council , and the mayor. The selected location remains controversial as it prevents high-clearance vessels from navigating into the upper part of the Saint John Harbour. Construction of the bridge also drew to a close the status of Navy Island as an island within the Inner Harbour and resulted in the demolition of the historic neo- gothic Union Station. Earlier proposals had called for the Saint John Throughway and the bridge to be built north of the Reversing Falls gorge. Design and capacity Saint John Harbour Bridge was designed and built as a hollow box, haunched girder structure. It carries four lanes of traffic across 3 spans, measuring 125 metres (410\u00a0ft), 250 metres (820\u00a0ft), and 125 metres (410\u00a0ft). Contracts for the four main piers were signed in September 1965 and the crossing opened on August 17, 1968 as part of the ambitious Saint John Throughway project. The bridge in 2006 Tolls were set at 25 cents when the bridge was constructed. The Harbour Bridge Authority increased the cash-toll from $0.25 to $0.50 for regular commuter traffic beginning January, 2007. This is the first, and only, permitted rate increase since the bridge was built; however, by 2010, the tolls were eliminated, and the building later demolished. Transfer of authority Meanwhile, by 2010, more than forty years after the bridge was built, it was in need of more than $35 million worth of repairs. Without the necessary repairs, the Harbour Bridge Authority warned it would need to close two lanes of traffic and impose weight restrictions on the bridge, threatening to inhibit traffic flow during commute times as well as posing as a problem to transports coming to and from the bordering state of Maine, USA. The three levels of government negotiating the project's financing. On November 26, 2010 Stephen Harper and David Alward announced an agreement. It eliminated the toll and wiped away a $22.6 million debt, while the Federal Government agreed to pay for half of the $35 million structural repairs. The Bridge Authority was abolished and management of the bridge was placed under the New Brunswick Department of Transportation and Infrastructure . In 2013, the Department announced that it had sold the office building formerly used by the Bridge Authority to the Saint John Port Authority.

Jayd Johnson stars as the protagonist, Paddy Meehan, working for a Glasgow newspaper in the 1980s. Plot The first series of The Field of Blood adapts the novel of the same name, which is set in 1982. This series comprised two episodes, broadcast on BBC One on 8 and 9 May 2011, respectively. The second series adapts the follow-up novel, The Dead Hour , which is set later in the same decade. The second series was commissioned by the BBC in 2012, again containing two episodes, which aired on 8 and 9 August 2013, respectively. Set in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1982, a young female reporter sees an opportunity for a riveting story for her slowly dying city newspaper when a young boy is kidnapped from a Glasgow park and later is found murdered. She sees connections to a year-old prior murder with similar characteristics that nobody else wants to see, and she is determined to connect them and convince the police. Reception Time Out gave the second series four out of five stars and said \"It\u2019s good to see this grubby Glaswegian crime drama get another run \u2013 it slipped under the radar somewhat when it first appeared in 2011.\" Sarah Hughes of The Independent said \"While the television version of The Field of Blood lacks the sense of human fraility of the Denise Mina books on which it's based, occasionally seeming clunky in comparison, its great strength lies in the accurate portrayal of a distant, darker time.\" Sarah Rainey of The Daily Telegraph also gave it four out of five stars and said \"The opening half was bleak but authentic, from the clack-clack of the Olympia typewriters to the obligatory Irn Bru advert. ... The camerawork was clever \u2013 just the right amount of jumpy hand-held shots and haunting close-ups \u2013 and the dialogue was witty.\" Sarah Hughes, also writing for The Guardian , called the first series \"impressive\" and said it was \"a cut above the usual summer schedule-filling fare.\" Lucy Mangan, another journalist for The Guardian said \"this potent brew of corruption, conflict and car coats is nevertheless a waste of David Morrissey's talents\" when talking about the second series. Cast Episode list Series 1 (2011) Series 2 (2013) ^ In Gaelic, the letters MH\u00a0\u2013 when they appear together\u00a0\u2013 are pronounced V in English.

{"id": "doc_fixed_008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic-Man", "text": "This article is about the Headline Comics character. For the real-life technician who was exposed to americium radiation and became known as the Atomic Man, see Harold McCluskey . For the song by Portugal, The Man, see Evil Friends . Atomic-Man is an American superhero created by Charles Voight who appeared in Headline Comics from issue #16 (Nov/Dec 1945) to #21 (Sept/Oct 1946) which were published by Prize Comics . He is often credited for being the first atomic superhero. Origin story Dr. Adam Mann is experimenting with uranium-235 in the aftermath of the first atomic bomb being used in Hiroshima . During the experiment he finds himself being subjected to a strange side effect which changes his body. He finds that he has been changed into a new type of being, a being who was not only immune to most lethal radiations but was also immune to electricity, flame and even bullets. In addition to the change in his body he also found he now possessed many different powers. These superpowers of his included the ability to see radiations which were previously invisible to normal humans. His right hand also now also emitted a large amount of Gamma radiation which allowed him to perform a number of superhuman deeds like punching through brick walls using energy blasts and controlling the minds of other people. When not using his powers he wore a lead glove in his hand to curtail the powers of radiation so as not to harm others. Knowing that the element that had given him his powers could and would be used by others for evil he took the identity of Atomic-Man and dedicated himself to fighting those who might who would try to pervert its use, along with any other criminals, mad scientists or communists who fell under the glow of his right hand.

{"id": "doc_fixed_010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_%26_Legacy", "text": "V & Legacy were a hip hop duo who released the album 2000MG in 1999. History The duo comprised Vlad Radovanov (aka V, born c. 1971) and David Legacy. V originated from Chicago where he had been a member of the hip hop group East of the Rock, and travelled to Los Angeles in 1995, determined to succeed as a rapper. He began performing regularly at the Galaxy Gallery, where he met David Legacy, a local rapper from South Central Los Angeles . United in their dislike of the predominant gangsta rap , they joined forces and began working together, influenced by the likes of Pharcyde and The Freestyle Fellowship . They recorded demos while working their day jobs as a bank teller (Legacy) and cigarette shiller (V). They were finally rewarded with a deal by Flip Records , although they moved to X-Ray Records / Cleopatra Records for their debut release, the \"Lunatic Derelict\" 12-inch in 1999. This was followed by their debut album 2000MG later the same year, which featured guest appearances from George Clinton , DJ Lethal , and Sen Dog and BoBo of Cypress Hill . 2000MG was reissued on CD the following year, but proved to be their final release, although three tracks from the album appeared on the 2004 compilation Cypress Thrill (2004). An extended version of their track \"Monkey Mittens\" with George Clinton was included on the 2004 album A Tribute to Cassidy . V made a guest appearance on Free Murda 's 2007 album RZA Presents Free Murda: Let Freedom Reign . Radovanov later worked as an attorney and co-founded the Universal Records -distributed Cobra Music label in 2006. He has also been involved in film, acting as executive producer for Interloper Films on titles such as We Live in Public , which won the 2009 Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary at the Sundance Festival .

{"id": "doc_fixed_011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bruce_Ellis_Ranken", "text": "Covent Garden , a 1930 portrait by Ranken Portrait of Ernest Thesiger by Ranken in Manchester Art Gallery Warbrook House in Hampshire William Bruce Ellis Ranken (11 April 1881 \u2013 31 March 1941) was a British artist and Edwardian aesthete . Early life and education He was born in Edinburgh , Scotland, to Robert Burt Ranken , a wealthy and successful lawyer, and his wife Mary. He attended Eton College in Eton, Berkshire , and then the Slade School of Art , where he studied under the tutelage of Henry Tonks . A fellow student was the actor Ernest Thesiger , who became a lifelong friend; he was painted by Ranken in 1918, and married Ranken's sister Janette Ranken in 1917. Career Ranken's first exhibition in 1904 at the Carfax Gallery, managed by John Fothergill and William Rothenstein , in London was well received by artists and art critics. He befriended Wilfrid de Glehn and John Singer Sargent . At the outbreak of World War I , Ranken was living at his studio in Chelsea, a short distance from Sargent's studio, with whom he may have ventured to America during the war years. While in the United States, Sargent introduced him to Isabella Stewart Gardner , and he received commissions to paint portraits of the wealthy, including the Whitneys, Vanderbilts and Havermeyers. His output became prodigious as he worked in watercolors , oils and pastels . Returning to Britain in the 1920s, he painted many portraits of the British royal family and the aristocracy, as well as the interiors of their homes. In France during the World War I as a distraction from the trenches, he collected and repaired historical pieces of embroidery for sale with Ernest Thesiger who was invalided and, in 1917, married Ranken's sister, Janette Mary Fernie Ranken (1877-1970). In her biography of Thesiger's friend, Ivy Compton-Burnett , Hilary Spurling suggests that Thesiger and Janette wed largely out of their mutual adoration of Ranken, who shaved his head when he learned of the engagement. On the other hand, it has been said that Janette Ranken was in love with Compton-Burnett's companion, Margaret Jourdain , a fellow Oxford student. Janette Ranken left Jourdain to marry Thesiger. In 1918, Ranken purchased Warbrook House in Eversley, Hampshire , after the success of his first visit to the United States. The maintenance and costs associated with the property proved to be too much in the depression of the early 1930s, and he was forced to give up his beloved house. Ranken died suddenly in London in 1941 and was buried near Warbrook, at St Mary (the church is off the A327 road, about 2 miles from the A30). Public collections Following his unexpected death from a cerebral haemorrhage , his sister Janette gifted over 200 works to be distributed amongst UK public galleries and museums. Ranken's paintings are held in a large number of museum and public collections, including Southampton City Art Gallery , Portsmouth Museum, Bradford Museum, Reading Museum , Bristol Museum and Art Gallery , Northampton Museum , Derby Museum , Leeds City Museum , National Museums Northern Ireland , Glasgow Museums, City of Edinburgh Council and the Government Art Collection .

{"id": "doc_fixed_012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Antivirus", "text": "Personal Antivirus is rogue anti-virus software created by a company named Innovagest (sometimes referred to as \"Innovagest 2000\"), and is related to other rogue software. It claims to be an anti-virus program, but instead merely displays false warnings about virus and spyware infections, and demands money to clean these infections. Description A common way that Personal Antivirus installs itself on a computer is through a malicious pop-up ad (though it may also be installed as part of a malicious video codec package). When a user visits a website hosting a Personal Antivirus ad, a pop-up window appears, claiming to be scanning the computer for virus infections. This \"scan\" inevitably finds a number of virus infections. Afterward, the user is told that they need to buy Personal Antivirus to clean these infections, and is directed to a site that accepts payments. If the user decides to buy and install the program, Personal Antivirus claims to have repaired the infections, but also regularly advertises additional programs or demands more money at regular intervals. New York Times Web Site In September, 2009, the New York Times web site unwittingly started to randomly display ads related to Personal Antivirus. The New York Times uses a mix of in-house advertising and advertising networks to display ads on their web site. The person responsible for the ads originally requested that the New York Times run ads for Vonage VoIP service. Because Vonage had previously advertised directly with the New York Times, the ads were approved and were delivered via a third-party ad network that was unfamiliar to the Times. On September 11, 2009, the Vonage ads that were originally approved switched to Personal Antivirus ads. These ads continued to be displayed throughout the following weekend. The ads were eventually stopped when the New York Times temporarily disabled ads displayed by third-party networks and investigated the source of the Personal Antivirus ads. The New York Times later advised readers that using a reputable, properly-updated anti-virus program would likely resolve any lingering infections from Personal Antivirus. They also discovered that during the same weekend, other sites had experienced similar malicious ads, possibly including the web site of the San Francisco Chronicle . References ^ \"Aurelija\".

Episode Symone ( pictured at RuPaul's DragCon LA in 2022 ) win's the episode's main challenge. Kahmora Hall ( pictured at RuPaul's DragCon LA in 2022 ) is eliminated from the competition. In the Werk Room, the contestants in the \"winners\" group are joined by the other group. Elliott with 2 Ts initially hides behind a screen to avoid detection. The contestants talk about Elliott with 2 Ts, before she reveals herself. On a new day, RuPaul greets the merged group and reveals the main challenge, which tasks contestants with overacting in \"RuPaulmark Channel\" holiday movies. Following are the film titles and group members: Misery Love's Company \u2013 Denali , Elliott with 2 Ts , Kahmora Hall , and Olivia Lux God Loves Flags \u2013 LaLa Ri , Ros\u00e9 , Symone , and Utica Queen April Fool's Rush In \u2013 Gottmik , Joey Jay , Kandy Muse , Tamisha Iman , and Tina Burner The three films are Valentine's Day -, Flag Day -, and April Fools' Day -themed, respectively. The contestants break into groups, review the scripts, select their roles, and begin to rehearse. RuPaul returns to the Werk Room to meet with each group, asking questions and offering advice. RuPaul asks Utica Queen if she has smoked cannabis , prompting an ambiguous reply from the contestant and a hysterical laugh from RuPaul. RuPaul reveals the category for the fashion show (\"Trains for Days\"), then the contestants rehearse and film with Ross Mathews . Back in the Werk Room, the contestants make final preparations for the fashion show. Symone discusses going to prom in drag . Tamisha Iman reveals she has three biological children.

Kahmora Hall wears an outfit for green screen and portrays a tree. Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman appears in all three films; in April Fool's Rush In , he impersonates Prince . According to Billboard , Kahmora Hall's \"tight-fitting, luxuriously accessorized train gown ... would prove to be fatal\" in her lip-sync against Denali. Stephen Daw wrote, \"with her movements hindered, Hall was forced to do her best by walking around the stage while Denali kicked, split, and duck-walked her way back into the competition\". Denali has said of her performance: \"That style of music means a lot to me, and it\u2019s the proudest moment I had on the show!\" Love was later a guest judge on the season's sixth (\" Disco-mentary \"), tenth (\" Freaky Friday Queens \"), and twelfth (\" Nice Girls Roast \") episodes, as well as the fourteenth season 's fourth episode (\" She's a Super Tease \"). Fashion Utica Queen 's runway outfit was inspired by the Curtain Dress ( pictured on display at the National Museum of American History ) designed by Bob Mackie and worn by Carol Burnett during the \" Went with the Wind! \" comedy sketch that originally aired on The Carol Burnett Show in 1976. Inspired by Quetzalcoatl and the quetzal bird , Denali's runway look was described by Kate Kulzick of The A.V Club as \"full Carnival in a bright, feathered leotard with big structured shoulders, a tall, colorful Mohawk wig, and a massive ostrich feather train\". Olivia Lux wears a tall white wig, a coatdress and long train, and a lavender ruffled neck piece with matching boots. Elliott with Two Ts has a white lace bodysuit and a white studded belt, a white ruffled train made of tulle , and tall blonde hair. Kahmora Hall's gold dress has two dragon heads as shoulder pieces, and a dragon tail train in the back. Symone wears a corset and jumpsuit , with a durag that becomes a train. LaLa Ri wears a belted coat, a bodysuit, and thigh-high boots . Inspired by the \" Went with the Wind! \" comedy sketch that originally aired on The Carol Burnett Show on CBS in 1976, Utica Queen wears a \"hoop dress complete with curtain rod and pull tie belt\". Ros\u00e9's look has been described as a \"true blue pantsuit with striking white lapels and a tall white curled Mohawk with a giant blue tulle train\". Gottmik uses a bedazzled leaf blower for wind effects, and Tina Burner's look resembles the uniform of a train conductor . Joey Jay wears a red braid, and Kandy Muse has a red corset. Tamisha Iman wears a pink bodysuit and train. Reception Kate Kulzick of The A.V Club gave the episode a rating of 'B+'. Entertainment Weekly said Kimora Hall \"made herstory as the queen who looked the best during her elimination\". Denali's performance during the lip-sync received both praise and negative criticism, with various outlets consider it among the show's best. Queerty said Denali \"stunned\" during the performance. The lip-sync caused \"100% Pure Love\" to re-enter the Billboard charts . References ^ \" 'RuPaul's Drag Race' Season 13, Episode 4 recap: We made it to the merge!\" . Xtra Magazine .

Once it has reached Chilumba, it starts its travel back to its base in Lusumbwe in the Southern Region of Malawi. Heterogeneity in landscape gives Chilumba a unique environment for diversification of recreation and production activities. From the lake side, it is one of the unique places with Chirwa Island and Chitende Island, that host several species of plants, birds and fishes. The Islands are used by fishermen as temporary docking points. The peninsula facing Chirwa is a typical feature with rocky shore with deep waters potentially suitable for rock diving. The bay facing the jetty has shallow waters for docking boats and potential for shallow water walking to 50m then swim into deep waters facing the Chitende Peninsula and Mphiri hills. West of the peninsula lies a 3 kilometres (2\u00a0mi) stretch of pure sand beach. The sand extends upland a distance of about 1 kilometre (1\u00a0mi) and magnificently looks like a desert of dark sand separated by two swamps. The upper land away from the lake is prime agricultural land used during the 1980s to early 1990s as a maize seed production diversification scheme. Behind lies a natural boundary of forest reserve that extends to the lake through Mphiri hills to the north, ideal for horse riding.

{"id": "doc_fixed_022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huddersfield_R.U.F.C.", "text": "Huddersfield Rugby Union Football Club is an English rugby union club based in Huddersfield , West Yorkshire , England. The team plays in Regional 1 North East following their relegation from National League 2 North at the end of the 2023\u201324 season. The club also competes in the Yorkshire Cup competition and play its home matches at Lockwood Park, which has a capacity of 1,500 with seating for 500. HRUFC also has an academy squad, feeding the senior team with new players. History Rugby football was first played in Huddersfield in 1869 and the club established in 1870. Matches were initially played at the Rifle Field in Trinity Street and then, with the amalgamation of the St John's Cricket Club, at Fartown from 1879. Huddersfield was playing in the top ranks of English clubs when, in August 1895, the town hosted a meeting at the George Hotel and was one of the twenty clubs that resigned from the Rugby Union to set up The Northern Rugby Football Union, which allowed players to be compensated for 'Broken Time.' This meant they could claim for wages lost by playing on Saturdays. They were not allowed to make a living from the game \u2013 they were not 'professional.' A new club was re-formed and named Huddersfield Old Boys in 1909. The club's first ground was at the United Cricket Club in Luck Lane with changing facilities at the Croppers Arms. World War I blew the whistle on the sport and games were not restarted until 1919 on a ground at Salendine Nook initially before the club took a lease on land at Waterloo . It was here that the club established their current colours of white, claret and gold. A stand was built and changing rooms completed for exclusive rugby use a luxury in those days. But the ground was plagued with drainage problems and another move was contemplated. In the event it was decided to buy the ground outright for \u00a3700 and invest in drainage. In 1935 \u00a3370 was invested in a new pavilion and bar and ladies were welcomed to a hitherto male bastion and they themselves began the tradition of post-match tea making. By 1964 the original pavilion was falling to bits and a new one, costing \u00a311,000, was officially opened by Huddersfield's then MP J P W Mallalieu, himself a former Oxford Blue. In 1946 the club changed their name to Huddersfield Rugby Union Football Club. The club sold part of its Waterloo property for \u00a31.4\u00a0million to W Morrison's to help fund the purchase of the 26-acre (110,000\u00a0m 2 ) former brewery estate at Lockwood Park from Bass in 1996 to create a major sports complex backed by a \u00a31.84\u00a0million Sport Council lottery grant. The club won the Yorkshire Cup in 2011 for the first time, beating Hull RUFC 25\u201318 at York RUFC. The Huddersfield team which won the cup in 1890 was the direct antecedent of the Huddersfield Giants and is unconnected to the current Huddersfield RUFC.

{"id": "doc_fixed_026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_division)", "text": "\"H\u00e4rad\" redirects here. For the Swedish locality, see H\u00e4rad, Sweden . A hundred is an administrative division that is geographically part of a larger region. It was formerly used in England, Wales, some parts of the United States, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, and in Cumberland County in the British Colony of New South Wales . It is still used in other places, including in Australia (in South Australia and the Northern Territory ). Other terms for the hundred in English and other languages include wapentake , herred (Danish and Bokm\u00e5l Norwegian ), herad ( Nynorsk Norwegian ), h\u00e4rad or hundare (Swedish), Harde (German), hiird ( North Frisian ), kihlakunta (Finnish), kihelkond (Estonian), and cantref (Welsh). In Ireland, a similar subdivision of counties is referred to as a barony , and a hundred is a subdivision of a particularly large townland (most townlands are not divided into hundreds). Etymology The origin of the division of counties into hundreds is described by the Oxford English Dictionary as \"exceedingly obscure\". It may once have referred to an area of 100 hides ; in early Anglo-Saxon England a hide was the amount of land farmed by and required to support a peasant family, but by the 11th century in many areas it supported four families. Alternatively the hundred may have been an area originally settled by one \"hundred\" men at arms, or the area liable to provide one \"hundred\" men under arms. In this early medieval use, the number term \"hundred\" can be unclear, meaning the \"short\" hundred (100) or in some contexts the long hundred of 120. There was an equivalent traditional Germanic system. In Old High German a huntari is a division of a gau , but the Oxford English Dictionary states that the link between the two is not established. England See also: List of hundreds of England Administrative functions Hundreds of Cornwall in the early 19th century From the 11th century in England \u2013 and to a lesser extent from the 16th century in Wales \u2013 to the middle of the 19th century, the annual assemblies had varying degrees of power at a local level in the feudal system . Of chief importance was their more regular use for taxation, and six centuries of taxation returns for the divisions survive to this day. Groupings of divisions, small shires , were used to define parliamentary constituencies from 1832 to 1885. On the redistribution of seats in 1885 a different county subdivision, the petty sessional division , was used. Hundreds were also used to administer the first five national censuses from 1801 to 1841. The system of county divisions was not as stable as the system of counties being established at the time, and lists frequently differ on how many hundreds a county had. In many parts of the country, the Domesday Book contained a radically different set of divisions from that which later became established. The numbers of divisions in each county varied widely. For example Leicestershire had six (up from four at Domesday), whereas Devon , nearly three times the size, had 32. By the end of the 19th century, several single-purpose subdivisions of counties, such as poor law unions , sanitary districts , and highway districts , had sprung up, which, together with the introduction of urban districts and rural districts in 1894, mostly replaced the role of the parishes, and to a lesser extent the less extensive role of hundreds. The division names gave their name to multiple modern local government districts . Description Map of the Hundreds of Staffordshire , c. 1650. North is to the right. In southern and western England, a hundred was the division of a shire for military and judicial purposes under the common law , which could have varying extent of common feudal ownership, from complete suzerainty to minor royal or ecclesiastical prerogatives and rights of ownership. Until the introduction of districts by the Local Government Act 1894 , hundreds were the only widely used assessment unit intermediate in size between the parish, with its various administrative functions, and the county, with its formal ceremonial functions. The term \"hundred\" is first recorded in the 10th-century laws of King Edmund I as a measure of land and the area served by a hundred court. In the Midlands , they often covered an area of about 100 hides, but this did not apply in the south; this may suggest that it was an ancient West Saxon measure that was applied rigidly when Mercia became part of the newly established English kingdom in the 10th century. The Hundred Ordinance , which dates to the middle of the 10th century, provides that the court was to meet monthly, and thieves were to be pursued by all the leading men of the district. During Norman times, the hundred would pay geld based on the number of hides. To assess how much everyone had to pay, a clerk and a knight were sent by the king to each county; they sat with the shire- reeve (or sheriff ) of the county and a select group of local knights. There would be two knights from each hundred. After it was determined what geld had to be paid, the bailiff and knights of the hundred were responsible for getting the money to the sheriff and the sheriff for getting it to the Exchequer . Above the hundred was the shire, under the control of a sheriff. Hundred boundaries were independent of both parish and county boundaries, although often aligned, meaning that a hundred could be split between counties, or a parish could be split between hundreds. Exceptionally, in the counties of Kent and Sussex , there was a subdivision intermediate in size between the hundred and the shire: several hundreds were grouped together to form lathes in Kent and rapes in Sussex. At the time of the Norman Conquest , Kent was divided into seven lathes and Sussex into four rapes. Hundred courts Over time, the principal functions of the hundred became the administration of law and the keeping of the peace. By the 12th century, the hundred court was held twelve times a year. This was later increased to fortnightly, although an ordinance of 1234 reduced the frequency to once every three weeks. In some hundreds, courts were held at a fixed place; while in others, courts moved with each sitting to a different location. The main duty of the hundred court was the maintenance of the frankpledge system. The court was formed of twelve freeholders , or freemen. According to a 13th-century statute, freeholders did not have to attend their lord's manorial courts, thus any suits involving them would be heard in a hundred court. For especially serious crimes, the hundred was under the jurisdiction of the Crown; the chief magistrate was a sheriff, and his circuit was called the sheriff's tourn . However, many hundreds came into private hands, with the lordship of the hundred being attached to the principal manor of the area and becoming hereditary. Historian Helen Cam estimates that even before the Conquest, over 130 hundreds were in private hands; while an inquest of 1316 found that by that date 388 of 628 named hundreds were held by the king's subjects. Where a hundred was under a lord, a steward \u2013 acting as a judge and the chief official of the lord of the manor \u2013 was appointed in place of a sheriff. The importance of the hundred courts declined from the 17th century, and most of their powers were extinguished with the establishment of county courts in 1867. The remaining duty of the inhabitants of a hundred to make good damages caused by riot was ended by the Riot (Damages) Act 1886 , when the cost was transferred to the county police rate. The jurisdiction of hundred courts was curtailed by the Administration of Justice Act 1977 . Chiltern Hundreds By law in the United Kingdom , a member of parliament (MP) cannot resign their seat , but will be disqualified from sitting if appointed to an \" office of profit under the Crown\". A Crown Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds was appointed to maintain law and order in the area, but these duties ceased to be performed in the 16th century, and the holder ceased to gain any benefits during the 17th century. The position remains in use as a procedural device, with MPs wishing to resign appointed as Crown Stewards. Wapentake A wapentake, an Old Norse \u2013derived term as common in Northern England , was the equivalent of the Anglo-Saxon hundred in the northern Danelaw . In the Domesday Book the term is used instead of hundreds in Yorkshire , the Five Boroughs of Derby , Leicester , Lincoln , Nottingham and Stamford , and also sometimes in Northamptonshire. The laws in wapentakes were similar to those in hundreds with minor variations. According to the 1st-century historian Tacitus , in Scandinavia the wapentake referred to a vote passed at an assembly by the brandishing of weapons. In some counties, such as Leicestershire, the wapentakes recorded at the time of Domesday Book later evolved into hundreds. In others, such as Lincolnshire , the term remained in use. Although no longer part of local government, there is some correspondence between the rural deanery and the former wapentake or hundred; especially in the East Midlands, the Buckingham Archdeaconry and the York Diocese. Wales See also: List of hundreds of Wales Medieval cantrefi of Wales In Wales an ancient Celtic system of division called cantrefi (a hundred farmsteads; singular cantref ) had existed for centuries and was of particular importance in the administration of the Welsh law . The antiquity of the cantrefi is demonstrated by the fact that they often mark the boundary between dialects . Some were originally kingdoms in their own right; others may have been artificial units created later. With the coming of Christianity, the llan (similar to the parish) based Celtic churches often took the borders of the older cantrefi, and the same happened when Norman 'hundreds' were enforced on the people of Wales. Each cantref had its own court, which was an assembly of the uchelwyr , the main landowners of the cantref . This would be presided over by the king if he happened to be present, or if he was not present, by his representative. Apart from the judges there would be a clerk, an usher and sometimes two professional pleaders. The cantref court dealt with crimes, the determination of boundaries, and inheritance. Nordic countries See also: Hundreds of Denmark See also: List of hundreds of Sweden Map of medieval Denmark, showing herreder and sysler . The entire country was divided into herreder , shown outlined in red. Coloured areas show Jutland's syssel divisions. Zealand's four ecclesiastic sysler are not included. The term hundare ( hundred ) was used in Svealand and present-day Finland. The name is assumed to mean an area that should organise 100 men to crew four rowed war boats, which each had 12 pairs of oars and a commander. Eventually, that division was superseded by introducing the h\u00e4rad or Herred , which was the term in the rest of the Nordic countries . This word was derived from either Proto-Norse * harja-rai\u00f0\u014d (warband) or Proto-Germanic * harja-rai\u00f0a (war equipment, cf. wapentake) . Similar to skipreide , a part of the coast where the inhabitants were responsible for equipping and manning a war ship. Hundreds were not organized in Norrland , the northern sparsely populated part of Sweden. In Sweden, a countryside h\u00e4rad was typically divided into a few socken units (parish), where the ecclesiastical and worldly administrative units often coincided. This began losing its basic significance through the Swedish municipal reform of 1862. A h\u00e4rad was originally a subdivision of a landskap (province), but since the government reform of 1634, l\u00e4n (\"county\") took over all administrative roles of the province. A h\u00e4rad functioned also as electoral district for one peasant representative during the Riksdag of the Estates (Swedish parliament 1436\u20131866). The h\u00e4radsr\u00e4tt ( assize court ) was the court of first instance in the countryside, abolished in 1971 and superseded by tingsr\u00e4tt (modern district courts ). Today, the hundreds serve no administrative role in Sweden, although some judicial district courts still bear the name (e.g. Attunda tingsr\u00e4tt ) and the hundreds are occasionally used in expressions, e.g. Sjuh\u00e4radsbygden (district of seven hundreds). It is not entirely clear when hundreds were organised in the western part of Finland. The name of the province of Satakunta , roughly meaning hundred ( sata meaning \"one hundred\" in Finnish), hints at influences from the times before the Northern Crusades , Christianization , and incorporation into Sweden. As kihlakunta , hundreds remained the fundamental administrative division for the state authorities until 2009. Each was subordinated to a l\u00e4\u00e4ni (province/county) and had its own police department, district court and prosecutors. Typically, cities would comprise an urban kihlakunta by themselves, but several rural municipalities would belong to a rural kihlakunta . In a rural hundred the lensmann (chief of local state authorities) was called nimismies (\"appointed man\"), or archaically vallesmanni (from Swedish). In the Swedish era (up to 1809), his main responsibilities were maintenance of stagecoach stations and coaching inns , supplying traveling government personnel with food and lodging, transport of criminal prisoners, police responsibilities, arranging district court proceedings ( tingsr\u00e4tt ), collection of taxes, and sometimes arranging hunts to cull the wolf and bear population. Following the abolition of the provinces as an administrative unit in 2009, the territory for each authority could be demarcated separately, i.e. police districts need not equal court districts in number. The title \"h\u00e4rad\" survives in the honorary title of herastuomari (Finnish) or h\u00e4radsdomare (Swedish), which can be given to lay judges after 8\u201310 years of service. The term herred or herad was used in Norway between 1863 and 1992 for rural municipalities, besides the term kommune (heradskommune). Today, only three municipalities in western Norway call themselves herad : Ulvik herad Kvam herad , and Voss herad . Some Norwegian places have the word herad in their name, of historical reasons such as Kr\u00f8dsherad and Heradsbygd in Norway. United States Counties in Delaware , New Jersey and Pennsylvania were divided into hundreds in the 17th century, following the English practice familiar to the colonists. They survive in Delaware and were used as tax reporting and voting districts until the 1960s but now serve no administrative role: their only official legal use is in real estate title descriptions. Following American independence, the term \"hundred\" fell out of favor and was replaced by \"election district\". However, the names of the old hundreds continue to show up in deeds for another 50 years. Some plantations in Colonial Virginia used the term hundred in their names, such as Martin's Hundred , Flowerdew Hundred , and West and Shirley Hundred . Bermuda Hundred was the first incorporated town in Virginia; it was founded by Sir Thomas Dale in 1613, six years after Jamestown . While debating what became the Land Ordinance of 1785 , Thomas Jefferson 's committee wanted to divide the public lands in the west into \"hundreds of ten geographical miles square, each mile containing 6086 and 4-10ths of a foot\". The legislation instead introduced the six-mile square township of the Public Land Survey System . The hundred was used as a division of the county in Maryland . Carroll County was formed in 1836 by taking hundreds from Baltimore County and from Frederick County . Somerset County , which was established in 1666, was initially divided into six hundreds: Mattapony , Pocomoke, Boquetenorton, Wicomico, and Baltimore Hundreds; later subdivisions of the hundreds added five more: Pitts Creek, Acquango, Queponco, Buckingham, and Worcester Hundreds. The original borders of Talbot County (founded at some point prior to 12 February 1661 ) contained nine hundreds: Treadhaven Hundred, Bolenbroke Hundred, Mill Hundred, Tuckahoe Hundred, Worrell Hundred, Bay Hundred, Island Hundred, Lower Kent Island Hundred, Chester Hundred. In 1669 Chester Hundred was given to Kent County. In 1707 Queen Anne's County was created from the northern parts of Talbot County, reducing the latter to seven hundreds (Lower Kent Island Hundred becoming a part of the former). Of these, only Bay Hundred legally remains in existence, as District 5 in Talbot County. The geographic region, which includes several unincorporated communities and part of present-day Saint Michaels , continues to be known by the name Bay Hundred, with state and local governments using the name in ways ranging from water trail guides to community pools, while local newspapers regularly use the name in reporting news. Australia Main article: Lands administrative divisions of Australia In South Australia, land titles record in which hundred a parcel of land is located. Similar to the notion of the South Australian counties listed on the system of titles, hundreds are not generally used when referring to a district and are little known by the general population, except when transferring land title. When the land in the region of the present Darwin, in the Northern Territory, was first surveyed, the territory was administered by South Australia, and the surveyed land was divided up into hundreds. The Cumberland County ( Sydney ) was also allocated hundreds in the nineteenth century, although these were later repealed. A hundred is traditionally one hundred square miles or 64,000 acres (26,000\u00a0ha), although this is often not exact as boundaries often follow local topography.

It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19235. Rhyme The version given by The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes is: Round and round the garden Like a teddy bear; One step, two step, Tickle you under there! Origins The rhyme was first collected in Britain in the late 1940s. Since teddy bears did not come into vogue until the twentieth century it is likely to be fairly recent in its current form, but Iona and Peter Opie suggest that it is probably a version of an older rhyme, \"Round about there\": Round about there Sat a little hare, The bow-wows came and chased him Right up there! Accompanying actions The adult reciting the verse starts by tracing an index finger in circles on the child's upturned palm, then walks their fingers up the arm with each \"step\", ending with a tickle under the child's arm.

{"id": "doc_fixed_029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Michigan_UFO_event", "text": "On March 8, 1994, multiple individuals reported a sighting of multiple UFOs in West Michigan , United States. The UFOs were described as resembling flickering Christmas lights , consisting of five or six objects, cylindrically shaped or circles with blue, red, white and green lights. Radar data On March 11, press covered comments from the official in charge at the local National Weather Service office, who acknowledged radar data suggesting a \"fast moving phenomenon\" over Lake Michigan on March 8; He reported the sighting to the National UFO Reporting Center. He relayed eyewitness reports that featured \"red and green sets of lights\" which performed \"some rather erratic movements at times\". The sightings were reported to 9-1-1 and were observed by police and a National Weather Service radar at Muskegon County Airport . Witnesses Reports of sightings of March 8 were followed by a subsequent \" UFO flap \". According to Chicago Tribune , in the aftermath, UFO sightings were reported by over 300 witnesses in 42 counties of Michigan (including Muskegon , Ottawa , Berrien and Allegan counties). Interpretations On March 20, experts from the National Weather Service dismissed the radar blips , noting their radar is designed to sense weather not aircraft. Press speculated that the sightings could have been caused by a top-secret US aircraft, though aviation experts expressed skepticism. Press similarly covered a psychologist who opined the sightings were caused by social contagion , likening them to apparitions of Mary the mother of Jesus in stains on a water tower. The Detroit Free Press reported that residents of the very-religious Holland, Michigan were interpreting the sightings as a biblical sign. Assessment by the Mutual UFO Network By March 20, the Mutual UFO Network spokesperson told press they had received over 100 UFO reports in lower Michigan since the initial sightings on March 8. The group interviewed dozens of witnesses, but the event remains unexplained. The group claims to have ruled out most earthly explanations, such as a small plane, gas, blimp, weather balloon, satellite, shooting star, military aircraft or debris. Radar operator In 1996, Jack Bushong, the radar operator that night, began speaking publicly about the incident. Bushong recalled having been called by a 911 dispatcher around 10 that night. In 2008, he appeared on the show \"UFO Hunters\" In 2019, on the 25th anniversary of the event, local media interviewed witness Cindy Pravda. In 2020, retired meteorologist Jack Bushong was interviewed about his experiences at the National Weather Service station the night of March 8, 1994. In 2021, Bushong reported that he \"felt vindicated\" by a recent government UFO report. The event was detailed on an episode of the Netflix series Unsolved Mysteries in 2022; Bushong was featured. In 2024, Bushong recalled using the WSR-74C radar to scan the skies in response to dispatcher call. References ^ a b \"Retired meteorologist shares his account of 1994 West Michigan UFO sightings\" .

Exemption of $3,000 for a single filer, $4,000 for a married couple, and $4,000 for a head of household. Inflation-adjusted numbers Report of payments The War Revenue Act of 1917 required every entity to report certain payments made to another entity. Payments subject to reporting included payments of interest, rent, salaries, wages, premiums, annuities, compensation, remuneration, emoluments, or other fixed or determinable gains, profits, and income. Payments to an entity were required to be reported if the payments totaled at least $800 during the year. The payor was required to report the name and address of the payee and the total amount of payments on Form 1099 and sent to the Internal Revenue Service by March 1 of the year following the payments.

{"id": "doc_fixed_035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Green_(novelist)", "text": "Sarah Green ( fl . 1790 \u2013 1825) was an Irish-English author, one of the ten most prolific novelists of the first two decades of the nineteenth century. Life and writing Green was probably born in Ireland and then later moved to London . Very little is known of her aside from what has been pieced together of her publishing history. She produced works in an array of genres: novels, tales, romances, and, notably, like Jane Austen , mock-romances. She also wrote at least one religious work, as well as conduct literature, a translation, and editing work. Eight of her works were published with the popular Minerva Press by William Lane or his successor, Anthony Newman. \"It is ironic,\" one commentator has written, that her moral tract, Mental improvement for a young lady (1793) \"condemns all novels save those of Fanny Burney .\" Later works, however, engage with a range of other writers: in Scotch Novel Reading (1824), in addition to Burney, Green variously refers to or evokes Lord Byron , Charlotte Dacre , Charlotte Lennox , Sydney Owenson , Ann Radcliffe , and Walter Scott . Her Private History of the Court of England (privately printed, 1808) is a fictionalized account of the life of writer Mary Robinson . Initially Green published anonymously, but after 1810 she began to publish under her own name.

{"id": "doc_fixed_036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_B%C3%A1thory", "text": "Gabriel B\u00e1thory ( Hungarian : B\u00e1thory G\u00e1bor ; 15 August\u00a0[ O.S. 5 August]\u00a01589 \u2013 27 October 1613) was Prince of Transylvania from 1608 to 1613. The Ottomans nicknamed him \"Deli Kiral\" (Mad King). Born to the Roman Catholic branch of the B\u00e1thory family , he was closely related to four rulers of the Principality of Transylvania (a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire which had developed in the eastern territories of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary ). His father, Stephen B\u00e1thory , held estates in the principality, but never ruled it. Being a minor when his father died in 1601, Gabriel became the ward of the childless Stephen B\u00e1thory , from the Protestant branch of the family, who converted him to Calvinism . After inheriting most of his guardian 's estates in 1605, Gabriel became one of the wealthiest landowners in Transylvania and Royal Hungary (a realm of the Habsburg Empire which included the northern and western parts of medieval Hungary). Gabriel made an alliance with the Hajd\u00fas \u2014irregular troops stationing along the borders of Transylvania and Royal Hungary\u2014and laid claim to Transylvania against the elderly prince, Sigismund R\u00e1k\u00f3czi in February 1608. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi abdicated and the Diet of Transylvania elected Gabriel prince without resistance. Both the Sublime Porte and the Habsburg ruler Matthias II acknowledged Gabriel's election. He ignored the privileges of the Transylvanian Saxons and captured their wealthiest town, Szeben (now Sibiu in Romania), provoking an uprising in 1610. His attempts to expand his authority over the Ottoman vassal Wallachia and his negotiations with Matthias II outraged the Ottoman Sultan Ahmed I . The Sultan decided to replace Gabriel with an exiled Transylvanian nobleman, Gabriel Bethlen , and sent troops to invade the principality in August 1613. Transylvania was unable to resist and the Diet dethroned Gabriel. He was murdered by Hajd\u00fa assassins. Early life Childhood Ruins of the B\u00e1thorys' castle at Szil\u00e1gysomly\u00f3 (now \u0218imleu Silvaniei in Romania) B\u00e1thory was born in V\u00e1rad (now Oradea in Romania) before dawn on 15 August 1589. His father, Stephen B\u00e1thory , was a cousin of Prince of Transylvania Sigismund B\u00e1thory . Stephen was captain of V\u00e1rad when Gabriel was born. Gabriel's mother was his father's first wife, Zsuzsanna Bebek. Although she had already given birth to four children, none survived infancy. Sigismund B\u00e1thory dismissed Gabriel's father from V\u00e1rad in the summer of 1592, and Gabriel's family then moved to the B\u00e1thorys' ancient castle in Szil\u00e1gysomly\u00f3 (now \u0218imleu Silvaniei in Romania). The Principality of Transylvania emerged after the disintegration of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary in the 1540s. The principality included the eastern and northeastern regions of the medieval kingdom and its princes paid a yearly tribute to the Ottoman sultans. The princes were elected by the Diet, but they were to seek the Ottoman sultans' confirmation to rule the principality. The Habsburg kings of Royal Hungary regarded the principality as a part of their realm and the first rulers of the principality acknowledged the Habsburgs' claim in secret treaties in the 1570s. The Diet of Transylvania consisted primarily of the representatives of the Three Nations (that is the Hungarian noblemen , the Saxon burghers and the Sz\u00e9kelys ). Sigismund B\u00e1thory, who was a devout Catholic, wanted to join the Holy League of Pope Clement VIII against the Ottoman Empire , but most Transylvanian noblemen opposed his plan. Stephen B\u00e1thory's brother, Balthasar , was an opposition leader. Balthasar was captured and murdered at Sigismund's order in late August 1594. Gabriel's father fled from Transylvania to Poland, leaving his family behind in Szil\u00e1gysomly\u00f3; the five-year-old Gabriel was imprisoned with his mother and newborn sister, Anna . Stephen and Balthasar's brother, Cardinal Andrew B\u00e1thory (who lived in Poland), persuaded Pope Clement VIII to intervene on their behalf. Gabriel, his mother and sister were freed at the pope's request and were allowed to join Stephen in Poland. His mother became seriously ill, and died near the end of 1595. The Ottomans routed the armies of the Holy League in a series of battles after 1595. Sigismund B\u00e1thory abdicated in favor of Gabriel's uncle, Andrew, in early 1599 in the hope that Andrew could regain the Ottoman sultans' favor with Polish mediation. Gabriel's father accompanied Andrew back to Transylvania, and his family followed him. Michael the Brave , Prince of Wallachia , who had joined the Holy League, invaded Transylvania and defeated Andrew with the assistance of Sz\u00e9kely troops. After Sz\u00e9kely commoners murdered Andrew, Michael the Brave took possession of Transylvania. Gabriel's father fled to K\u0151v\u00e1r (now Remetea Chioarului in Romania) and swore fealty to the Holy Roman Emperor , Rudolph (who was also king of Hungary ), before his death on 21 February 1601. In guardianship The orphaned Gabriel and Anna were placed in the guardianship of their father's childless cousin, Stephen B\u00e1thory , and lost most of their father's estates; Szil\u00e1gysomly\u00f3 was seized by the royal treasury, and their scattered estates in Szatm\u00e1r , Szabolcs and Kraszna Counties were seized by a distant cousin, Peter Szaniszl\u00f3fi. Scholar J\u00e1nos Czegl\u00e9di educated Gabriel in Nagyecsed , and the wealthy Stephen B\u00e1thory converted Gabriel from Catholicism to Calvinism. Gabriel pledged that he would expel Catholics, Lutherans and Unitarians from his estates. The young Gabriel's strength was legendary, and he was said to break horseshoes with his bare hands. Rudolf's troops occupied Transylvania in 1603 and his officials started to confiscate the estates of noblemen through legal proceedings on false charges of treason. One of the wealthiest landowners, Stephen Bocskai , was accused of maintaining secret correspondence with Transylvanian exiles in 1604. To avoid imprisonment, he rose up in open rebellion with the backing of the Hajd\u00fa, irregular troops stationed along the borders of Transylvania and Royal Hungary. Although Stephen B\u00e1thory did not openly support Bocskai, he sent Gabriel to Bocskai's court in Kassa. Sixteen-year-old Gabriel participated in a battle against the royal army near S\u00e1rospatak in early February 1605; three years later, poet J\u00e1nos Rimay accused him of fleeing the battlefield. Rimay also said that Gabriel spent his days mainly drinking wine and allegedly had an affair with his aunt, Kata Iffj\u00fa (who was over thirty years old at the time). Rise to power Bocskai was elected prince of Transylvania on 21 February 1605 and prince of Hungary on 20 April of that year. His realm included most of Transylvania proper, Partium and Upper Hungary . Stephen B\u00e1thory died on 25 July 1605. He had willed most of his estates to Gabriel, who became one of the wealthiest noblemen in Bocskai's realm. Bocskai hinted that he regarded Gabriel as his successor, ordering B\u00e1lint Drugeth (commander-in-chief of his army in Upper Hungary) to \"hold Gabriel B\u00e1thory in the highest esteem among the Hungarian lords\" if he did not return from his meeting with Ottoman Grand Vizier Lala Mehmed Pasha in November 1605. Young noblemen (including Gabriel's future enemy, Gabriel Bethlen) and military officials also supported Gabriel. Years later, G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Bojti Veres wrote that Gabriel hosted feasts to win popularity with Bocskai's courtiers and commanders. Gabriel's relatives, Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1thay (Bocskai's chancellor) and J\u00e1nos Imreffy (Kata Iffj\u00fa's husband), were his principal supporters. His position weakened after Bocskai who was taken ill suddenly had K\u00e1thay imprisoned for treason in early September 1606. K\u00e1thay's opponents, Simon P\u00e9chi and J\u00e1nos Rimay, persuaded the dying (and often unconscious) Bocskai to name B\u00e1lint Drugeth his successor in his last will. The B\u00e1thorys' fortress at Nagyecsed in 1688 Bocskai died in Kassa on 29 December 1606. A mob accused K\u00e1thay of poisoning Bocskai, and lynched him on 12 January 1607. Gabriel had demanded the Principality of Transylvania in a 2 January 1607 letter to the grand vizier, Kuyucu Murad Pasha . Bocskai's deputy, the elderly Sigismund R\u00e1k\u00f3czi , continued to administer the principality with the consent of the Diet of Transylvania . Gabriel sent Bethlen to Sz\u00e9kely captain J\u00e1nos Petki to secure his support, but Bethlen was imprisoned at R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's order on 26 January. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi also dismissed V\u00e1rad captain D\u00e9nes B\u00e1nffy, the fianc\u00e9 of Gabriel's sister Anna. The delegates of the Three Nations of Transylvania wanted to demonstrate their right to freely elect the prince. The Diet first passed a decree prohibiting a minor from being elected prince, preventing Gabriel's election. It ignored Bocskai's last will, electing R\u00e1k\u00f3czi prince on 12 February. Gabriel mustered troops, saying that he only wanted to protect Transylvania. He demanded the cancellation of the Transylvanian decrees ordering the confiscation of his father and uncles' estates in 1595. Gabriel approached Rudolph I's councillors after the Diet expelled the Jesuits from Transylvania, offering to defend the Catholic Church in the principality if he ascended the throne and saying that he was ready to reconvert to Catholicism. Rudolph made him governor of Transylvania in June, but the appointment had no real effect on Gabriel's position. Gabriel married Bocskai's kinswoman, Anna Horv\u00e1th Palocsai, about two months later. After being unpaid for months, the Hajd\u00fas rose up in the autumn of 1607. They offered their support to Drugeth, who refused to lead them. Gabriel also treated them with disdain and promised to protect Transylvania against them at the end of October. He soon mustered his troops and marched to Upper Hungary. He again approached the royal court, asking Rudolph to make him voivode of Transylvania . After the representatives of the Hajd\u00fas and the noblemen of Upper Hungary made a fifty-day truce in In\u00e1ncs at the end of the year, Gabriel began negotiations with the Hajd\u00fas. They concluded a treaty on 8 February 1608. Gabriel pledged to grant villages to the Hajd\u00fas in Partium, and they promised to support him in seizing Transylvania. He also promised to expel \"heretics and idolaters\" (Unitarians and Catholics) from the royal council. According to the contemporary Ferenc Nagy Szab\u00f3's memoirs, the Ottoman grand vizier soon decided to support Gabriel. Gabriel sent Imreffy to R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, offering to help R\u00e1k\u00f3czi seize two important domains in Upper Hungary if R\u00e1k\u00f3czi abdicated. He informed Rudolph's commissioner, Zsigmond Forg\u00e1ch , on 13 February 1608 that R\u00e1k\u00f3czi had already agreed to leave Transylvania. Although the Hajd\u00fas took control of the northwestern region of Partium, Gabriel forbade them to invade Transylvania proper. J\u00e1nos Petki announced R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's abdication at the Diet in Kolozsv\u00e1r (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) on 5 March of that year. Reign Consolidation Michael Weiss , mayor of Brass\u00f3 (now Bra\u0219ov in Romania) The Diet elected Gabriel prince on 7 March 1608, and sent delegates to him in Nagyecsed. Although his election was technically free, he controlled the strongest army in the principality (making resistance impossible). He pledged to respect the laws of the principality, especially the privileges of the Three Nations, before accepting his election on 14\u00a0March. Gabriel was ceremoniously installed in Kolozsv\u00e1r on 31 March, and the Diet granted him the domains of Fogaras (now F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 in Romania) and K\u0151v\u00e1r as hereditary estates. He began settling the Hajd\u00fas in Partium, and granted B\u00f6sz\u00f6rm\u00e9ny to those forced to leave Nagyk\u00e1ll\u00f3 ; others received parcels in Bihar County . About 30,000 Hajd\u00fa soldiers received parcels of land from Gabriel during his reign. To assert his suzerainty over Wallachia and Moldavia , he decided to dethrone Prince Radu \u0218erban of Wallachia; however, the royal council and Michael Weiss (mayor of the important Transylvanian Saxon town of Brass\u00f3, now Bra\u0219ov in Romania) dissuaded him. Radu \u0218erban voluntarily swore fealty to Gabriel in the presence of his envoys on 31 May. On 18 July, thirteen-year-old Prince of Moldavia Constantin I Movil\u0103 also acknowledged Gabriel's suzerainty and promised to pay a yearly tribute of 8,000 florins. That month, Gabriel visited Brass\u00f3. His feasts infuriated the burghers, who called him a drunkard or a greedy new Sardanapalus in defamatory poems. Gabriel's promiscuity was notorious; he reportedly seduced young women and promoted noblemen who were willing to offer him their wives. He sent Bethlen to Istanbul and Imreffy to Kassa to secure his recognition by the Sublime Porte and the royal court. After a brief negotiation, Imreffy and representatives of Rudolph's brother Matthias (who had persuaded Rudolph to abdicate in his favor) signed two treaties on 20 August. The first treaty summarized the privileges of the Hajd\u00fas in Royal Hungary and the Principality of Transylvania. The second recognized Gabriel as lawful ruler of Transylvania, but forbade him to secede from the Holy Crown of Hungary . Bethlen returned from Istanbul in late November with the sultan's delegates, who brought the ahidn\u00e2me confirming Gabriel's election. The sultan exempted Transylvania from paying the customary tribute for three years. Romanian Orthodox priests approached Gabriel for support against noblemen who treated them like serfs. At their request, he freed them from taxation and service demands by the landowners in June 1609. Gabriel also granted them the right to freely move about the principality. At his initiative, in October the Diet abolished all grants which had exempted some noble estates from taxation. Assassination attempt While Gabriel was sleeping at Istv\u00e1n Kendi 's home in Sz\u00e9k (now Sic in Romania) during the night of 10\u201311 March 1610, a man entered his bedroom. Although the intruder had wanted to stab Gabriel, he changed his mind and confessed that Kendi and other (mostly-Catholic) noblemen had hired him. Kendi soon fled to Royal Hungary, but his accomplices were captured. The Diet sentenced the conspirators to death on 24 March, and their estates were confiscated. Gabriel made Imreffy chancellor and Bethlen captain of the Sz\u00e9kelys. The motivation for the conspiracy is unclear. According to the contemporary Tam\u00e1s Borsos , the conspirators wanted to murder Gabriel because his undisciplined Hajd\u00fa troops had destroyed many villages. Calvinist pastor M\u00e1t\u00e9 Szepsi Laczk\u00f3 said that the Catholic noblemen wanted to get rid of the Protestant prince. Others claimed that Boldizs\u00e1r Kornis (captain of the Sz\u00e9kelys) joined the plot because Gabriel had tried to seduce his young wife. Gabriel met Palatine of Hungary Gy\u00f6rgy Thurz\u00f3 in Kir\u00e1lydar\u00f3c (now Craidorol\u021b in Romania) in June, but they could not reach an agreement. He said during the negotiations that he was a sovereign, but the palatine was merely a \"lord's serf\". After returning to Transylvania, Gabriel planned to reunite Royal Hungary and Transylvania under his rule with Ottoman support. Although he ordered the princes of Moldavia and Wallachia to send reinforcements and the Saxons to pay a tax of 100,000 florins, the prince of Moldavia did not send troops and the Saxons paid only 10,000 florins. Imreffy again went to Royal Hungary to negotiate with Thurz\u00f3 in Kassa. By 15 August, they reached a compromise which resolved most of the contentious issues. However, Matthias II did not ratify the agreement because it stated that Transylvania was not required to provide military assistance to Royal Hungary against the Ottomans. Conflicts Szeben during the 17th century Gabriel went to Szeben (now Sibiu in Romania), the wealthiest Saxon town, on 10 December. Although only 50 soldiers accompanied him into the town, his army was stationed on the outskirts. Gabriel stopped at the gate of the town the following day, pretending that he only wanted to study it; while the gate was open, his army unexpectedly marched in and captured the town without resistance. He said that he wanted to secure his entry into Szeben because the Saxons could refuse monarchs entry into their towns. According to the contemporaneous Diego de Estrada , Gabriel wanted to transfer his capital to Szeben from Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r (now Alba Iulia in Romania), which had been destroyed during the Long Turkish War . The Diet declared Szeben capital of the principality on 17 December, limiting its privileges, authorizing noblemen to acquire real estate and Calvinist priests to preach in the town's Lutheran churches. Gabriel launched a military campaign against Wallachia on 26 December. Radu \u015eerban fled the country, enabling Gabriel to take possession of T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te without resistance. Gabriel styled himself prince of Wallachia in a 26 January 1611 charter. According to Radu Popescu's chronicle, his troops brought pillage, destruction and death to the countryside. Gabriel sent his envoys to Istanbul, asking Ottoman Sultan Ahmed I to confirm his rule in Wallachia. He outlined a plan for the conquest of Poland. He also demanded compensation for the salaries of his Hajd\u00fas from the Ottomans, who began to call him \"Deli Kiral\" (Mad King) because of his actions. The Ottoman governors of Buda and Temesv\u00e1r (now Timi\u0219oara in Romania) invaded the Hajd\u00fa villages in Partium, forcing them to hurry back and defend their homes. Ahmed I granted Wallachia to Radu Mihnea and ordered Gabriel to return to Transylvania in March. Although the sultan's decision outraged Gabriel, he had no choice but to accept it. Radu \u015eerban ousted Radu Mihnea from Wallachia at the head of an army of Cossack and Moldavian mercenaries. The Diet ordered the mobilization of the Transylvanian army, authorizing Gabriel to collect an extraordinary tax in April. However, Michael Weiss (who had regarded Gabriel as a new Nero ) incited the burghers of Brass\u00f3 to rise up against the monarch. Gabriel dispatched Hajd\u00fa captain Andr\u00e1s Nagy to lay siege to Brass\u00f3, but Weiss bribed Nagy to lift the siege. Radu \u015eerban invaded Burzenland (now \u021aara B\u00e2rsei in Romania) unexpectedly, and routed Gabriel's army near Brass\u00f3 on 8 July 1611. Gabriel barely escaped from the battlefield to Szeben. Matthias II considered Gabriel's attack against Wallachia as treachery, because he regarded Transylvania and the two Romanian principalities as realms of the Hungarian Crown. Zsigmond Forg\u00e1ch, commander-in-chief of Upper Hungary, invaded Transylvania in late June. Although Nagy and the Hajd\u00fas under his command supported Forg\u00e1ch, most Protestant noblemen refused to join the invasion. Most Transylvanians regarded the invasion as an unlawful action, and only the Saxons were willing to support Forg\u00e1ch. He and Radu \u015eerban besieged Szeben, but could not capture it. Gabriel sent envoys to Istanbul, seeking assistance from the Sublime Porte. Nagy and his Hajd\u00fa troops deserted Forg\u00e1ch and routed the reinforcements sent to him from Upper Hungary in mid-September. After learning of the arrival of Ottoman troops to support Gabriel, Radu \u015eerban withdrew from Szeben; this forced Forg\u00e1ch to lift the siege. The Transylvanian army routed the retreating royal troops, capturing hundreds of soldiers. Gabriel led his army from Szeben to V\u00e1rad, but the Ottoman troops did not accompany him. Delegates of the counties and towns of Upper Hungary persuaded Thurz\u00f3 to begin negotiations with Gabriel, and their envoys signed an agreement in Tokaj in December. Gabriel pledged to send delegates to the Diet of Hungary and not allow serfs to join the Hajd\u00fas. However, the princes of the Holy Roman Empire persuaded Matthias II not to ratify the treaty until Gabriel reached an agreement with the Saxons. Meanwhile, Gabriel sent Hajd\u00fa captain Andr\u00e1s G\u00e9czi to Istanbul to express his gratitude for Ottoman support. G\u00e9czi made an agreement with Michael Weiss in Brass\u00f3, however, and asked for Gabriel's removal on behalf of the Three Nations of Transylvania in Istanbul in November. The Imperial Council of the Ottoman Empire accepted the proposal, and decided to replace Gabriel with G\u00e9czi. After the burghers of Brass\u00f3 refused to surrender, Gabriel invaded Burzenland and captured seven Saxon fortresses in late March and early April 1612. The Diet of Transylvania urged the Saxons of Brass\u00f3 to surrender in May, but the Three Nations delegates did not punish the noblemen who had fled to the town. Gabriel proposed a month later at the Diet that the principality should renounce the sultan's suzerainty, but his proposal was refused. G\u00e9czi sent letters to Andr\u00e1s Nagy (who promised to murder Gabriel), but Nagy's letter was captured. Gabriel killed Nagy or had him executed in August, according to various sources. Gabriel Bethlen (the leading figure of the pro-Ottoman policy) fled to Ottoman territory on 12 September, and visited the Ottoman governors of Temesv\u00e1r, Buda and Kanizsa . With their help, he contacted the grand vizier Nasuh Pasha . Weiss, who wanted to install G\u00e9czi as prince in Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, left Brass\u00f3 at the head of an undisciplined army on 8 October 1612. Gabriel attacked Weiss and his troops, annihilating them six days later. Weiss was beheaded on the battlefield, and G\u00e9czi withdrew to Brass\u00f3. The Diet sentenced the absent G\u00e9czi and Bethlen to death, granting amnesty to those who had surrendered. Fall V\u00e1rad (now Oradea in Romania) in 1617 The Diet authorized Gabriel to begin negotiations with Matthias II, and their envoys signed an alliance in Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) on 24 December 1612. Matthias sent his delegates to Transylvania to urge the Saxons to surrender to Gabriel. The treaty outraged Ahmed I, who decided to replace Gabriel with Bethlen in March. Matthias and Gabriel's envoys concluded a new treaty on 12 April, and Matthias acknowledged Gabriel's hereditary right to rule Transylvania. In a secret agreement, Gabriel promised to support Matthias even against the Ottomans. He granted a royal pardon to the Saxons and their allies, including G\u00e9czi (who was made commander of Gabriel's guard). Gabriel Bethlen left Istanbul in August, accompanied by Skender, the Pasha of Kanizsa. Radu Mihnea invaded Transylvania from Wallachia in early September. Canibek Giray , Khan of the Crimean Tatars , invaded the principality three weeks later. By early October, Ottoman troops arrived to support Bethlen. Gabriel fled from Transylvania proper and withdrew to V\u00e1rad to seek assistance from Royal Hungary against Bethlen and his allies. Zsigmond Forg\u00e1ch sent an army of 2,000 troops, commanded by Mikl\u00f3s Abafy, to V\u00e1rad. Skender Pasha convoked the delegates of the Three Nations to a Diet at Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. The Diet dethroned Gabriel on 21 October, urging him in a letter of farewell to accept the decision, and elected Bethlen prince two days later. According to the contemporaneous historian M\u00e1t\u00e9 Szepsi Lack\u00f3, Andr\u00e1s G\u00e9czi and Mikl\u00f3s Abaffy soon hatched a plot to murder Gabriel in V\u00e1rad. They entered his room on 26 October 1613 and persuaded him to give them his sword, but did not attack the strong prince because he still had a dagger. The following day, Abaffy told Gabriel that the troops from Royal Hungary wanted to see him. After visiting Abaffy's army, Gabriel returned to V\u00e1rad in a carriage. Horsemen suddenly attacked the carriage, forcing it to turn into a narrow street. Gabriel jumped out of the carriage, but was soon shot. He tried to resist at a willow tree near the Pece Stream , but dozens of Hajd\u00fas attacked and killed him. Hajd\u00fa infantry captain Bal\u00e1zs Nagy brought Gabriel's body first to Nagyecsed, and then to Ny\u00edrb\u00e1tor . His body lay unburied in the crypt of the church in Ny\u00edrb\u00e1tor, and he was ceremoniously buried at Bethlen's order only in 1628. Transylvania went through a chaotic period during Gabriel's rule. Historian Katalin P\u00e9ter states that Gabriel \"was not the man to tolerate inaction for long\" and \"ruled with extravagance and capricious irresponsibility\". Gabriel, according to P\u00e9ter, was unable to keep a balance among the different groups of the Transylvanian nobility, which gave rise to new tensions between Calvinists and Catholics, natives and newcomers, pro-Habsburg and pro-Ottoman politicians. Neither could he realize that the Ottoman Empire had recovered after the Long Turkish War by the time he ascended the throne and his expansionist ambitions were not tolerated by the Sultan. Historian L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nagy's evaluation of B\u00e1thory's rule is different. He says that B\u00e1thory's bad fame can be traced back to the works of historians who worked in the court of Gabriel Bethlen who made conscious efforts to denigrate his predecessor. Nagy also emphasizes that 17th-century popular literary works show that many commoners was mourning B\u00e1thory's death. The 20th-century Hungarian novelist Zsigmond M\u00f3ricz characterizes Gabriel B\u00e1thory as a \"true fairy prince\", adding that \"fairies are unfit for this world\". Family Gabriel's wife, Anna, was the daughter of Gy\u00f6rgy Horv\u00e1th Palocsai and Krisztina Sulyok. According to Nagy Szab\u00f3, she was \"a big fat woman\" and Gabriel \"did possibly not love her too much\". Michael Weiss said that Gabriel's separation from his wife was a reason for the Saxons' rebellion because it contradicted divine law. Bethlen accused Gabriel of an incestuous affair with his sister, Anna, first mentioning the rumour in Istanbul in 1613 in an attempt to depose him. The accusation was repeated during a secret lawsuit against Anna, whom Bethlen accused of witchcraft in 1614.

{"id": "doc_fixed_042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Horowitz", "text": "Noah Horowitz (born 1979) is an American art historian and the CEO of Art Basel since 2022. Horowitz was previously at Sotheby\u2019s as Worldwide Head of Gallery & Private Dealer Services, and held the post of Director Americas at Art Basel from 2015 to 2021. He has a Ph.D. in art history from the Courtauld Institute of Art in London and is the author of Art of the Deal: Contemporary Art in a Global Financial Market, published by Princeton University Press in 2011 and released as a paperback in 2014. Career Horowitz was born in Princeton, New Jersey in 1979. He graduated from The Lawrenceville School in 1998 and in 2002 received a B.A. degree in Art History with Economics from the University of Virginia , where he was an Echols Scholar. He continued on at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London for his M.A. (2003) and Ph.D. degrees (2006). While finishing the doctorate, Horowitz worked as an associate at the Serpentine Gallery in London where he was mentored by its co-director Hans Ulrich Obrist . He moved to New York in 2010 and joined the team behind the first online-only art fair, VIP. The following year, he was hired as the Managing Director of The Armory Show in New York and became its overall head in 2012. Horowitz is widely credited with revitalizing the art fair, which had been losing gallery participation in the years leading up to his hire. In July 2015, Art Basel , led by Marc Spiegler , announced they had hired Horowitz as its Director Americas, putting him in charge of Art Basel\u2019s annual December edition in Miami Beach. \u00a0Horowitz oversaw the transformation of the Miami fair and firmly established Art Basel\u2019s presence in the United States and New York more broadly. His initiatives included the launch of the Global Art Market report, written by the economist Clare McAndrew. In 2021, Horowitz moved to Sotheby\u2019s , taking on the newly created position of Worldwide Head of Gallery & Private Dealer Services. During his tenure, Horowitz founded Artist\u2019s Choice, a new sale that enables artists to consign work directly to auction. Horowitz returned to Art Basel as CEO in November 2022, succeeding Global Director Marc Spiegler . Other roles Horowitz has written and lectured widely on art and economics. His texts and commentary have appeared in publications including The New York Times , Financial Times , Texte zur Kunst and The Art Newspaper . His book, Art of the Deal: Contemporary Art in a Global Financial Market, was published by Princeton University Press in 2011 and released as a paperback in 2014. Personal life Horowitz lives in Brooklyn, New York. He is married to fellow art historian Louise Sorensen and together they have two kids.

Biden's father had once led an affluent life, but suffered financial setbacks soon after Biden was born, and for several years the family lived with Biden's maternal grandparents. Beginning in 1953, the family lived in an apartment in Claymont, Delaware , before moving to a house in Mayfield, Delaware . Biden's father later became a successful used-car salesman, maintaining the family in a middle-class lifestyle. At Archmere Academy , the later 46th president Joe Biden himself was class president of his junior and senior high school classes, and graduated from Archmere in 1961. At the University of Delaware , Biden earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965 with a double major in history and political science . In 1966, Biden married Neilia Hunter , a student at Syracuse University . They had three children: Beau , Robert Hunter , and Naomi Christina \"Amy\". In 1968, Biden earned a Juris Doctor degree from the university's College of Law , ranked 76th in his class of 85 students. He was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969 and practiced as a lawyer before running for political office. On December 18, 1972, Biden's wife and daughter died in a car crash. He came close to resigning from the U.S. Senate , to which he had recently been elected for the first time that year. Nearly five years later, Biden married Jill Jacobs \u2014they have one daughter together, Ashley . Early life and education Heritage and childhood See also: Family of Joe Biden Sign at the childhood home of Joe Biden in Scranton Biden was born on November 20, 1942, at St. Mary's Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania , to Catherine Eugenia \"Jean\" Biden n\u00e9e Finnegan (1917-2010) and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr (1915-2002). He was the first of four siblings in a Catholic family, with a sister, Valerie (1945), and two brothers, James (1949) and Francis (1953), following. Biden's mother was of Irish descent, with roots variously attributed to County Louth or County Londonderry , while his father had English , French , and Irish ancestry. His maternal great-grandfather, Edward Francis Blewitt , was a Pennsylvania state senator . His maternal grandfather was a graduate of Santa Clara University in California, where he was \"an acclaimed quarterback\" before returning to Scranton to work for local oil and gas companies, then as a newspaper librarian for the remainder of his career. Biden's father led an affluent lifestyle as a young adult, \"sailing yachts off the New England coast, riding to the hounds, driving fast cars, flying airplanes\" while working as an executive for, and experiencing the largess of, the Sheen Company. The Sheen Company was founded and owned by Bill Sheen, Biden's paternal great-uncle. Bill Sheen had invented a material that he then manufactured as lining for cemetery vaults. He subsequently secured a number of US government contracts to make water-tight sealant for merchant marine ships during World War II and renamed the family business to Sheen Armor Company. Early in Biden's life, the family relocated to a \"four-bedroom Dutch colonial in a Boston suburb, with plenty of money and perks to fly back to Scranton to visit the Finnegans whenever they wanted\" so that Joe Sr. could run Sheen Company's branch office in Boston; Biden's sister, Valerie was born there in 1945. Joe Sr. and his cousin, Bill Sheen Jr., were close friends. After the war was over, the business failed, and several attempts by Biden Sr. and Sheen Jr. to start a business together faltered. Jean Biden took their children back to Scranton in 1948, and Biden Sr. soon followed. For several years, the family had to live with Biden's maternal grandparents, the Finnegans. Biden Jr. attended St. Paul's School, a Catholic primary school in Scranton. He made several lifelong friends in Scranton, who describe \"file drawers full of memories\" of childhood antics and escapades. When the Scranton area fell into economic decline during the 1950s, Biden's father could not find steady work. In 1953, the Biden family moved into an apartment in Claymont, Delaware . The next year, the Bidens relocated to the Village of Arden , an art colony. The year after that, they moved to Mayfield , a neighborhood in Wilmington, Delaware . Joe Biden Sr. became a successful used car salesman , and the family's circumstances were middle class. Biden Jr. attended two more Catholic primary schools: Holy Rosary School in Claymont and then St. Helena's Elementary School in Wilmington. At several times during his youth, Biden considered becoming a priest. High school Biden while a student at Archmere Academy in the 1950s Biden attended the Archmere Academy in Claymont where he was a standout halfback / wide receiver on the high school football team. Scoring ten touchdowns, he helped lead a perennially losing team to an undefeated season in his senior year. His coach, who would be inducted into the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame , subsequently said of Biden, \"He was a skinny kid, but he was one of the best pass receivers I had in 16 years as a coach.\" Biden played as an outfielder on the school's baseball team as well, becoming a starter in his senior year albeit batting in the bottom half of the order . From an early age, Biden had been afflicted by a severe stutter , which often brought teasing from other children and embarrassment with teachers. Excelling in sports was especially important to Biden as it gave him a way of gaining social acceptance despite his speech issue. While not a major participant in the ongoing civil rights movement , he did walk out of a restaurant that refused to serve a football teammate of his who was black. Academically, Biden was a 'B' (above-average) student at Archmere, was considered a natural leader among his classmates, and was elected class president during his junior and senior years. He graduated in 1961. College Biden attended the University of Delaware in Newark , where he was more interested in sports and socializing than in studying, although his classmates were impressed by his cramming abilities. He played halfback with the \"Blue Chicks\" freshman football team (at the time, freshmen were not eligible to play varsity sports). However, when he got a poor 1.9 grade point average for the semester, his parents told him that he had to give up football to concentrate on his classes. He continued to get mostly \"C\" and \"D\" grades for his next two semesters. His grades then began to improve, but never became especially good. He wanted to return to the football field, and by the spring practices of his junior year he thought he was about to earn a starting spot as a defensive back on the varsity for that fall. In 1964, while on spring break in the Bahamas , he met and began dating Neilia Hunter , who was from an affluent background in Skaneateles, New York , and attended Syracuse University . He told her that he aimed to become a senator by the age of 30 and then president. He dropped his plan to play for the varsity football team, enabling him to spend more time visiting out of state with her. He earned his bachelor's in 1965 from the University of Delaware, with a double major in history and political science and a minor in English . He had a \"C\" average overall for his four years, graduating with a class rank of 506 out of 688. Law school Biden in the Syracuse 1968 yearbook Biden then entered the Syracuse University College of Law , chosen in part because it would put him near Neilia Hunter. He received a half scholarship based on financial need with some additional assistance based on academics. By his own description, he found law school to be \"the biggest bore in the world\" and he said he pulled many all-nighters to get by. He relied on the notes of other students for classes that he skipped as well as help from Neilia Hunter in studying. He participated in football and rugby at the collegiate club level and ran for class president, losing by one vote to future financial marketplace executive William J. Brodsky . To date, Brodsky is the only person to ever beat Biden in a head-to-head election. During his first year there, Biden submitted a fifteen-page paper for a legal methods course that was found to have contained academic plagiarism of five pages of a recently published article in the Fordham Law Review . A report from the law school faculty said that Biden should be failed in the course as a result; in response, Biden said the copying was inadvertent due to his not knowing the proper rules of citation. Such mistakes were not uncommon among first-year students still learning the requirements of attribution. Biden was permitted to retake the course after receiving a failing \"F\" grade, which was subsequently dropped from his record. Overall, evaluations from Biden's professors were mixed, but Biden's grades were such that he was consistently near the bottom of his class the entire time he was in the school. One professor later said that Biden had done very well in a legislation course and that \"I had the impression this was a young man who was going to do well and go a long way,\" while another professor later said of Biden, \"He was one of the great successes after law school, but not in law school. It happens all the time.\" Biden received his Juris Doctor in 1968, graduating 76th of 85 in his class. He was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969. Other experiences Negative impressions of drinking alcohol in the Biden and Finnegan families and in the neighborhood led to Biden becoming a teetotaler . Having suffered from stuttering through much of his childhood and into his twenties, he has said that he finally overcame it by spending many hours reciting poetry in front of a mirror. During the early 1960s, Biden participated in a demonstration against the last remaining segregated theater in Wilmington. Some sources have also described Biden participating in a protest while he was still in high school, against the Towne Theatre. During the summer of 1962, while in college, Biden worked as the only white lifeguard at a swimming pool in a black neighborhood of Wilmington, an experience which he later credited with expanding his thinking regarding racial issues. Later in life, Biden repeatedly told a story that, while working at the pool, he confronted a man nicknamed \"Corn Pop\", the leader of a gang called the Romans, persuading the man to walk away from a potential fight by apologizing to him. While considered outlandish or bizarre by some commentators, various lifelong Delawareans and contemporary newspaper articles confirmed the broad outlines of Biden's story, identifying his antagonist as a man named William \"Corn Pop\" Morris. Draft Regarding the U.S. military draft , Biden received five \"2-S\" student deferments during this period, with the first coming in late 1963 and the last in early 1968 at the peak of the Vietnam War . Student deferments such as the ones Biden received were given out routinely during this period. In April 1968, he received a draft notice as he was about to graduate from law school; but after a medical examination he was reclassified by the Selective Service System as \"1-Y\", not available for service except in national emergency, due to having had asthma as a teenager. The notion that Biden suffered from asthma has been questioned by some observers, given his past participation in football and other sports and his having appeared healthy in the time leading up to his examination. Some sources report that Biden's 2007 memoir, Promises to Keep , never mentions asthma; but he does briefly mention having had \"childhood asthma\" in a passage in the book describing his health during and after his 1988 presidential campaign. Young men looking to avoid active-duty military service was common during the Vietnam War. Other figures from the era who would go on to become national leaders also received similar numbers of student deferments or non-obvious medical exemptions. Biden was generally supportive of the war during much of this time, and never took part in anti-war demonstrations , later saying that at the time he was preoccupied with marriage and law school, and \"wore sports coats ... not tie-dyed\". Early political career and family life On August 27, 1966, while Biden was still a law student, he married Neilia Hunter. They overcame her Presbyterian parents' initial reluctance for her to wed a Roman Catholic, and the ceremony was held in a Catholic church in Skaneateles . The couple had three children, Joseph R. \"Beau\" Biden III in 1969, Robert Hunter in 1970, and Naomi Christina in 1971. During 1968, Biden clerked for six months at a law firm headed by prominent local Republican William Prickett and, as he later said, \"thought of myself as a Republican\". He disliked the conservative racial politics of incumbent Democratic Governor of Delaware Charles L. Terry and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson , who defeated Terry in 1968. The local Republicans tried to recruit him, but he resisted due to his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon , and registered as an Independent instead. In 1969, Biden resumed practicing law, first as a public defender in Wilmington, Delaware . Most of his clients were African Americans from Wilmington's east side. Biden's time as a public defender was short, but several of his cases attracted newspaper coverage, including his defenses of a fisherman accused of stealing a cow (sentenced to no jail time), and a 15-year-old charged with drug possession (acquitted). Biden later described the job in his memoir as \"God's work\", but also wrote that \"God's work wasn't full time work in 1969\". Biden then joined a firm headed by Sid Balick, a locally active Democrat. Balick named him to the Democratic Forum, a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party, and Biden switched his registration to Democratic. He also started his own firm, Biden and Walsh. Corporate law , however, did not appeal to him and criminal law did not pay well. He supplemented his income by managing properties. Later in 1969, Biden ran as a Democrat for the New Castle County Council on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburban area. He won by a solid, two-thousand vote margin in the usually Republican district and in a bad year for Democrats in the state. Even before taking his seat, he was already talking about running for the U.S. Senate in a couple of years. He served on the County Council from 1970 to 1972 while continuing his private law practice. Biden represented the 4th district on the county council. Among issues he addressed on the council was his opposition to large highway projects that might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods, including those related to Interstate 95 . 1972 U.S. Senate campaign Biden's entry into the 1972 U.S. Senate election in Delaware presented a unique circumstance. Longtime Delaware political figure and Republican incumbent Senator J. Caleb Boggs was considering retirement, which would likely have left U.S. Representative Pete du Pont and Wilmington Mayor Harry G. Haskell Jr. in a divisive primary fight. To avoid that, U.S. president Richard Nixon helped convince Boggs to run again with full party support. No other Democrat wanted to run against Boggs. Biden's campaign had virtually no money and was given no chance of winning. It was managed by his sister Valerie Biden Owens (who would go on to manage his future campaigns) and staffed by other family members, and relied upon handed-out newsprint position papers and meeting voters face-to-face; the small size of the state and lack of a major media market made the approach feasible. He did receive some assistance from the AFL\u2013CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell . His campaign issues focused on withdrawal from Vietnam, the environment, civil rights, mass transit, more equitable taxation, health care, the public's dissatisfaction with politics-as-usual, and \"change\". During the summer, he trailed by almost 30\u00a0percentage points, but his energy level, his attractive young family, and his ability to connect with voters' emotions gave the surging Biden an advantage over the ready-to-retire Boggs. He won the November 7, 1972 election in an upset by a margin of 3,162 votes. Death of wife and daughter On December 18, 1972, a few weeks after the election, Biden's wife and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident while Christmas shopping in Hockessin, Delaware . Neilia Biden's station wagon was hit by a tractor-trailer truck as she pulled out from an intersection, possibly because her head was turned and she did not see the other vehicle; the truck swerved and overturned in an attempt to avoid the collision. Within a couple of days of the accident, a Delaware chief deputy attorney general, Jerome O. Herlihy, announced that the truck driver had been cleared of any wrongdoing in it. Biden's sons Beau and Hunter survived the accident and were taken to the hospital in fair condition, Beau with a broken leg and other wounds, and Hunter with a minor skull fracture and other head injuries. Doctors soon said both would make full recoveries. Biden considered resigning to care for them, saying that the people of Delaware \"can always get another senator\" but that his children \"can't get another father,\" but was persuaded not to by Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield . In later years, Biden said on several occasions that the truck driver had been drinking alcohol before the collision, and several media outlets reported this as fact. The driver died in 1999, but his daughter sought to have his name again cleared and to get an apology from Biden. By this time, the police records regarding the accident had been lost, but the accident investigator Herlihy, who had become a Delaware Superior Court judge, reiterated that \"The rumor about alcohol being involved by either party, especially the truck driver, is incorrect.\" Subsequently, a Biden spokesperson said that Biden \"fully accepts the [driver's] family's word that these rumors were false.\" Biden called the driver's daughter to apologize personally, which she accepted. Senate and recovery See also: United States Senate career of Joe Biden Entering the Senate Biden was sworn into office on January 5, 1973, by Francis R. Valeo , the secretary of the Senate , in a small chapel at the Delaware Division of the Wilmington Medical Center . Beau was wheeled in with his leg still in traction; Hunter, who had already been released, was also there, as were other members of the extended family. Witnesses and television cameras were also present and the event received national attention. At age 30 (the minimum age required to hold the office), Biden became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history, and one of only 18 senators who took office before reaching the age of 31. But the accident had left him filled with both anger and religious doubt: \"I liked to [walk around seedy neighborhoods] at night when I thought there was a better chance of finding a fight ... I had not known I was capable of such rage ... I felt God had played a horrible trick on me.\" To be at home every day for his young sons, Biden began the practice of commuting every day by Amtrak train for 90 minutes each way from his home in the Wilmington suburbs to Washington, D.C., which he continued to do throughout his Senate career. In the aftermath of the accident, he had trouble focusing on work and appeared to just go through the motions of being a senator. In his memoirs, Biden notes that staffers were taking bets on how long he would last. A single father for five years, he left standing orders that he be interrupted in the Senate at any time if his sons called. In remembrance of his wife and daughter, Biden does not work on December 18, the anniversary of the accident. Nonetheless, during these first years in the Senate, Biden focused on consumer protection and environmental issues and called for greater government accountability. He supported legislation dedicated to campaign finance reform , reflecting that during his senate election, offers of campaign funds in implicit return for future favors had been tempting in light of his lack of personal wealth. In mid-1974, Time magazine named Biden as one of the 200 Faces for the Future in a profile that mentioned what had happened to his family, calling him \"self-confident\" and \"compulsively ambitious\". Recovery and second marriage Biden and his second wife, Jill , met in 1975 and married in 1977. By 1974, Biden had begun dating again, while avoiding marriage in the belief it would be unfair to his partner\u2014he described himself to a reporter as \"still in love with his wife\". However, in 1975, Biden met Jill Tracy Jacobs , who had grown up in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania , and become a teacher in Delaware. They met on a blind date arranged by Biden's brother, although it turned out that Biden had already noticed a photograph of her in an advertisement for a local park in Wilmington, Delaware . Biden would credit her with renewing his interest in both politics and life. He proposed marriage to her several times before she accepted; she was wary of entering the public spotlight, anxious to remain focused on her own career, and initially hesitant to take on the commitment of raising his two young sons who had survived the accident. On June 17, 1977, Biden and Jacobs were married by a Catholic priest at the Chapel at the United Nations in New York City. They spent their honeymoon at Lake Balaton in the Hungarian People's Republic , behind the Iron Curtain ; the destination was chosen upon the recommendation of Hungarian-born Biden staffer Tom Lantos . Joe and Jill Biden have one daughter together, Ashley Blazer (born 1981), and regularly attend Mass at St. Joseph's on the Brandywine in Greenville, Delaware . References Footnotes ^ Biden has been defeated in some presidential primary and caucus contests. ^ This incident would attract attention in 1987 when further plagiarism accusations emerged during his 1988 presidential campaign; some exaggerations and inaccurate statements that Biden had made regarding his college and law school accomplishments also became an issue, causing Biden to release transcripts and other documents from both schools.

{"id": "doc_fixed_052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_H._West", "text": "For others of the same name, see Francis West (disambiguation) . Francis Henry West (October 25, 1825\u00a0\u2013 March 6, 1896) was an American businessman, politician, and Wisconsin pioneer. He was a member of the Wisconsin Legislature for three years, and served as a Union Army officer during the American Civil War , earning an honorary brevet to brigadier general. Early life and career West was born in Charlestown, New Hampshire . He moved to the Wisconsin Territory in 1845, eventually settling in Monroe , in Green County , in 1846. In Green County, he worked in the lumber industry. In 1853, he was elected as a Democrat to represent Green County in the Wisconsin State Senate for the 1854 and 1855 sessions. In 1855, he was the Republican nominee for Bank Comptroller, but was not successful. In 1859 and 1860, he accompanied parties of migrants from New York to California. Civil War West joined the Army on August 28, 1862, and was commissioned a lieutenant colonel with the 31st Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment , which was still being organized in Wisconsin. The 31st Wisconsin was created from two volunteer battalions from Crawford County and Racine . The 31st mustered into service in October 1862 and left Wisconsin in March 1863. Kentucky and Tennessee The 31st traveled to Kentucky via Cairo, Illinois , and was attached to the XVI Army Corps . They spent the summer of 1863 on patrols and picket duty in southern Illinois, western Kentucky, protecting supply routes along the Mississippi River . In September 1863, they were ordered to Nashville . Here, their colonel, Isaac E. Messmore , resigned, and, on October 8, Lt. Colonel West was promoted to colonel of the 31st Wisconsin. Through the winter of 1863\u201364, the regiment was stationed at Murfreesboro, Tennessee , and continued to serve as protection for logistics and supplies. In April 1864, the 31st was attached to the XX Corps and split into detachments to protect a long stretch of railroad lines in Tennessee. In June, the regiment was ordered to consolidate and return to Nashville. Georgia On July 5, the 31st Wisconsin was ordered by General William Tecumseh Sherman to proceed to the front of the ongoing Atlanta campaign . The 31st traveled by train to Marietta, Georgia , and reached its position on the line July 21. The regiment worked on constructing siege fortifications around Atlanta and came under frequent enemy fire due to their proximity to the enemy lines. The regiment did not take part in the actual battle, but was one of the first units to enter the city. The regiment was assigned to provide security in the city and protect foraging operations in the surrounding area. On November 15, 1864, the XX Corps broke camp and marched out of the city to begin their part in Sherman's March to the Sea (the Savannah Campaign). They advanced without encountering any resistance until ten miles outside Savannah . There, on December 9, they encountered two small enemy fortifications. The 31st Wisconsin, along with the 61st Ohio , were ordered to flank the position through a thick swamp. They passed the swamp and charged the enemy, taking the position with light casualties. For their action, they received the compliments of General Sherman. The regiment joined the siege of Savannah, and after capturing the city were assigned quarters there. Carolinas On January 18, 1865, the 31st Wisconsin departed Savannah and marched for Purrysburg, South Carolina , at the start of the Carolinas campaign . The regiment proceeded through South Carolina, burning enemy facilities, tearing up railroad tracks, and pushing the enemy's rear guard toward North Carolina. On March 1, the 31st advanced toward Chesterfield, South Carolina , near the border with North Carolina. They forced a small confederate force to flee north, then stopped in the village. On March 16, the 31st took position on the front line for Averasborough , where they were shelled and took casualties. Three days later, they were in the advance on approach to Bentonville , along with two other regiments, where they encountered significant Confederate opposition and found their flanks exposed. They fell back and formed a defensive position with elements of the XIV and XX Corps. The Confederates attacked their position five times and were repelled in fierce fighting. This was the worst fighting that they saw during the war, and suffered ten killed and forty-two wounded. On March 24, they reached Goldsboro, North Carolina , where they stopped to rest and re-equip. While the 31st was camped at Goldsboro, Ulysses S. Grant accepted the surrender of Robert E. Lee at Appomatox . On April 10, the 31st marched out to continue their advance toward Raleigh , pursuing Joseph E. Johnston and the remnants of the Army of the South . But before they reached Raleigh, they received word that Johnston had surrendered to Sherman and the war was effectively over. The 31st was ordered back to Washington, where they participated in the Grand Review of the Armies in May, and West mustered out on June 20, 1865. While in Washington, U.S. President Andrew Johnson nominated Colonel West for an honorary brevet to brigadier general of volunteers for gallant service in the field, effective back to March 19, 1865, the day of their combat at Bentonville. The United States Senate confirmed the brevet on March 12, 1866. Postbellum years After the war, General West moved to Milwaukee County and entered a partnership\u2014Fowler & West\u2014with James S. Fowler in the grain commission business. He served for six years on the board of directors of the Milwaukee Chamber of Commerce, including two years as president. In 1873, he was elected on the Reform ticket to represent Northern Milwaukee County in the Wisconsin State Assembly for the 1874 session. The Reform Party was a short-lived coalition of Democrats, reformers, Liberal Republicans , and Grangers . Their signature accomplishment was the 1874 \" Potter Law ,\" 1874 Wisconsin Act 273 \u2014named for Republican state senator Robert L. D. Potter \u2014which established a new state Railroad Commission to aggressively regulate railroad and freight fees. In the Assembly, Colonel West served on the Committee on Railroads and the Committee on State Affairs. General West did not seek re-election in 1874. During Grover Cleveland 's first presidential term, West was appointed United States Marshal for the Milwaukee district. After completing this final public service, Colonel West retired to Alabama, where two of his sons lived. While on a trip to New York, in 1896, West slipped while attempting to step off of a street car and was severely injured. He was confined to his bed for several days before he was healthy enough to return to Alabama. He died a few weeks later, on March 6, 1896, at Bessemer, Alabama . He was buried at Forest Home Cemetery , in Milwaukee. Personal life and family Francis H. West was the second of four children born to Enoch Hammond West and his wife Lydia ( n\u00e9e Fitch). Both of Francis's brothers, Frederick and Charles, also came to Green County, Wisconsin, and were active in local politics. The West family were descended from Francis West, a carpenter who came to Massachusetts Bay Colony from England in the 1630s. Francis West married Emma Moore Rittenhouse in June 1849. They had at least eight children together, though at least one died young. His former home at Monroe, Wisconsin, now known as the General Francis H. West House , is listed on the National Register of Historic Places .

The A1 motorway crosses the territory of the settlement north of the village. The area is part of the traditional region of Styria . The municipality is now included in the Savinja Statistical Region . Name Arja Vas was attested in written sources in 1368 as Bernstorf (and as Wernstorf in 1428, Bernsdorff in 1441, and Wernsdorff in 1454). The name in modern German was Arndorf , and in the local dialect the settlement is known as Vrja ves . Based on the local name and the medieval transcriptions, the name is based on an adjective form of the personal name *Var or *Varo , thus originally meaning 'Var(o)'s village'. The initial Slovene V- and German W- was lost because it was reanalyzed as the Slovene preposition v 'in'. Shrine The village chapel-shrine dates to the early 20th century and was renovated in 2008.

{"id": "doc_fixed_064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft_Legends", "text": "Minecraft Legends is a 2023 real-time action - strategy video game developed by Mojang Studios and Blackbird Interactive and published by Xbox Game Studios . A spin-off of the 2011 sandbox game Minecraft , it was released on Windows , Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , and Xbox Series X/S on April 18, 2023. The game would later cease development on January 10, 2024. The goal of the game is to defend the Overworld from an invasion of piglins, pig-like humanoid creatures from the Nether dimension, while the player gradually strengthens their structures and troops with resources harvested. The game received mixed reviews from critics, with its gameplay being both praised for its execution and criticized for its repetitive nature. Gameplay Minecraft Legends is set in the Minecraft Overworld, an earth-like dimension filled with various biomes and natural resources that is currently under attack from the piglin hordes from the Nether dimension. The Overworld contains friendly villages, hostile piglin outposts, and the Well of Fate (the player spawnpoint and fast-travel hub). Similarly to Minecraft , the Overworld is procedurally generated, resulting in a unique world for each playthrough of the game. Players collect resources to construct defenses, upgrade buildings, and summon troops. Players collect basic resources such as wood and stone by assigning friendly Allays to harvest them from deposits found in the Overworld. Other resources, such as redstone and lapis lazuli are used to build advanced structures and summon stronger troops but are locked behind Well of Fate upgrades. Prismarine, which is needed to construct some buildings, can only be collected by defeating piglin structures. The player can use resources they've collected to construct buildings and upgrade the Well of Fate. Defensive fortifications such as walls and turrets protect friendly villages and player outposts. Spawners summon friendly troops the players can recruit into their army. Offensive structures such as the redstone cannon, hurl explosive shells at targets from long range. Upgrading the Well of Fate unlocks more advanced buildings and troops. The primary goal of combat is to destroy piglin outposts and defend friendly villages from periodic piglin raids. Players use their summoned troops to assault and destroy piglin outposts. Players travel around the Overworld on their mount, from which they can issue various orders command their army on the battlefield. These commands include orders to rally, halt, and charge. Players can also use their sword to attack enemies directly. Players build their army by constructing spawner buildings that summon troops or recruiting troops from camps found throughout the Overworld. Minecraft Legends incorporates the same Minecoins currency as Minecraft Bedrock Edition . This currency is used to purchase additional skins and mounts within the game. The game is sold with an optional \"Deluxe Skin Pack\", which contains six additional in-game skins: one hero skin and five mount skins. Plot The game begins with the player mining in a cave when they are greeted by three beings: Action, Knowledge, and Foresight. These beings are called Hosts, caretakers of the Overworld. These three persuade the player to help them save their world, where a war has broken out between the Nether and the Overworld. The player is then transported to that world. After completing a tutorial, the player must save a few villages from being invaded by piglins from the Nether. Then, the player destroys three nether outposts that are preparing to invade villages. Subsequently, the player destroys nine Nether portals from three different world areas. In each of these three areas, the player has to defeat a piglin boss: \"the Devourer,\" \"the Beast,\" and \"the Unbreakable\". Once the player destroys all of the portals and defeats all of the bosses, the player fights the final boss: \"the Great Hog.\" Just as the player defeats the Great Hog, it makes a last attempt at destroying the Well of Fate. This backfires and its army is swallowed by a portal that sends them back to the Nether. Then, the Great Hog finally dies. After the battle, there is a grand celebration in the Overworld of their win over the piglins. Not all is well, however. The warrior villagers, who fought alongside the hero, resent the pacifistic villagers who did not, which causes a rift between the two groups. In addition to this, the Hosts have left the world to the Hero's responsibility and moved on. Development Minecraft Legends began development in 2018. The game was announced during the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase on June 12, 2022. After the show, a trailer on the Minecraft YouTube channel confirmed additional platforms. It is developed by series creators Mojang Studios in collaboration with Blackbird Interactive , a team founded by former Relic Entertainment employees, who are best known for developing the real-time strategy video game series Homeworld . After the success of Minecraft Dungeons , another spin-off of Minecraft , Minecraft Legends was released on April 18, 2023. It was made available to play on Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 5 , PlayStation 4 , Steam , Windows 11|10, PC Game Pass, Xbox Game Pass , Xbox Series X/S , Xbox One , and Xbox Cloud Gaming . On January 10, 2024, Mojang announced that no more updates will be released for Minecraft Legends . Reception Reception Reception of the game was generally mixed. According to the review aggregator Metacritic , Minecraft Legends received \"mixed or average\" reviews. Critics viewed the game as a solid addition to the Minecraft franchise but offered differing opinions on its execution. Destructoid writer Timothy Monbleau expressed newfound appreciation for both Minecraft and the strategy genre after playing the game, while Sarah Thwaites of Game Informer described the game as feeling \"caught between the expected complexity of strategy games and the franchise\u2019s approachable brand.\" Critics generally found the gameplay fun but repetitive and lacking in depth. They praised the game for its Minecraft -themed art style, resource gathering mechanics, and base-building gameplay. Critics also liked the multiplayer co-op and PvP modes. Some reviewers criticized the game's lack of strategic depth, poor AI, and tedious gameplay.

Activities Wagensveld has been the leader of Pegida Netherlands since November 2014, at a time when he owned a small internet-based business selling non-lethal weapons, self-defence articles and outdoors products. He had previously that year participated in a Hogesa demonstration. He lives in Germany close to the Dutch border, and commutes to the Netherlands to stage demonstrations, and is a staunch supporter of Geert Wilders . In 2016, he was revealed to have been patrolling for refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey with Tatjana Festerling . In April 2018, Wagensveld was sentenced to two years and nine months in prison for tax evasion . He was investigated by Dutch police for tearing out pages of the Quran and calling it a \"fascist book\" in January 2023 in front of the Dutch parliament building. His desecrations of the Quran contributed to the diplomatic Quran crisis that year. In August, he trampled on and tore up a Quran outside the Turkish embassy in The Hague. During his subsequent trial in November, he tore apart another copy of the Quran. He was sentenced to forty hours of community service. In January 2024, he was violently attacked during a demonstration in Arnhem after he tried to burn a Quran. In March, he was arrested in Arnhem for pulling a Quran on a dog leash.

Born in Kenya to missionary parents, Miller was primarily raised in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania . He ran track, cross country, and played American soccer in high school. He continued to run at Rochester Institute of Technology while studying electrical engineering . After college Miller worked in the print shop on the Queen Mary 2 cruise ship, and trained for running on a treadmill, the ship's stairwells, and at ports of call. After his win of the JFK 50 Mile in 2013 with the third fastest time in course history, he turned pro while continuing his cruise ship work. In 2015, his win of Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc's 105 kilometres (65\u00a0mi) Courmayeur-Champex-Chamonix (CCC) was the first American win of that race. After his cruise work Miller was the resident caretaker at Barr Camp near Manitou Springs, Colorado for five years, which provided the opportunity to live and train at altitude on the Barr Trail and nearby Pikes Peak . After Barr Camp, Miller's primary residence became a converted school bus . After a three-year break to recover from Haglund's syndrome , Miller returned to racing in 2023. He became one of only a few American men to podium at the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc 105 mile race, after coming in second to overall winner Jim Walmsley . Notable race results Miller has won or had a top three finish at a number of the most competitive ultramarathons in the world.

The original venue opened in 1984, and a major redevelopment and expansion was completed in 2023. The centre now has two Olympic size (60\u00a0m \u00d7 30\u00a0m) ice rinks . It is owned by the Lee Valley Regional Park Authority , and is home to the Lee Valley Lions ice hockey team. History The ice centre was opened in 1984 by Torvill and Dean . By the 2010s the centre was aging and unable to cope with demand, and a redevelopment was proposed. There was some opposition from environmental groups due to the impact on Leyton Marsh , but the plans were approved by Waltham Forest council. The \u00a330\u00a0million redevelopment was funded by the Lee Valley Regional Park Authority and the London Borough of Waltham Forest , and added a gym, dance studio and cafe together with the new ice rinks. Robin Cousins , Olympic gold medal winning figure skater and president of British Ice Skating , took part in a \"soft-launch\" event, before the centre opened to the public on Saturday 17 June. Ice hockey The Lee Valley Ice Centre is home to the Lee Valley Lions , an amateur side competing in the English National Ice Hockey League . It used to also be home to the London Racers , who competed in the top-level British Elite Ice Hockey League . The Racers controversially withdrew from the league in 2005 after the club claimed that the rink was not safe enough for \"elite\" level ice hockey, although this was challenged by the park authority. Other clubs playing at the centre include the London Devils, and Eastern Stars IHC. The Lee Valley Vampires entered the Women's National Ice Hockey League in 2024, the first ever league women's club to play at Lee Valley. Additional information The music video for \"Sugar Coated Iceberg\" by The Lightning Seeds , which featured on their 1996 album Dizzy Heights , was filmed inside Lee Valley Ice Centre. Dancing on Ice rehearsals are also occasionally filmed inside Lee Valley Ice Centre. References ^ \"Facilities at Lee Valley Ice Centre\" . Better .

{"id": "doc_fixed_071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Everett-Green", "text": "Evelyn Ward Everett-Green (17 November 1856 in London \u2013 23 April 1932 in Funchal) was an English novelist who started with improving, pious stories for children, moved on to historical fiction for older girls, and then turned to adult romantic fiction. She wrote about 350 books, more than 200 of them under her own name, and others using the pseudonyms H. F. E. , Cecil Adair , E. Ward and Evelyn Dare . Early life and work Evelyn was born at 7 Upper Gower Street, London . Her mother was a historian, Mary Anne Everett Green (n\u00e9e Wood), and her father, George Pycock Green, a portrait and landscape painter. The family were Methodists . She was the second of the family's three surviving daughters and had an older brother. She was baptised at Great Queen Street Wesleyan Methodist Chapel on 22 February 1857 as Eveline, but changed her name to Evelyn in later life. Like the rest of her family, she added Everett to her surname in honour of George Green's friend the Wesleyan historian James Everett . From earliest childhood, Evelyn invented stories to tell her sisters. She was educated at home until the age of 12, then at Gower Street Preparatory School , where she wrote a historical tale about Lady Jane Grey . Next came a year at Bedford College, London on a Reid scholarship (1872\u20131873), during which she wrote Tom's Tempest Victory , her first novel. She continued to write while studying at the London Academy of Music . She also worked as a nurse in a London hospital for two years. Her brother's death in 1876 ended plans to go to India with him. She occupied herself with good works, including Sunday School teaching and nursing, and later hospital nursing. Writing career In 1880 Tom Tempest's Victory became her first published work, under the pseudonym H. F. E. Though it was soon followed by other works, she found writing at home difficult and town winters unhealthy for her. In 1881 she was still living in Gower Street with her family, but in 1883 she moved outside London with Catherine Mainwaring Sladen. In the 1890s and early 1900s they had homes in Albury, Surrey . At the time of the 1891 England Census, however, she and Catherine were currently visiting her family at Gower Street. While in Albury, Everett-Green wrote numerous historical novels and somewhat fewer moral tales for the Religious Tract Society . Her novel about Joan of Arc entitled Called of Her Country (1903), later republished as A Heroine of France , presents Joan as a feminine \"Angelic Maid\" in white armour, whose inspiring adventures were undertaken in a dutiful spirit. Many of her works have been dismissed by critics as apologies for an oppressive order. The girls' historical romance genre is viewed by such critics as a validation of \"traditional\", restrictive, domestic-oriented versions of femininity by showing they had long-established historical precedents. Much of Everett-Green's fiction and non-fiction was meant for girls, but she also wrote boys' adventure stories such as A Gordon Highlander (1901). Many of her books followed values and themes learnt during her Methodist upbringing. These are clearest in her books targeting children in general. She soon turned to novels for slightly older girls, the genre she is best remembered for. They generally followed development in a household from childhood to adulthood. Careers for women were mentioned without disapproval, but the endings invariably featured marriage for the female heroines. Contemporary critics, such as one from the Chicago Daily Tribune, said the works were written with \"obvious good intention\", but the \"day of the weepy, fainting, blue-eyed... heroine has vanished.\" Between 1890 and 1909 she wrote about 50 historical tales before moving to Madeira. Thereafter she wrote romantic novels for adults, often under the pseudonym Cecil Adair . According to a modern critic, \"Family sagas or romances with a historical adventure setting were her speciality.\" Contemporary readers enjoyed these for their chaste sensationalism and they had considerable success. She occasionally collaborated with fellow authors Louisa Bedford and Emma and Beatrice Marshall. Evelyn's works were some of the most popular of her generation. She was one of the bestselling authors with her publisher, Stanley Paul. However, while popular enough to bring in adequate income, they lack real distinction and are now generally read for the light they shed on social backgrounds. Later life and death In the 1911 census, Everett-Green, with several servants, is recorded as still living at Albury with Catherine, as \"joint heads\" of the household. In that year, however, Evelyn and Catherine moved abroad and eventually settled in Quinta Pico de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Madeira . However, during the First World War they both lived at Battramsley near Lymington, Hampshire. She and Catherine remained there, financially independent and unmarried. Dominic James has suggested their partnership may have been a romantic one, in line with the same-sex relationship Everett-Green outlined in Fast friends; or, David and Jonathan (1882), which was published under a pseudonym. Evelyn returned to England each year to visit her sister Gertrude and do business with her publishers. She became an active member of the Anglican community in Madeira and was buried in the British Cemetery. There is a memorial plaque on the interior south wall of the English Holy Trinity Church, Funchal. She left a fortune of \u00a35,657. 9s 3d, with the classical scholar A. S. F. Gow administering her will. Later reception An extract from The Mistress of Lydgate Priory (1885): \"For a time I was afraid of her, with that fear that is not unwholesome in the young and has a fascination of its own. I liked to see her come into my room, and was sorry when she left. I liked to watch her from my window as she paced in her stately way to and fro upon the terrace.... My grandmother was herself a reserved and silent woman; moreover, she was imbued with a sound and practical common sense that I have never seen equalled, and which gave her a power and discernment rarely to be met with. Every one came to her for advice, as it seemed to me; and seldom did they go away without having received just such counsel as they most needed. The confidence she inspired was something marvellous, as was the deep and true veneration with which all regarded her.\" The figure represented in this extract exemplifies the recurring theme of a stern and authoritative matriarch seen in the eyes of an adoring and respectful young woman. This theme has led critics to accuse Everett-Green of apologizing for an oppressive order. Indeed her status as a writer for the juvenile female market has led to her works being lumped together as conservative and reactionary by critics such as Kimberley Reynolds. This reading of them became problematic in the 20th century. The idea of girls' literature enforcing traditional forms of femininity comes from later commentators such as E. J. Salmon. This has led to a perception that all literature of this kind was reactionary and conservative. Hillary Skelding has argued that Everett-Green's historical works maintain a high degree of historical accuracy, due to her mother's background as a historian and other female historians of the era. Some of her narratives focus on the unexceptional, everyday women of history who often acknowledge such domestic authority. She depicts in her fictional mothers and wives greater shrewdness and cleverness than her male counterparts did. Conversely, Kimberley Reynolds has noted that some such characters are powerful only within the domestic sphere and do not change the conventional patriarchal order. In effect, she only offers the illusion of female empowerment by limiting it to the domestic sphere. Selected works The Doctor's Dozen (1880) Fast friends; or, David and Jonathan (1882) (as H. F. E.)

Each flower features five petals , two wings , and a keel that resembles the curled beak of a parrot. If the winter season is too cold, too dry, or too rainy, trees may not blossom. History Historically, palash originated in Bihar and Jharkhand . Dhak forests covered much of the Doaba area between the Ganges and the Yamuna rivers, but these were cleared for agriculture in the early 19th century as the English East India Company increased tax demands on the peasants. Use The plant is used to make timber, resin, fodder, medicine, and dye. The wood is dirty white and soft. Being durable under water, it is used for well curbs and water scoops. Spoons and ladles made of its wood are used in various Hindu rituals to pour ghee into the fire. Good charcoal can be obtained from it. Farmers typically plant trees on field bunds and use them to reduce soil erosion. Young shoots are grazed by buffaloes as fodder. The leaves were once used to serve food where plastic plates would be used today. Consumption of Palash Sharbat (a drink made with the plant) is noted in Ayurvedic traditions to help the body endure heat and may support general health. Some modern studies have highlighted its antioxidant content, but robust clinical evidence is currently limited. Fixed oil in the seed and glucoside butrin of the flower sap are considered to be poisonous. Its consumption may cause dizziness , headache, and hypotension . A young cowherd preparing bankh from Butea roots Lac production In India, the tree serves as a crucial host for the lac bug ( Laccifer lacca ), which creates shellac . It produces the most lac sticks per hectare of any lac tree. Leather production The bark produces a crimson exudate that, when dried, hardens into a substance called \" Butea gum \" or \"Bengal kino\". The gum is considered valuable by druggists because of its astringent qualities and by leather workers because of its tannin . Culinary use The gum from the tree, called kamarkas in Hindi , is used in certain food dishes. In Maharashtra state of India it is prepared as a summer beverage out of tea of the flower which is considered to have medicinal benefits. Patravali plate Main article: Patravali In villages of many parts of India, for example in Maharashtra , this tree provides the leaves that are used either with many pieced together or singly (only in case of a banana leaf) to make a leaf-plate for serving a meal. Up until a century ago, a would-be-son-in-law was tested on his dexterity in making this plate and bowl (used to serve daal, gravy dishes) before being declared acceptable by the father-in-law-to-be. Dye The flowers are used to prepare a traditional Holi colour called \"Kesari\". It is also used as a dye for fabric. Butein , a vibrant yellow to deep orange-red dye made from the flowers, is used mostly for dying silk and occasionally for dying cotton. Hindus ink their foreheads with this colour. Literature The plant is known as pal\u0101\u015ba in Sanskrit and is found in Sanskrit texts including the Rigveda and Yajur Veda. The first sloka of the Sukla Yajurveda speaks about the Palasa tree. The Palasa tree branch is cut and trimmed by the Adhvaryu priest who performed the practical part of sacrifice, the day before a new moon or a full moon, and used it to drive the calves away from cows whose milk was to form a part of the offerings for the next day's special ceremony. The flame of the forest is mentioned in the description of the landscape of Punjab in Khushwant Singh 's A History of the Sikhs Vol. 1 . He writes, \"While the margosa is still strewing the earth with its brittle ochre leaves, the silk cotton, the coral and the flame of the forest burst into flowers of bright crimson, red, and orange . \" References to this tree are often found in Punjabi literature. The Punjabi poet Harinder Singh Mehboob employed its symbolism in his poems. In Rudyard Kipling 's short story Beyond the Pale (contained in Plain Tales from the Hills , published in 1888), he says of the dhak: The flower of the dhak means diversely \"desire\", \"come\", \"write\", or \"danger\", according to the other things with it. The tree was also featured in The Jungle Book in the story Tiger! Tiger! as the tree Mowgli instructs his wolf-brother Grey Brother to wait under for a signal that Shere Khan has returned. Cultural associations According to legend, the tree sprang from a falcon's feather that was infused with soma. The right side of Yama's body is where the plant, according to Vayupurana, had its start. This lovely tree is revered by both Hindus and Buddhists . It is said to have used as the tree for achieved enlightenment, or Bodhi by second Lord Buddha Medha\u1e45kara Buddha . In West Bengal , it is associated with spring , especially through the poems and songs of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore , who likened its bright orange flame-like flower to fire. In Santiniketan , where Tagore and Vishalnarayan lived, this flower has become an indispensable part of the celebration of spring. The plant has lent its name to the town of Palashi , famous for the historic Battle of Plassey fought there. In the state of Jharkhand , palash is associated with folk tradition. Many folk literary expressions describe palash as the forest fire. The beauty of dry deciduous forests of Jharkhand reach their height when most trees have shed their leaves and the Palash is in its full bloom. Palash is also the State Flower of Jharkhand. It is said that the tree is a form of Agni , the God of fire and war. In Telangana , these flowers are specially used in the worship of Shiva on occasion of Shivaratri . In Telugu , this tree is called Moduga chettu . In Kerala , it is called plasu , chamata or vishalnarayan . Chamata is the vernacular version of Sanskrit word harinee , small piece of wood that is used for agnihotra or the fire ritual. In most of the old Nambudiri (Kerala Brahmin) houses, one can find this tree because this is widely used for their fire ritual. Tamil Brahmins have a daily agnihotra ritual called Samidha Dhanan , where barks of this tree is a main component for agnihotra, and this ritual is very essential for brahmachari s during the first year of brahmacharya . Palash in full bloom at Ranchi in Jharkhand, India Gita Govinda In Sanskrit, the flower is extensively used as a symbol for the arrival of spring and the colour of love. Jayadeva in the Gita Govinda compares these blossoms to the red nails of Kamadeva or Cupid, with which the latter wounds the hearts of lovers. The imagery is all the more appropriate as the blossoms are compared to a net of kimsuka flowers (\u0915\u093f\u0902\u0936\u0941\u0915\u091c\u093e\u0932\u0947). In a completely leafless tree, the blossoms look like a net. The following stanza is translated by Barbara Stoller Miller ; for kimsuka blossoms, she uses the common name \"flame tree petals\": \u092e\u0943\u0917\u092e\u0926\u0938\u094c\u0930\u092d\u0930\u092d\u0938\u0935\u0936\u0902\u0935\u0926\u0928\u0935\u0926\u0932\u092e\u093e\u0932\u0924\u092e\u093e\u0932\u0947\u0964 \u092f\u0941\u0935\u091c\u0928\u0939\u0943\u0926\u092f\u0935\u093f\u0926\u093e\u0930\u0923\u092e\u0928\u0938\u093f\u091c\u0928\u0916\u0930\u0941\u091a\u093f\u0915\u093f\u0902\u0936\u0941\u0915\u091c\u093e\u0932\u0947\u0965 Tamala tree's fresh leaves absorb strong scent of deer musk.

{"id": "doc_fixed_073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoja", "text": "For the American pornographic actress, see Stoya . Stoja Novakovi\u0107 ( Serbian Cyrillic : \u0421\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0430 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b ; born 4 June 1972), known mononymously as Stoja ( Serbian Cyrillic : \u0421\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0430 ), is a Serbian hardcore-folk singer. Recognised as one of the most popular turbo-folk performers, Stoja is noted for her strong deep voice and often eccentric appearances. She released her first album, Kako je meni sada , in Lazarevi\u0107 Production in 1998. Later, she released her albums in the record label Grand Production . Within a short time, Stoja became one of the most popular singers in the Balkans. She is currently signed to BN Music , and has recently released songs with IDJ and Balkan Star too. Early life Novakovi\u0107 was born on 4 June 1972 in the village of Perlez , in the Zrenjanin , Vojvodina municipality in northern Serbia. Her father Milan was born in Puki\u0161 , a village in the Lopare municipality in northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina , and her mother Katica was from Vojvodina . Stoja has a younger brother \u017divko. She was raised in Perlez, where she lived until the age of 25. When describing her childhood, Stoja said; \u201c We had a hard life, we were poor. I was an energetic girl and caused problems for my parents. I was drawn to do everything I shouldn't. \" According to Stoja, her father had a nice voice and he often sang sevdalinke , and she often listened to him. As a young girl she liked Marina Perazi\u0107 , Bajaga i instruktori , Bijelo Dugme and Madonna . She is said to have received her uncommon and strong voice from her father, Milan, but her talent was discovered by her teacher Sida. Sida, who led the second class, suggested that Stoja should go to a singing competition that was organized for students from the first to fourth grade, as well as to be the first voice of the choir . The competition went well, she won first place, and lived up to teacher Sida's expectations. Her father was not supportive of her singing career and they didn't speak for years because she decided to pursue that career path. It was only after her mother intervened that they reconciled. After finishing elementary school, she enrolled in a commercial high school in Zrenjanin . On third school year, she decided to get married at the age of 16. Career Beginnings (1987-1997) Novakovi\u0107 began singing as an amateur in kafanas and discoth\u00e8ques in 1987. According to her, she started singing accidentally. She went to the local neighbourhood Slava where she sang for the first time. She quotes from that night; \" Tips were flying in all directions, everyone was on tables and chairs. When we finished, the head of the orchestra told me not to go anywhere until we split the tip because I deserved it. My purse was full of money, I couldn't close it. \". The band she sang with, came to her house and propose the idea to her of singing again with them. After her husband died in a car accident, she had to move out of his parents house where she was living with their son, and moved to her friends house. She continued singing, and eventually moved to Novi Sad , then Bor\u010da near Belgrade . One night she was noticed by composer Stevan Simeunovi\u0107 , upon which they started collaborating. In 1997, she began recording an album for the record label Lazarevi\u0107 Production. Kako je meni sada ( How am I doing now ), her debut studio album, was released in 1998, with songs like: Da, da, da ( Yes, yes, yes ) and a duet with Serbian folk singer Mile Kiti\u0107 on the song: Takva je Ljubav ( Such is love ) That first album became a big success. Later that year, she signed with the label Grand Production , owned by Lepa Brena and Sa\u0161a Popovi\u0107 , and released her second album, \u0106iki, \u0107iki in 1999. The album featured multiple hit songs, the biggest being \"\u0106iki, \u0107iki\". The title song \"\u010ciki, \u010diki\" and the track \"Ne\u0107u da ostarim\" ( I\u2019m not going to get old ) gained the greatest popularity. Television appearances followed, which she admits she was not fond of, but interest in her was growing. Despite the stormy year on the political and social front, Stoja performed throughout Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina . Success (2000-2006) She released her second studio album in 2000 under the name Samo ( Only ). It contained eight new songs and four bonus versions from the previous album. The title song \"Samo\" delighted the listeners and experienced greater success than the previous hit. In the same year, Stoja was named folk singer of the year. In 2001, it won the \"Popularity Oscar\" award in the \"best circulation of the year\" category. The album Evropa ( Europe ) was released in 2002, and the title song gained great popularity in Serbia and the diaspora. Concerts and performances in Germany , Austria , Switzerland and other European countries followed. In addition to the title song, the songs \"Idi, nek' te sre\u0107a prati\" ( Go, Let the luck follow you ), \"Umri\" ( Die ) and others were also well listened to, and considering that she also included previous hits on that album, the listeners could recall the songs \"Samo\", \"Ne\u0107u da ostarim\" ( I won't grow old ) and others. The title song from that album, and one of Stoja's greatest hits, song \"Evropa\" ( Europe ), can be heard in episode 19 of Bosnian TV series Viza za budu\u0107nost ; that is when many people in Bosnia and Herzegovina started to listen Stoja, and since then she has been notably popular in this country; Stoja herself uploaded the mentioned insert from the series on her official YouTube channel. She released her next, fifth studio album in 2003 under the name Zakletva ( Oath ). And then she treated the audience with eight new songs, among which \"\u017diveo\" ( Live long ), \"Da zavolim ludo\" ( To Fall Madly in Love ), \"Samo idi\" ( Just go ) and others stood out. After that, there was a new turn in her career. She decided to completely change her appearance, lost more than twenty kilograms, dyed herself blue and released the ballad \" Starija \" ( Older ), which represented something completely different from the songs she had previously sung. The album of the same name was released on the market in 2004, and besides the title track, \"Diamonds\", \"Da se\u010de\u0161 vene\" ( To cut your veins ) and others were also heard. \"Starija\" was declared folk album of the year. Stoja released the EP Osveta with two songs in 2006 with the band Ju\u017eni Vetar . Two years later, in 2006 she released her seventh studio album under the title Metak ( Bullet ). There were eight new songs on it, including a duet with \u0160ako Polumenta called \"Gde god podjem tebi idem\" ( Wherever I go, I go to you ), \"Ne slu\u0161aj vesti\" ( Don\u2019t listen to the news ) and one of her most acclaimed songs in her career \"Ne\u0161to mi govori\" ( Something is telling me ). The audio of that song has 53 million views on her YouTube channel as of 2024. Both the title song and the duet song were well received by the audience. That year, Stoja was declared the best folk singer in BiH, and her song \"Metak\" won the \"Belgrade Winner\" award. Acclaimed Success (2008-2015) In 2008, she released her most acclaimed album Do gole ko\u017ee ( To the bare skin ) by the Grand Production Company. The title song and track \"Ku\u010dka\" stood out from this album, for which Stoja released attractive videos. The ninth studio album appeared on the market already the following year under the title \"Naj, naj\". The most popular songs from that album are \"Are you for sex\", \"Zamalo\", \"Ja\u010da nego pre\", \"Naj, naj\", \"Potopicu ovaj splav\" and her most famous song, a duet with Dejan Mati\u0107 \"Muzika\" ( Music ), which has over 21 million views on Grand Productions YouTube channel. The song \"Revolucija\" ( Revolution ) and its music video were both released in October 2010. The video caused some stir in the media because it featured Stoja bathing in a bathtub full of peppers. Her tenth studio album entitled Nije da nije ( It's Not That It's Not ) was released on 6 May 2013 by the Bosnia-based label BN Music , marking the first time in 15 years that Stoja has released an album with a production company other than Grand Production. Following the release of Nije da nije , Stoja began releasing non-album singles including \" Bela ciganka \", \" Ola ola \", \"Takvog de\u010dka ho\u0107u ja\", \"Lila lila\", and \"Ti brate ima\u0161 sve\". Her song \" Bela ciganka \" ( White Gypsy ) which was published on her YouTube channel, became an international success with over 100 million views as of 2024, making in one of the most viewed videos on Balkan . Album Bela ciganka was released in 2015; it includes old hits, as well as new such as \"Kao ovde nigde nije\" (first song, displayed on cover). Two singles were released the next year: \"Ponovo\" and \"Ko pre\u017eivi neka pri\u010da\". BN Music published her single \"Lila, Lila\" in February 2015. Stoja hired a proven good team of collaborators for this song as well, so success was not lacking. The track has so far been viewed more than 10 million times on YouTube. In October of the same year, she presented the single \"Kao ovde nigde nije\", which became one of the most requested songs at performances abroad. Tours all over Europe followed, and she organized a big concert for her listeners in Sofia, Bulgaria , which was attended by more than 18,000 people. Now (2015-present) In the following period, singles with music videos are released by Stoja: \"Bomba\" (2017). In April 2017, with young singers Relja Popovi\u0107 and Coby , they released the song \"Samo jako\" (\"Just go hard\") which samples her song from 2000 \"Samo\" from her album Samo in April. In one show, she admitted that this type of music was not close to her, but she decided to support her dear colleagues. The collaboration was immediate success, and the song gained 77 million views on YouTube. In May 2018, Coby and Stoja released the duet \"Cista hemija\", whose lyrics were written by Petar Lugonja and Vuka\u0161in Jasni\u0107, and music and arrangement by Veljkovi\u0107. The song divided Stoja's fans into those who like her and those who think she should return to the music she did a few years ago. \"Ne treba mi \u017eivot\" (2017), \"\u010cista hemija\" (music video in which she is dressed like Gaddafi ; ft Coby, 2018), \"Ko bi rekao\" (ft Kija Kockar , 2018), \"Idi mami pa se \u017eali\" (2019), \"\u017dena sa Balkana\" (ft Mimi Mercedez , 2019), \"Svet se vrti oko nas\" (ft Mimi Mercedez , 2019), \"Taki taki\" (2019), \"Neka pati\" (ft Milan, 2019) and \"Aj, chiki, chiki\" (ft Ludi Srbi, 2019).

The last release in 2019 was Geto Gerila remix of Stoja's hit \"\u0106iki, \u0107iki\" (same-named album, 1999) entitled \"Aj, chiki, chiki\" and published on 20 December. Stoja had announced release of song \"Lice\" which was not published then because of 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic ; the song was published in June 2020. In June 2021 she released song \"Hera\" with Balkan Star label. Stoja released \"Da li ona zna\" (\"Does she knows\") on her YouTube channel in June 2023. Stoja has been working with her long-time friend and lyricist Stevan Simeunovi\u0107 who is author of almost all her songs since her career has started. Personal life Relationships Novakovi\u0107 was first married at age 16, became a mother at 17 and was widowed at 19 when her first husband lost his life in a 1991 car crash, ending their three-year marriage. When talking about her husband, she said; \"I knew my first husband from the village. He was from a rich farming family and much older than me. One day he came to my father to propose me. Dad told him that it will be as I decide. I was 16 years old and I got married literally right out of school. After a few months, I became pregnant and it was a real shock for my parents. It wasn't a problem for me. I went to school pregnant and graduated. My first husband was attentive to me and I had a carefree life. He looked after our son and me and did not allow anything to disturb us. Whenever I wanted to do something, he would tell me that there was no need because he had enough money for everything.\" The period after his death was financially difficult for her. She was quoted as saying \"I was very poor. I did not have anything to eat.\" She became a grandmother at age 33 when her son Milan's first child was born. Since 2007, she has lived in Belgrade , more specifically the Be\u017eanijska kosa neighborhood in New Belgrade . Novakovi\u0107 married architect Igor Jovanovi\u0107 on 1 November 2009, after being in a relationship for five years. Their relationship has been on-again-off-again, with the couple constantly breaking up and getting back together. In a March 2014 interview, Novakovi\u0107 revealed that she once attempted suicide by driving her car into a wall to keep their marriage from dissipating. Family On 4 October 2011, Stoja found her mother Katica, who had heart problems and diabetes , dead in bed after being suspicious when Katica did not emerge from her bedroom that morning. Stoja survived a car accident on 28 May 2012 when her car was totaled after being hit by a truck. She escaped with a minor injury to the forehead. Stoja has said that her favorite singer is \u0160emsa Suljakovi\u0107 and she has frequently covered Suljakovi\u0107's songs at concerts and television appearances, and was even interviewed with her in June 2012. Cosmetic surgeries Stoja is known for numerous cosmetic procedures and exceptional figure, which has accompanied her since the beginning of her career. Stoja is one of the first people from Serbia 's showbusiness world to admit that she went to Turkey for cosmetic surgery and that it cost a lot (the figure of over 100,000\u20ac is also mentioned). The surgeries were mostly corrective and aimed at getting a more beautiful figure, because Stoja has been struggling with \"extra pounds\" since the beginning of her career. - I know that! When I change, I change everything! This summer I promised to lose weight and do something new. I tried and it worked, I'm really happy. I spent 10 days and two months recovering in Turkey. It still hurts, I was immobile for 3-4 days - she said and added: - I was in an artificial coma for nine and a half hours. I would not like to talk about the figure, but it is somewhere around 100,000\u20ac. When you say Turkey, everyone knows that it is not very cheap and easy, but I am very satisfied - concluded Stoja for Pink.rs . After these corrections, Stoja specially secured one part of her body: - I secured my butt like J.Lo . It's not exactly a million like her, because we live in Serbia, but in accordance with our financial possibilities - the folk singer pointed out.

{"id": "doc_fixed_074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaye_Radisich", "text": "Jaye Amber Radisich (29 March 1976\u00a0\u2013 17 March 2012) was an Australian politician. She was a Labor Party member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly from 2001 to 2008, representing the electorate of Swan Hills . Radisich was the youngest woman ever to be elected to the Western Australian parliament. Early life Radisich was born and raised in Perth, Western Australia . At 12 years of age, she was awarded a Citizenship Award from the City of Stirling Council for her all round academic performance and community involvement. Radisich attended Mount Lawley Senior High School . In Year 12, Radisich was appointed as School Prefect, Caltex All-rounder, and Belle of the Ball. Radisich was also a member of the Senior Debating Team and a participant on numerous committees including the Student Council, Common Room and Amnesty International. Radisich went on to study arts, law and commerce at the University of Western Australia . Radisich became involved in student politics while at university, and served as a member of the National Union of Students executive, and the Vice-President (Asia-Pacific) of the International Union of Socialist Youth . While at university, she worked two jobs, as a check-out operator at a budget cosmetics chain and a research officer. She was juggling these commitments with the final year of her degree when she won pre-selection to contest the theoretically safe Liberal seat of Swan Hills as the Labor candidate for the 2001 state election. Political career Swan Hills was held by a sitting Liberal minister in the Court government, June van de Klashorst , and in the leadup to the poll, there was little sign that she was in any danger of losing the seat. In a major upset, the Labor vote increased enough that Radisich was able to narrowly defeat van de Klashorst with the assistance of Liberals for Forests and One Nation preferences. She became the second-youngest person, and the youngest woman, to be elected to the Western Australian parliament. She faced re-election at the February 2005 election, and was widely expected to lose her seat, due to the surprise result that had elected her in 2001 and a redistribution that had further slashed her tenuous margin. Radisich herself claimed that \"many people\" had anticipated her defeat. However, as the election drew closer, some analysts began to predict that she could hold on. These assertions were proved correct when, on election day, Radisich received a swing of more than 3%, and held onto her seat. Radisich served as Chair of the Economics and Industry Standing Committee from 2005 to 2007. In 2006 Radisich tabled a report on the production and marketing of foodstuffs. The report examined the market dominance of the major retail chains and also analysed issues relating to the health and safety of our food, labelling requirements and the production and marketing of foodstuffs. The committee recommended a new way forward in support of consumer information about the food we eat that is grown, farmed or fished in WA by way of a voluntary state of origin certification and marketing program. Radisich's parliamentary service culminated in her appointment as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Energy, Resources, Industry and Enterprise in April 2007. Radisich also served on the Joint Standing Committee on the Anti-Corruption Commission and the Public Accounts Committee during her term. In the leadup to the 2008 state election , Radisich sought preselection for the new seat of West Swan , a safer seat for Labor than the more marginal Swan Hills. However, after reports stating that she would likely lose in any preselection contest for West Swan to Rita Saffioti , the chief of staff to Premier Alan Carpenter , she announced that she would retire from politics at the next election. Radisich expressed a desire to pursue other ambitions, including post-graduate study and public policy interests at a Federal level. Graham Giffard , a then-sitting MLC, won Labor Party pre-selection for Swan Hills and lost the seat to the Liberal candidate Frank Alban in the 2008 election . Post-political career Council of Small Business Australia In February 2009, Radisich was selected from 160 applicants for the position of chief executive officer at the Council of Small Business Australia (COSBOA). During her tenure, Radisich successfully lobbied to prevent the Australian Federal Communications Minister from extending the \"Do Not Call\" Register to business numbers. She also oversaw a twelvefold increase in revenue. Radisich demonstrated a solid track record of working with the private sector as CEO of COSBOA. She formed a partnership between COSBOA, Telstra and the Federal Government to deliver information to small businesses about new, modernised awards following the introduction of the Fair Work Act in July 2009. Radisich resigned from the position in May 2010. Illness and death Initial diagnosis In 2002, during the early months of her first parliamentary term, Radisich was diagnosed with adult wilms tumour , a rare form of cancer. She had the kidney containing the tumour removed and continued to work as a member of parliament while undergoing subsequent chemotherapy . Secondary diagnosis In November 2010 Radisich was again diagnosed with a wilms tumour in her remaining kidney. Radisich underwent surgery to remove the tumour while preserving her kidney, followed by a course of chemotherapy . Radisich was informed that no further treatment for the cancer was required in June 2011. A routine scan conducted in October 2011 revealed that the cancer had aggressively returned and she was informed that surgery and cancer treatments available in Australia would not remedy her condition, only prolong her death. Radisich underwent Sonodynamic, Photodynamic, P53 Gene, Ozone and Dendritic Cell therapies in Xi'an , China from October til December 2011. Due to a lack of accessible and accurate information available about the alternative treatments, she maintained a blog to share her experience with other cancer sufferers also considering the treatments. The alternative treatments in China ultimately proved unsuccessful. The cancer continued to spread and Radisich succumbed to her condition at approximately 11\u00a0am, 17 March 2012, aged 35.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade\u00a0II listed building . History The site has been occupied since before 1327. The oldest surviving part of the present house dates from 1595, when it was built for Thomas Dod. In 1873 the house was extended, incorporating fabric from the older house, by the Chester architect John Douglas . This was commissioned by Sir\u00a0Philip de\u00a0Grey Egerton of Oulton Park as a dower house . Late-19th century occupants of the Hall included the calico printer William Graham Crum JP (son of the Scottish chemist Walter Crum and father of John Macleod Campbell Crum ). It was purchased by Malcolm Walker, owner of the Iceland Food Store Chain, in 1985 for \u00a3750,000, and re-modelled and extended for him by The Carnell Green Partnership in 1987\u201388. Architecture The house is timber-framed with oak frames and plaster panels. The roofs are of stone slates and have ornate bargeboards and finials . The chimneys consist of detached diagonal flues . The house is in two storeys. The original part of the house has four bays and two gables and a gabled porch. To the left of this part of the house is a recessed wing with one gable and to its right is a projecting wing with one gable. To the sides of each of these are further recessed wings, that to the left having a further gable. The windows are of oak; those in the upper storey have mullions and those in the lower storey have mullions and transoms . The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner described it as being \"an ornate gabled black and white house\". The lodge to the hall is also listed Grade\u00a0II. It is dated 1873, is a timber-framed building on a brick plinth and was designed by John Douglas. It has one storey and is in Jacobethan style. Gardens The grounds of the hall contain a formal garden, garden terraces, lawns, a lake, follies and a yew avenue. The grounds are not open to the public. In the garden is a structure cut into a cliff and partly lined with blocks of sandstone . It dates from the early 19th\u00a0century or before. Its base measures around 6m square and it is 4m high. On the floor are stone flags and the ceiling slopes to a central ridge. To its right is a shallow partly natural cave. The structure is a Grade\u00a0II listed building. It has been described variously as a \"stone parlour\", a grotto, or King James' Parlour.

After a career-best ten goals in 28 matches in 1974\u201375 , he caught the attention of S.L. Benfica , where he would however appear rarely over the course of two Primeira Liga seasons. After reviving his career with his first club, Romeu moved in 1979 to FC Porto , where he would be much more used than at Benfica, in a four-season spell. The northern side however, only won one Portuguese Supercup , in 1981. Aged 29, Romeu joined the last of the Big Three , Sporting Clube de Portugal . Except for his debut campaign , he would not be more than a fringe player as the team came totally empty on silverware, and finally retired in 1988 after one-year spells with modest S.C. Salgueiros and Amora FC (the latter in division two ). In the 90s/2000s, Romeu had several spells as a manager, also working with Benfica as a scout and match observer (1999\u20132001).

Concepts In an interview with New Noise Magazine vocalist Michael Lessard stated that \"Level 3 is a slight continuation of Level 2, but it\u2019s not all about video games. It evolves from the concept of the character from the previous album transcending from the second dimension into the third, it\u2019s kind of a twisty, turny thing in that, but it\u2019s not about video games this time. It\u2019s a different animal.\" Commenting on the writing process Lessard stated \"The processes were similar but there were different musicians in the mix, so that made for a different creative process just dealing with different people. Generally, it was kind of the same thing but there was a little more distance between us so we had to use the interwebs a little more than usual.

{"id": "doc_fixed_084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMBC_Nikko_Securities", "text": "SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. (SMBC\u65e5\u8208\u8a3c\u5238\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e) is a securities firm in Japan which engages in the operation of large-scale comprehensive securities broking and trading services. The company was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan . It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group . It is the third largest securities brokerage firm in Japan. History The origins of SMBC Nikko Securities can be traced back to a company named Kawashimaya Shoten (\u5ddd\u5cf6\u5c4b\u5546\u5e97) which was formed in July 1918 by Genichi Toyama. It was formed to buy and sell stocks and bonds. In 1920, the firm was created out of the securities department of the Industrial Bank of Japan and incorporated as a stock company. In 1939, Kawashimaya Shoten spun off its securities division forming Kawashimaya Securities. In 1943, Kawashimaya Securities absorbed Kawashimaya Shoten. In 1944, Kawashimaya Securities and Nikko Securities merged, and the resulting company used the Nikko Securities trade name. In 2001, the firm changed its name from Nikko Securities to Nikko Cordial Securities. In 2007, the firm became a subsidiary of Citigroup after Citigroup purchased Nikko Cordial Corporation forming Nikko Citi Holdings Inc . In September 2009, Citigroup sold the firm to the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation . In 2011, the firm changed its name from Nikko Cordial Securities to SMBC Nikko Securities. In 2016, the firm became a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group. In 2018, the firm merged with SMBC Friend Securities, while continuing to use the SMBC Nikko Securities trade name. Controversies 2012 insider trading fine In April 2012, the Financial Services Agency fined the firm for leaking information about a stock offering which was considered insider trading . Directors of the firm passed on word of the offering to at least 21 sales branches without carrying out the proper internal procedures to control the information flow. At eight of those branches a total of 23 sales staff tipped off 34 clients to purchase the shares once the deal was launched. The deal was said to be a roughly 1\u00a0trillion yen ($12.4\u00a0billion) offering by Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Nikko's parent, in early 2010. Investigation into block trade market manipulation In November 2021, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) launched an investigation into the firm over suspicious stock transactions. The firm was suspected of using its proprietary trading desk to illegitimately maintain the price of stocks in block trades . The firm launched a complaint with financial regulators after a senior trader died following intensive questioning. On 4 March 2022, four employees of the firm were arrested on allegations of market manipulation in connection with the same block trades. The employees were Trevor Hill (Head of equity), Alexandre Avakiants (Deputy head of equity), Makoto Yamada (General manager of equity trading ) and Shinichiro Okazaki (General manager of structured products ). The firm's President & CEO, Yuichiro Kondo issued a public apology afterwards. On 24 March 2022, prosecutors arrested a vice president of the firm and brought criminal charges against the company and five bankers. On 13 April, prosecutors charged the vice president and filed new criminal charges against the firm. On 14 February 2023, a court ordered SMBC Nikko Securities to pay a fine of 700 million yen ($5.3\u00a0million) and an additional penalty of around 4.47\u00a0billion yen for manipulating stock prices.

{"id": "doc_fixed_086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacker_rock", "text": "Slacker rock (originally known as lo-fi or lo-fi indie ) is a subgenre of indie rock that emerged in the United States during the late 1980s to early 1990s. Characterized by a rejection of technical proficiency and production quality, in favor of stripped down lo-fi aesthetics and an apathetic singing style. The style was originally associated with Generation X slacker culture . However, experienced a resurgence during the 2000s and 2010s amongst Millennials and Gen Z . Notable acts include Pavement , Built to Spill , Sebadoh , the Microphones , Silver Jews and Guided By Voices . Etymology and characteristics Slacker rock was initially intertwined with \" slacker \" culture which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s amongst Generation X , with its association with a specific cultural attitude being primarily popularized by director Richard Linklater 's 1990 cult film , Slacker . The term \"slacker\" described a teenager that showcased a nonchalant attitude and general blas\u00e9 approach to life. Slacker rock became musically reflective of slacker culture, employing less emphasis on technical proficiency and production quality, in favor of stripped down lo-fi aesthetics and an apathetic singing style. History 1980s\u20131990s: Origins See also: Indie rock and Lo-fi music Slacker rock emerged out of the American indie and college rock scene, originally drawing influence from alternative rock bands like Sonic Youth , Pixies , and Dinosaur Jr. as well as 1980s cassette era lo-fi artists like Beat Happening and Daniel Johnston , earlier influences included New Zealand 's Dunedin sound which featured bands such as the Clean and Chris Knox 's Tall Dwarfs . During the 1980s, slacker rock first came to prominence through the indie rock scene, though initially referred to as \"lo-fi\", the music was associated with bands like Guided by Voices who formed in 1983 and treated low-fidelity analog recording as an intentional musical aesthetic, which had previously been viewed as a negative technological limitation. By the late 1980s to early 1990s, the American lo-fi movement began to gain prominence in the alternative and DIY underground music scene, with the sound evolving into a distinct indie rock genre popularized by bands like the Lemonheads , Camper Van Beethoven and Pavement . Later bands like Built to Spill , Sebadoh , and Sparklehorse , further proliferated the movement. Slacker rock saw its commercial height in the 1990s with popular artists like Beck . 2000s\u20132020s: Revival In the 2000s, the indie music scene experienced a resurgence in analog technology and retro aesthetics brought upon by the popularity of genres like chillwave and hypnagogic pop , which brought about a re-interest in cassette culture and early lo-fi and slacker rock bands. In the 2010s, slacker rock experienced a revival spearheaded by artists like Mac DeMarco , Alex G and Car Seat Headrest , as well as artists like Kurt Vile , Vivian Girls , Courtney Barnett , and Ovlov . Subsequently, slacker rock's resurgence would later influence the bedroom pop movement.

Representatives of the Thirteen Colonies met in New York City in 1765 as the Stamp Act Congress to discuss a unified response to the abuses exemplified by the 1765 Stamp Act and other legislation from the British Parliament deemed contrary to the British constitution . A result was the Declaration of Rights and Grievances passed on October 19, 1765. This deliberative body and the Declaration it produced was at the other end of the resistance spectrum from the Sons of Liberty , who were at the same time using civil disobedience and public displays to agitate for British reform in the colonies. American colonists opposed the acts in large part because they were passed without consultation with colonial legislatures, violating their rights as Englishmen . The Declaration of Rights raised fourteen points of colonial protest but was not directed solely to the Stamp Act. Among the assertions it made that were not specific protests of the Stamp Act are the following: Colonists owe to the crown \"the same allegiance\" owed by \"subjects born within the realm \". Colonists owe to Parliament \"all due subordination\". Colonists possessed all the rights of Englishmen . Trial by jury is a right. The use of Admiralty Courts was abusive. Without voting rights , Parliament could not represent the colonists. There could be no taxation without representation . Only the colonial assemblies had a right to tax the colonies.

{"id": "doc_fixed_088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Verdery", "text": "Katherine Verdery (born 1948) is an American anthropologist , author, and emeritus professor, following her tenure as the Julien J. Studley Faculty Scholar and Distinguished Professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York . Career She used to be the Eric R. Wolf Professor of Anthropology and Director of the Center for Russian and East European Studies at the University of Michigan (1997\u20132005), following twenty years as an assistant/associate professor of anthropology at the Johns Hopkins University (1977\u20131997). Verdery played a number of important roles in academic research institutions. The first anthropologist to be elected to the presidency of the National Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (2004\u20132006), she also held important advisory positions (such as on the Board of Overseers, Harvard University , and the Board of Electors, William Wyse Professorship and Chair of Social Anthropology , Cambridge University ). From 1987 to 1990 she was the American Anthropological Association 's representative to the American Council of Learned Societies / Soviet Academy of Sciences Commission on Ethnography, and from 1989 to 1990 she was the vice president of the Romanian Studies Society . She served on the National Council for Soviet and East European Research as trustee (1989\u20131996), an executive board member (1991\u20131993), and chair of the board (1995\u20131996). From 2002 to 2005, she was a member of the executive board of the Social Science Research Council , as a representative for anthropology. She also served on the boards of the American Anthropological Association and the American Ethnological Society. Academics Among the first anthropologists to conduct research behind the Iron Curtain , Verdery spent an extended period working in Romania in the 1970s\u20131980s. From this research she published eight books and numerous articles, as well as several edited collections, all informed by her theoretical model of socialism. Her work placed her in the forefront of scholars of the socialist system, both in anthropology and more broadly. Her primary themes were ethno-national identity; the political economy of Romania before, during, and after socialism; property relations; and ethnography in the archives of the communist-era Romanian Secret Police , a topic she pioneered. Having worked in Romania for an extended period in the 1970s\u20131980s, she was extensively surveilled by the Securitate under the Ceau\u0219escu regime, which incorrectly suspected her of spying. After Ceau\u0219escu's fall , she was able to view her surveillance files through the National Council for the Study of the Securitate Archives ( CNSAS ). Her book My Life as a Spy: Investigations in a Secret Police File describes the files' contents and her reactions to seeing them.

{"id": "doc_fixed_090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start-up_Nation", "text": "Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle is a 2009 book by Dan Senor and Saul Singer about the economy of Israel . It examines how Israel was able to reach such economic growth that \"at the start of 2009, some 63 Israeli companies were listed on the NASDAQ , more than those of any other foreign country.\" In 2010, Start-up Nation was ranked fifth on the business bestseller list of The New York Times . It also reached The Wall Street Journal bestseller list. Despite claims in the media that Dan Senor coined the phrase \"start-up nation\" in 2009, the phrase was featured in American technology media at least since November 2000 in an article by Stacy Perman titled \"Startup Nation\" describing Israel. Book overview The Council on Foreign Relations stated in its publisher's blurb for the book that Start-up Nation addresses the question: \"How is it that Israel\u2014a country of 7.1 million people, only sixty years old, surrounded by enemies, in a constant state of war since its founding, with no natural resources\u2014produces more start-up companies on a per capita basis than large, peaceful, and stable nations and regions like Japan, China, India, Korea, Canada, and all of Europe?\" The Economist noted that Israel had more high-tech start-ups and a larger venture capital industry per capita than any other country in the world. The Economist described Start-up Nation as the most notable of a \"growing pile\" of books on the success of Israel's technology sector. In their attempt to explain Israel's success in this area, Senor and Singer discard \"the argument from ethnic or religious exceptionalism, dismissing 'unitary Jewishness' or even individual talent as major reasons for Israel's high-tech success\" and analyze two major factors that, in the authors' opinion, contribute most to Israel's economic growth. Those factors are mandatory military service and immigration . The authors argue that a major factor for Israel's economic growth can be found in the culture of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), in which service is mandatory for most young Israelis. The authors suggest that service in the IDF equips future entrepreneurs with a broad range of skills and valuable connections. They assert that the IDF provides experience in taking on responsibility within a relatively flat organizational structure. IDF soldiers \"have minimal guidance from the top, and are expected to improvise, even if this means breaking some rules. If you're a junior officer, you call your higher-ups by their first names, and if you see them doing something wrong, you say so.\" Neither ranks nor ages matter much \"when taxi drivers can command millionaires and 23-year-olds can train their uncles,\" and \"Israeli forces regularly vote to oust their unit leaders.\" The book also dwells at length on immigration and its role in Israel's economic growth: \"Immigrants are not averse to starting from scratch. They are by definition risk-takers. A nation of immigrants is a nation of entrepreneurs. From survivors of the Holocaust to Soviet refuseniks through the Ethiopian Jews, the State of Israel never ceased to be a land of immigration: 9 out of 10 Jewish Israelis today are immigrants or descendants of immigrants, the first or second generation. This specific demographic, causing fragmentation of the community that still continues in the country, is nevertheless a great incentive to try their luck, to take risks because immigrants have nothing to lose.\" Additional factors cited by the authors include a sense of dissatisfaction with the status quo, a culture that encourages experimentation with technology, and government policies that support start-ups. Using stories and anecdotes, the book provides examples of Israel's technological and medical achievements, among them \"the Israeli innovations that made possible Google Suggest, the list of suggestions that appear instantly in menu form as you type a search request, the capsule endoscopy, a miniature camera embedded in a pill so that 18 photos per second can be wirelessly and painlessly transmitted from gastrointestinal tracts.\" The book highlights Israel\u2019s numerous achievements in technological innovation, but also examines why Israel has yet to produce its own major corporations. The authors attribute this partly to the tendency of Israeli startups to be acquired by large foreign companies and partly to mismanagement. To write the book, Senor and Singer interviewed over 100 individuals, including Israeli venture investors, historians, U.S. military officials, and Israeli heads of state. they conclude that \"while Israel has much to learn from the world, the world has much to learn from Israel.\" Authors Dan Senor is a former foreign policy official in the United States government. He served as chief spokesman for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq and now advises venture capital firms. Saul Singer is a columnist and former editorial page editor for The Jerusalem Post . Critical reception Praise Jon Rosen of USA Today believed that the book is written from an Israeli perspective and could frustrate those opposed to the nation's foreign policy . However, he still considered it an accomplishment, \"not simply for exposing the roots of Israel's success, but by showing what the Israeli case might teach the rest of the world.\" In The Wall Street Journal , James K. Glassman said that \"the greatest strength of Start-up Nation is not analysis but anecdote. The authors tell vivid stories of entrepreneurial success, such as that of Shai Agassi, the son of an Iraqi immigrant to Israel, with his electric-automobile technology, now in the process of creating 'Car 2.0.'\" Publishers Weekly stated that \"the authors ground their analysis in case studies and interviews with some of Israel's most brilliant innovators to make this a rich and insightful read not just for business leaders and policy makers but for anyone curious about contemporary Israeli culture.\" In The Economic Times , R Gopalakrishnan wrote that the use of Hebrew expressions made the book \"alive and eminently-readable.\" Gopalakrishnan concluded that the ideas demonstrated in the book \"are highly relevant for innovation capability in general, but for India, especially at this juncture.\" David Horovitz of The Jerusalem Post said that conclusions of Start-up Nation are validated by real-world events, such as the treatment given to Gabby Giffords after the 2011 Tucson shooting , where an emergency medical team used a elasticized bandage developed in Israel to control her head wounds. A review in The Washington Post says that \"the book weaves together colorful stories of Israeli technological triumphs\" such as the story of Shvat Shaked , who \"founded a cybersecurity firm with his old buddy from Army intelligence and had the chutzpah to bet a top executive at PayPal, the online commerce company owned by eBay, that his few dozen engineers could beat PayPal's thousands in developing secure online software.\" The review also states that the authors could have done a better job drawing \"straight lines between their theories about Israel's success and these case studies\". Maureen Farrell of Forbes was disappointed that the authors mostly ignored the effects of United States foreign aid to Israel . This percentage was as high as ~13% during some years of the first decades after 1950, according to The Times of Israel . She says the book \"is worth reading to understand not just Israel's history but the history of capitalism and innovation.\" Criticism Ruth Schuster, reviewing the book for Haaretz , feels that it is \"tarnished by a jarring, tub-thumping patriotism.\" A review in The Christian Science Monitor notes that \"critics say that the story behind how a country of 7 million has more Nasdaq-listed companies than Europe is more complex than Singer and Senor paint it to be.\" Yusuf Mansur , writing in The Jordan Times , contends that two factors cited by Senor and Singer as key to Israel\u2019s success\u2014the IDF and Soviet-Jewish immigration\u2014have only been sustainable due to foreign aid from the United States and private sources. Mansur also criticizes the authors for attributing the gap in entrepreneurship between Israel\u2019s Palestinian and Jewish communities to Arabs and Palestinians' exemption from military service, instead of what he views as \"Israel\u2019s discriminatory policies against its Arab citizens,\" particularly in areas of education and employment. Gal Beckerman, writing in The Forward magazine, observes that the book \"presents Israel in an extremely positive light as a bastion of entrepreneurial spirit and technological achievement. It skirts a discussion of the conflict with the Palestinians , or even the wealth inequality within Israel, thereby dovetailing nicely with recent public relations efforts by Israel to shift attention away from its problems and toward its achievements.\" Impact Journalists and policymakers in several countries have recommended Start-up Nation as a useful guide for promoting entrepreneurship. A review of the book in The Irish Times calls on Ireland to follow Israel's model. Andrius Kubilius , the prime minister of Lithuania , has cited Start-up Nation as his favorite book. Yrj\u00f6 Ojasaar, managing partner of Solon Partners, an executive consulting and angel investor company in Estonia , says \"there is much to be learned from the Israeli experience of venture capital incubation through building incentives for privatization.\" CNN 's Fareed Zakaria called Start-up Nation \"a book every single Arab businessman, Arab bureaucrat, and Arab politician should read.\" The book is cited as a handbook of \"classic economics.\" It teaches small businesses \"how effective a cohesive team can be, especially when that team emphasizes chutzpah first.\" Former Palestinian prime minister Salam Fayyad reportedly kept a copy of Start-up Nation on his desk as a source of inspiration for the West Bank 's own burgeoning technology industry.

{"id": "doc_fixed_092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Meckler", "text": "Nancy Meckler is an American-born director, known for her approach to theatre, specifically her work in the United Kingdom with Shared Experience , where she was a joint artistic director alongside Polly Teale . Educated in the US and England, she has directed for a number of prominent theatres, including the Globe Theatre, the Royal National Theatre, and the Royal Shakespeare Company. She has also directed feature films such as Sister My Sister , and Alive and Kicking/Indian Summer . Early life and education Meckler is native to Long Island, New York. It was there that she began to take interest in the arts, though directing was not her original passion; at first she wanted to be an actor. She was initially attracted to theatre because of its ability to expose audiences to new and different worldviews. Meckler attended several academic institutions in the US, beginning with Antioch College for her undergraduate degree, then moving on to study acting at HB Studios. Finally, she obtained a master's degree in Performance Theory and Criticism from NYU . Meckler also spent a year in London training at the London Academy for the Dramatic Arts. After this, her focus slowly moved to directing; she realized she did not want to be in the spotlight, but still had a strong interest in theatre. Her future directorial pursuits were greatly steered by the New York avant-garde scene of the 1960s; her influences at the time included Jerzy Grotowski , a prominent experimental and avant-garde figure of the era. She moved to London in 1968, a time when many American artists were relocating to the UK, permanently changing the theatre scene in the places they landed. Career Once in the UK, Meckler founded the Freehold Theatre Company (1968\u201372), which, while it did not last long, had a successful and recognized production of the play Antigone . In 1970, Antigone was sent by the British Council to represent the UK at BITEF and the Venice Biennale . The Freehold Theatre Company won the John Whiting Award for New Writing in 1970. Freehold Theatre Company disbanded after Meckler started her family, but she returned to theatre shortly after, becoming the associate director at Hampstead Theatre . During this time, Meckler struggled with the constraints of directing traditional scripted plays and the structure of British theatre, as her work in the past had been more creative and experimental. In 1984, having outgrown the Hampstead scene, Meckler and her husband, David Aukin , who she had been working with at Hampstead, relocated to Leicester Theatre in London. There, Meckler went on to direct the plays of authors such as Shakespeare and other traditional playwrights, but alongside that, she returned to her more experimental pursuits through freelance directing. Meckler was the first woman to direct at the Royal National Theatre , with Edward Albee 's Who's Afraid of\u00a0Virginia Woolf? in 1981. She was the artistic director of Shared Experience Theatre , a fringe theatre company in London, from 1988 to 2011. The company is known for its non-traditional approaches to theatre, namely their tendency to stage well known plays in a way that has not been done before. Meckler has directed 5 plays at the Royal Shakespeare Company as well as King Lear at Shakespeare's Globe .

Both films contain LGBTQ+ subject matter, Robin Griffiths has categorized Sister My Sister as a notable queer British film. Reviewers described Meckler's direction as theatrical; her experience as a stage director clearly present in her on screen work. Various reviewers interpreted this style of directing in different ways, with some saying it adds to the films, and others saying it detracts from them. Sister My Sister , Meckler's most popular film, falls into a common trope of killer or murderous queer people, with the main characters, two sisters working as maids, plotting to kill their employer. However, Meckler's work stands out from others in this trope because it was directed by a woman; this is uncommon for the genre. The film portrays a controversial relationship, an incestuous lesbian romance between two sisters. Ballet Meckler was the director of A Streetcar Named Desire for the Scottish Ballet .

Incumbent Democratic senator Jon Tester successfully ran for reelection to a second term, gaining 48.6% of the vote against Republican U.S. Representative Denny Rehberg who received 44.9% of the vote and Libertarian candidate Dan Cox received 6.56% of the vote.

General election Candidates Dan Cox (Libertarian), retired businessman Denny Rehberg (Republican), U.S. Representative, former lieutenant governor and former state representative Jon Tester (Democratic), incumbent U.S. Senator and former state senator Debates Three debates were scheduled, including one with the Libertarian candidate whose ultimate influence on the race remains uncertain. The first, between Rehberg and Tester, was held on October 8, 2012, at 7 p.m. at Petro Theatre at the MSU Billings University campus. The debate was televised live by Montana PBS andbroadcast on KEMC/Yellowstone Public Radio and streamed on the Gazette's website. It was moderated by Steve Prosinski, editor of The Gazette, with questions from a panel of political reporters. Representatives from the Associated Students of Montana State University Billings, the student government, served as timekeepers. Complete video of debate , October 8, 2012. Complete video of debate , October 20, 2012 Campaign Former president of the Montana Senate and farmer Jon Tester was elected with 49.2% of the vote in 2006, defeating incumbent Conrad Burns . As of June 30, 2011, Jon Tester had saved $2.34 million in campaign funds. Tester has been accused by Republican Denny Rehberg's senate campaign of depending on financial contributions from Wall Street banking executives and movie stars. On February 5, 2011, U.S. Representative Denny Rehberg announced his intention to run for the U.S. Senate. Steve Daines had announced he would seek the Republican nomination on November 13, 2010, but just before Rehberg's announcement he dropped out of the primary and announced he would instead seek the Republican nomination for Montana's at-large congressional district in 2012 . Daines later won Montana\u2019s other U.S. Senate seat in 2014 . As of early July 2010, Denny Rehberg had saved $1.5 million of an original $2 million in campaign funds. Rehberg accused Democrat Jon Tester's senate campaign of depending on financial contributions from Wall Street banking executives and Hollywood while Rehberg's campaign relies primarily on in state donations. Tester's campaign countered that Rehberg has been funded by petroleum special interests and Wall Street. The National Republican Senatorial Committee aired an attack ad against Jon Tester that mistakenly included a digitally manipulated photo of Tester (who has only two fingers on his left hand) with full sets of fingers. Another ad against Tester, from the Karl Rove group Crossroads GPS , falsely asserted that Tester had voted in favor of Environmental Protection Agency regulation of farm dust. In fact, Tester had praised the EPA for not attempting such a regulation. The vote cited in the anti-Tester ad concerned currency exchange rates. In early October 2012, Crossroads GPS announced it would launch a $16 million advertising buy in national races, of which four were this and three other Senate elections.

Top industries Predictions Polling Hypothetical polling Results Tester won re-election to a second term, albeit by a narrow margin. He received about 4% more of the vote than Republican Rehberg, but the difference in Tester and Rehberg's vote totals was less than the vote total of Libertarian Dan Cox, who received 6.6% of the vote.

{"id": "doc_fixed_098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Country", "text": "This article is about the 2009 movie. For the music genre, see Gothic country . Dark Country is a 2009 American mystery thriller film directed by and starring Thomas Jane in his directorial debut. It also stars Lauren German and Ron Perlman . Plot Newlyweds Dick and Gina decide to head across the Nevada desert for their honeymoon, driving at night to beat the heat. Before they head off, a stranger warns Dick to be careful, as couples have been known to get lost, and to stick to the Interstate. Shortly afterward, the couple realize they are heading the wrong way and turn off the highway onto another road. Dick turns off the car headlights to drive by starlight and Gina masturbates herself to orgasm as they head across the desert. Eventually Dick turns the lights back on, immediately swerving to avoid a figure in the middle of the road. Investigating, they find a man severely injured from a car accident. Unable to get a phone signal, they decide to drive him to a hospital themselves, only for the road to come to a sudden end a few miles ahead. During the drive, the couple argue and the injured man awakens with a scream. He asks Gina for a cigarette, advises her to leave her husband and becomes increasingly erratic, finally attempting to strangle Dick and almost causing the car to crash. Gina stops the car and the two men tumble out, continuing to fight until Dick beats the stranger to death with a rock. Dick convinces his wife they need to dispose of the body, and together they bury it in a shallow grave. While she fills the hole, Dick finds a revolver in her handbag. Soon after, they arrive at a rest area where several cars are parked. They tidy themselves up and argue until Dick discovers he lost his watch while they were burying the stranger. Refusing to go back, Gina waits at the rest stop with the gun while Dick returns to find his watch. Arriving at the site where they hid the body, Dick finds the grave empty. Gunshots ring out across the desert and Dick races back to the rest stop to find Gina is missing. Nearby, he stumbles onto a woman's grave and realizes that the other cars are rusted and covered with dust. In a panic, he flees, almost colliding head-on with a deputy sheriff. In the back of the police car, he rides with the deputy to a crime scene, where police are excavating murder victims from a mass grave surrounded by abandoned vehicles. The deputy explains that this was where the rest area had been 30 years before. Dick recognizes the spot as the location where he buried the stranger. As he watches on from the back of the police car, a deputy exhumes Gina's body and finds Dick's watch. Dick kicks his way out of the patrol car and escapes in one of the nearby vehicles, leading the squad of police in a chase across the desert. Driving with the lights off, he loses them, but a short while later he finds a swarm of insects, losing control and rolling the car. Thrown clear of the wreck, he is then almost run down by another car before he passes out. Some time later, Dick wakes to find himself in the back of his own car, listening to himself and Gina argue, and realizes that he was the mysterious stranger that he fought with and murdered earlier in the evening, screaming at this. Cast Thomas Jane as Dick / Bloodyface Lauren German as Gina Ron Perlman as Deputy Thompson Con Schell as Bloodyface Double Chris Browning as Stranger Rene P. Mousseux as Crime Scene Trooper Production The idea for making Dark Country came after Jane had read the short story by the film's writer Tab Murphy . After working for a year on the story, Jane and Murphy brought it to Lionsgate , who purchased the script. Upon learning Jane's intention to shoot the film 3D, Lionsgate backed out of the deal and allowed Jane and Murphy to take the script to Sony Pictures , whose home video division were looking for content for their new line of 3D televisions that were soon to be released. The inspiration Jane had cited for making the film came from his admiration for the horror films of old and film noir , in addition to The Twilight Zone , The Outer Limits and old issues of EC Comics comic books. \"I wanted to make a movie that was for people who enjoy movies that are off the beaten track, you know?\" said Jane. \"I wanted to make a movie for fans of cult films, for fans of \"The Twilight Zone\" , for guys who stayed up late to watch \"The Outer Limits\" when they were probably too young to do that.\" Before filming began, Jane, together with his storyboard artist, story boarded every shot, approaching the film like they were doing a live-action graphic novel. Wanting to have graphic novel elements, Jane brought on-board comic artist Tim Bradstreet to work as the visual consultant and production designer, in addition to Berni Wrightson , who provided the designs for the character Bloodyface, and Ray Zone as the 3D supervisor. Jane chose to do the film in 3D as a way to prove to the filmmaking community that you could create a low-budget film in 3D and have it turn out looking great. The 25-day shoot took place in Albuquerque , New Mexico . The film was shot in both 3-D high definition and 2-D high-def, with the intention of a limited theatrical run in 3D. The 3D for Dark Country was done using two Silicon Imaging (SI) HD heads capturing at 2K resolution, the cameras were built by Hector Ortega and Stephen Pizzo of Element Technica, and supervised by Geoff Boyle, Max Penner, Tim Thomas and Paradise FX in California. The small size of the cameras allowed for more fluid camera movements compared to the cameras previously used to shoot 3D films. For the filming of scenes in 3D, Jane wished for the effect to vary in intensity and be impactful. To help in that, Jane devised a color-coded system for his cameraman to know how he wanted the 3D to be visually in any particular scenes. If I wanted the 3D to be popping-off the screen in a particular shot \u2013 I had a color code for that. If the 3D was to be deep in the background so that you get a real sense of depth, that was another color code. And there were colors for the middle ground. I indicated wherever the 3D would be and map it through the movie \u2013 because I think it can be overstimulating. Thomas Jane has voiced his disappointment over the fact that the studio didn't give the film a theater run, rather releasing it on DVD and not in the 3-D format in which it was intended. Further disappointment comes with the fact that the released cut of the film is far from Jane's preferred version. Release Dark Country was released on DVD on October 6, 2009 in North America by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment and Stage 6 Films . On April 1, 2011, French distributor Metropolitan Filmexport released a Blu-ray 3D edition of the film. A graphic novel adaptation of Dark Country by Swiss artist Thomas Ott was released on May 30, 2012, by Raw Studios through comiXology as a digital download. Critical reception Upon its release Dark Country received mixed reviews, though many reviewers praised Jane's acting and directing style. David Ray Carter of PopMatters said of the film, \" Dark Country throws its whole body into its final sucker punch only to miss by a mile. Jane shows flashes of talent as a director, but he'd be better served with stronger material for his next effort.\" Robert Fure of FilmSchoolRejects.com remarked that \"Dark Country is not a perfect film, but it's a much better film in 3D. The story isn't groundbreaking and again I'll mention The Twilight Zone , but the acting is top notch from Jane, the style of the film is very much grounded in the comic world, and several scenes are over the top awesome. If nothing else, Jane has proven two things: The guy can direct and 3D is awesome.\" JimmyO of JoBlo.com gave the film a positive review stating, \"With Dark Country , his directorial debut, he manages to pump a ton of noir-ish atmosphere into what could have been a by the numbers thriller. Sure you may figure out the big secret pretty quickly, I did, but Dark Country is a visually intense thriller that keeps you watching.\" Conversely David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews gave the film 1 out of 4 stars, stating that \"It's clear right from the opening frames that Jane is going for a hyper-stylized throwback to the film noir thrillers of the 1950s, yet, despite his best efforts, the first-time filmmaker is simply unable to transform the two protagonists into figures worthy of the viewer's interest and sympathy. Jane's reliance on visuals that are almost astonishingly garish.\" And concluding that \" Dark Country ' s pervasive lack of compelling elements cements its place as a misfire of impressively epic proportions (and this is to say nothing of the laughably nonsensical twist ending, which would seem like a stretch within a David Lynch film).\" Jeff Allard of Shock Till You Drop stated of the films problems \"If the same story were told in less time, it might've worked better. This is a half-hour or hour-long anthology episode at best, not a feature. Even with a brief 88 minute running time, Dark Country feels like it's taking excessively long to get to its climax and by the end, what should be an ironic wallop is more of a shoulder shrug.\" While ultimately praising the performances of Jane and German, he concluded that \" Dark Country is a noble effort that takes too many wrong turns and ends up getting lost. For fans that find themselves jonesing for a Twilight Zone -esque tale or some noir atmosphere, however, your mileage may vary.\" See also List of films featuring time loops References ^ a b c d e Michael Fleming (2007-11-13). \"Thomas Jane lights up 'Dark Country' \" .

Brickman in 1898 and currently owned and run by Gordon and Macphail of Elgin . It is situated near Forres in Moray and is fed with spring water from the Chapelton Springs in the Romach Hills beside Forres . History Duncan MacCallum and F.W. Brickmann founded the Benromach Distillery Company in 1898. Duncan MacCallum had previously been working at the Glen Nevis Distillery in Campbeltown and FW Brickmann was a spirit broker in Leith , Edinburgh . Construction work started at the site of Benromach Distillery in 1898 however due to the depression in the Scotch Whisky industry in 1898 the distillery did not start producing whisky until 1900 but closed the same year due to a lack of money. In 1911 Benromach was acquired by the London based Harvey McNair & Co who continued distilling until the onset of the First World War . After the war Benromach was acquired by Benromach Distillery Ltd and was run by this new private company until 1925. In 1938 Benromach was acquired by Associated Scottish Distilleries Ltd which later became a part of Scottish Malt Distillers Ltd . Between 1966 and 1974 the distillery was modernised and continued to run until 1983 when the distillery was officially closed. In 1993 Gordon and MacPhail took over the site and in 1997 they started to restore the distillery to a working order. The design of the distillery was changed slightly to allow it to be operated by one man. Finally in 1998 the distillery was officially reopened by Charles, Prince of Wales and bottling of the new malt started in 2004. At the World Whisky Awards 2014, Benromach 10 Years Old won gold in the \"Best Speyside Single Malt \u2013 12 Years and Under\" category. Scotland's Malt Whisky Trail is a tourism initiative featuring seven working Speyside distilleries including Benromach, a historic distillery ( Dallas Dhu , now a museum) and the Speyside Cooperage . According to a BBC article, visitors can try some of the whiskies and \"see the traditional dunnage warehouse (where the whiskys are stored to mature), the mash tun, the burnished copper stills \u2014 and the cask signed by Prince Charles\". The distillery released its first gin, Red Door, in July 2018. The gin is vapour-infused with eight botanicals, including rowan berries and sea buckthorn The gin was named after the distillery's painted-red doors; a dedicated gin tour was launched at Benromach in August 2019. A limited release winter gin followed later that year.

{"id": "doc_fixed_101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove_Cycle", "text": "Glove Cycle is a 1984 public art installation by Mags Harries , located throughout the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Porter subway and commuter rail station in Porter Square , Cambridge, Massachusetts . The artwork consists of 54 separate bronze pieces and was created with a budget of US$ 30,000. Sculpture Glove Cycle is a sculptural installation of 54 separate bronze sculptures of gloves located throughout Porter station. Individual gloves are located on a turnstile and between the up and down escalators . Small piles of gloves are located at the bottom of the escalators and on the inbound platform, while other gloves are embedded in the floor of both platforms as well as the mezzanine. The gloves are arranged, some in small vignettes, to have different stories and emotions connected to them. Richard Wolkomir of Smithsonian Magazine explains that the first gloves one approaches in the station are \"a big glove giving birth to a little glove\", and that \"Some gloves have two thumbs, or only three fingers. One large glove extends a finger toward a smaller glove, like a caricature of Michelangelo 's Jehovah transmitting life to Adam on the Sistine ceiling .\" Robert O. Boorstin from The Harvard Crimson adds that there are gloves \"in piles, gripping rails, pushing imaginary buttons\u2014as a constant image that the passenger follows from one point of the station to another\". Mags Harries explains that the gloves she crafted \"are anthropomorphic objects with many character possibilities and by their multiplication, take on a life form that might be analogous to the people movement in the subway.\" Robert O. Boorstin claims that this philosophy and explanation are \"somewhat extravagant.\" History Interior of Porter station showing the inbound platform Glove Cycle was created as a part of the MBTA and the Cambridge Arts Council's \" Arts on the Line \" program. This first of its kind program was devised to bring art into the MBTA's planned Northwest Extension of the Red Line subway stations in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and became a model for similar drives for public art across the country. This installation was one of 20 artworks created for this program, out of over 400 proposals submitted by artists for artworks spread out across five different newly created subway stations. The first 20 artworks, including this one, were completed with a total cost of $695,000 USD , or one-half of one percent of the total construction cost of the Red Line Northwest Extension. The cost of this particular sculpture was $30,000. Gloves was not the first theme that Harries considered for her subterranean artwork. Initially her concept revolved around bronze tree roots appearing to come through the walls and into the stations. This idea was turned down by the architects of Porter Station for bringing attention to the fact that the station is deep underground. Harries stated, \"The whole philosophy of subway stations, it turns out, is to make them seem as un-underground as possible,\" something the tree roots idea would be the exact opposite of. The next theme she considered was to create a flock of sheep-shaped turnstiles. This concept fell to the wayside as the snow from a blizzard in Boston began to melt. Harries began to find lost gloves emerging from the snow. She said that, \"They were wet, compacted, squashed\u2014really beautiful!\" These lost items gave her the inspiration for her new sculptural theme, gloves. Three of the gloves were stolen during the sculpture's first decade by vandals who broke them out of walls. References ^ a b Glove Cycle Archived 2012-04-22 at the Wayback Machine .

{"id": "doc_fixed_102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Bernstein", "text": "Leslie Bernstein (October 9, 1939 \u2013 July 28, 2022) was an American cancer epidemiologist and biostatistician. Known particularly for her research on breast cancer , in 1994 Bernstein led a ground-breaking study that found a correlation between moderate exercise and breast cancer risk reduction. Bernstein received many awards for her research, including from the American Association for Cancer Research , and was described as the \"mother of cancer epidemiology\" by City of Hope . Personal life and education Bernstein was born on 9 October 1939 in Long Beach , California . During her youth, she was a nationally ranked swimmer. She graduated from Hughes Junior High in Long Beach and started her studies at the University of California, Los Angeles at the age of 16, earning an undergraduate degree in mathematics in 1959, having initially hoped to become a statistician . When she was 18, she married Saul Bernstein, a physical education student who had similar aspirations to work in medicine . Recognising they could not afford to pay two sets of tuition fees, Bernstein paused her studies to raise their children while her husband trained as a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon . During the Vietnam War , Bernstein's husband was drafted, and the family relocated to Kansas and subsequently Georgia , where he treated wounded soldiers. They later spent a period of time in the United Kingdom, where Bernstein's husband completed his medical fellowship. After a 17-year break, Bernstein resumed her studies at the age of 36 at the University of Southern California . She went on to obtain a master's degree in gerontology in 1978 and a PhD in biometry in 1981, at the age of 41. Bernstein was married until her husband's death in 2010, and they had three children together. Bernstein died on July 28, 2022 at the age of 82. Career and research After receiving her PhD in 1981, Bernstein worked as a researcher and professor at the USC Keck School of Medicine for 25 years, before officially retiring in 2007. She went on to serve as the director of the cancer aetiology at the Beckman Research Institute City of Hope, a cancer research and treatment centre. During her career, Bernstein led several ground-breaking studies. In 1994, she identified that people could reduce their risks of developing breast cancer through moderate exercise, becoming the first researcher to highlight the links between exercise and cancer survival. In 2017, Bernstein participated in a study that found the use of low-dose aspirin could reduce the risk of developing breast cancer in women. In addition to her breast cancer research, Bernstein also contributed to research on other forms of cancer, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma and oesophageal cancer , as well as into the long-term impact of cancer treatments on survivors. Alongside Jonine Bernstein, Bernstein worked on the twenty-year Women's Environmental Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) study, which was the largest study of genetic susceptibility and risk for second primary breast cancer in women already diagnosed with the disease. In 1995, she co-founded the California Teachers Study, a cohort of 133,479 female public school professionals, which studied the impact of health behaviours on disease development through completing regular questionnaires with participants. Bernstein served as the California Teachers Study's Principal Investigator between 2006 and 2016. Bernstein joined the American Association for Cancer Research in 1996, and served as a council member for its Women in Cancer Research group from 2011 until 2013. She also worked closely with the National Breast Cancer Coalition as a proponent for patient advocacy. Her additional support of the NBCC included joining them in testifying before Congress , and taking part in work to dispel myths around abortion being a cause of breast cancer. Recognition In recognition of her cancer prevention research, Bernstein received the AACR\u2013 Prevent Cancer Foundation Award for Excellence in Cancer Prevention Research in 2007, and the AACR\u2013 American Cancer Society Award for Research Excellence in Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention in 2018. She also received recognition the Abraham Lilienfeld Award for Lifetime Contributions to Epidemiology, in addition to awards from the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, the American Society for Preventative Oncology, and the University of Southern California. Bernstein also received recognition for her prominence as a woman in science, as well as for her commitment to mentoring female students, researchers, and faculty members throughout her career. For this, she received City of Hope's Lifetime Achievement Mentoring Award, as well as the Rosalind E. Franklin Award for Women in Science.

Career Our Lady Peace In 1993, Jim Newell, the band's previous drummer, left Our Lady Peace due to commitment issues. The remaining members and their management held open auditions for his replacement. They auditioned over a hundred drummers, ultimately choosing Taggart, who was 17 at the time. The band offered him the drumming position, which Taggart accepted. Our Lady Peace had also recently been given a record deal with Sony Music Canada. In June 2014, Taggart announced that he had left Our Lady Peace and was not coming back. Other projects In addition to drumming for Our Lady Peace, Taggart has worked on various side projects, including providing the drums on Chantal Kreviazuk 's song \"Blue\", Geddy Lee 's song \"Home on the Strange\", and The Beautiful Unknown 's song \"Riot in the House of Ruin\". He also appears in the music video for Chad Kroeger and Josey Scott 's song, \" Hero \", off the Spider-Man soundtrack .

{"id": "doc_fixed_108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_for_Science_Fiction", "text": "The National Association for Science Fiction ( NASF ), New Zealand 's first national science fiction club, was formed in December 1975 by Wellington resident Frank Macskasy. The club expanded over several years and by the early 1980s had branches in Wellington, Auckland , Christchurch and Dunedin , and was for nearly 15 years New Zealand's only nationwide science fiction fan organisation. The logo of NASF - a kiwi , representing New Zealand, superimposed on a stylised rocket History Members in Auckland, Wellington and Dunedin were involved in running national conventions, although none were officially run by NASF, and in many of the fanzines that sprouted up in the late '70s and early '80s, as well as amateur press association Aotearapa . NASF was also a motivating force behind the inauguration of a New Zealand Science Fiction fan awards in the late 1980s (these later reappeared as the Sir Julius Vogel Awards ), and was also the umbrella organisation responsible for the appointing of host sites for national conventions . At its height in the mid-1980s, NASF had a membership of about 150 and a bimonthly club magazine called Warp . By the mid-1990s, the Auckland and Christchurch branches had folded, although there were still club members in those areas. The Dunedin branch and the Wellington branch continued until the late 1990s. Debate continues on why NASF died, as well as whether it was officially wound up, but it was largely inactive by the mid 1990s and went into indefinite recess in late 1997. The rise of science fiction as a popular genre in the cinema and television, coupled with easier access to science fiction books, magazines, movie and television series on video, and later DVD, possibly contributed to NASF's demise. Considerable infighting within the Wellington and Christchurch branches may also have contributed, along with an unwieldy National Committee. The Phoenix Science Fiction Society was founded in Wellington specifically as an alternative to what was seen as a moribund branch of NASF, draining many active fans away from NASF. Other factors included the growth of the internet, which made an organised club less relevant. In contrast to when Macskasy formed NASF in 1976, by the late 1990s, New Zealanders could soak themselves in science fiction without any need to meet other people with the same interest. Many of the national functions of NASF were later taken up by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Association of New Zealand (SFFANZ), which was founded in 2002. Branches Dunedin branch The Dunedin branch of the National Association for Science Fiction (NASF) existed from 1978 until the late 1990s. The branch was the first science fiction club formed in Dunedin and for many years was the southernmost science fiction club in the world. It held fortnightly meetings (later monthly), initially at the children's library in Stuart Street , then at various other venues, the last of which was the W.E.A. building in Crawford Street. The branch organised social events and outings and ran a small lending library. About a dozen people attended the first meetings, but it took till the middle of the year for the official formation of the branch. Membership began to increase as a side effect of Dunedin winning the rights to hold the New Zealand National Science Fiction Convention , Octacon, in 1982. There was also a jump in social gatherings with members meeting every weekend and on some week days. By 1983, the Dunedin branch was the most socially active within NASF and second in size only to the Wellington branch. Branch members were instrumental in staging other national conventions in Dunedin in 1986, 1989 and 1994. Dunedin branch members contributed to the NASF club fanzine Warp which was edited from Dunedin for several years, but the branch itself did not have a regular branch fanzine or newsletter other than the short-lived Larque's Lament , which ran for five issues in the late 1980s, and a one-off fanzine called Can\u2019t Think of a Name So We Called it This! in 1982. Several branch members were also members of Aotearapa , or published their own fanzines, notably Tom Cardy's Worlds Beyond , which ran for 11 issues.

His early NASA assignments have included work on rocket upper stages such as PAM , IUS , and Centaur , as well as Shuttle software verification at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL). In addition, he was the Astronaut Office training coordinator, worked on various Department of Defense payloads, served as a spacecraft communicator ( CAPCOM ) at Mission Control for STS-41-D , STS-41-G , STS-51-A , STS-51-C and STS-51-D , worked Space Station issues for the Astronaut Office, and served as head of the Mission Development Branch within the Astronaut Office. In May 1985 he was named to the crew of STS-61-F , which was to deploy the Ulysses spacecraft on an interplanetary trajectory using a Centaur upper stage. This mission was to have flown in May 1986, but the Shuttle Centaur project was terminated in July 1986, and Hilmers then worked in the areas of ascent abort development, payload safety, and Shuttle on-board software. During 1987 he was involved in training for STS-26 and in flight software development. He later became head of the Mission Development branch in the astronaut office. A veteran of four space flights, he has logged over 493 hours in space. He served as a mission specialist on STS-51-J (October 3\u20137, 1985), STS-26 (September 29 to October 3, 1988), STS-36 (February 28 to March 4, 1990), and STS-42 (January 22\u201330, 1992). Space flight experience STS-51-J Atlantis , a classified Department of Defense mission, launched from Kennedy Space Center , Florida , on October 3, 1985. This was the maiden voyage of the Orbiter Atlantis . Hilmers had prime responsibility for a number of on-orbit activities during the mission. After 98 hours of orbital operations, Atlantis landed at Edwards Air Force Base , California, on October 7, 1985. STS-26 Discovery , the first mission to be flown after the Challenger accident , was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 29, 1988. During the four-day mission, the crew successfully deployed the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-C), which was subsequently carried to orbit by the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) rocket.

Hilmers replaced Manley Lanier \"Sonny\" Carter Jr. , killed in a plane crash, for his last mission. STS-42 Discovery launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on January 22, 1992. Fifty-five major experiments conducted in the International Microgravity Laboratory-1 module were provided by investigators from eleven countries, and represented a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines. During 128 orbits of the Earth, the STS-42 crew accomplished the mission's primary objective of investigating the effects of microgravity on materials processing and life sciences. In this unique laboratory in space, crew members worked around-the-clock in two shifts. Experiments investigated the microgravity effects on the growth of protein and semiconductor crystals. Biological experiments on the effects of zero gravity on plants, tissues, bacteria, insects and human vestibular response were also conducted. This eight-day mission culminated in a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on January 30, 1992. Post-NASA experience Hilmers decided to apply to medical school while training for his third shuttle flight. He attended pre-med courses at night while training for his fourth flight.

{"id": "doc_fixed_122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaconing", "text": "Meaconing is the interception and rebroadcast of navigation signals. These signals are rebroadcast on the received frequency, typically with power higher than the original signal, to confuse enemy navigation. Consequently, aircraft or ground stations are given inaccurate bearings. Meaconing is more of a concern to personnel in navigation ratings than to radio operators. However, communications transmitters are often used to transmit navigation signals. Since communications personnel operate the transmitters, they must know how to deal with any communications problems resulting from meaconing. Successful meaconing can cause aircraft to be lured into \"hot\" (ambush-ready) landing zones or enemy airspace, ships to be diverted from their intended routes, bombers to expend ordnance on false targets, or ground stations to receive inaccurate bearings or position locations. The term 'meacon' is a portmanteau of masking beacon . Alleged cases of meaconing Iran says it used this technique (among others) to capture a USAF RQ-170 Sentinel drone, causing it to crash land. Meaconing in this case could provide a drone with false altitude measurements, causing a crash landing. Acronym MIJI (Meaconing, Intrusion, Jamming, and Interference) In popular culture In the film Tomorrow Never Dies , a military GPS signal is meaconed to send a Royal Navy frigate off course. In the novel and miniseries of the John J. Nance novel Pandora's Clock , an attempt to warn the airliner about an impending attack is summarily dismissed as an attempt at meaconing. The villain of Die Hard 2 changes the Dulles Airport 's ATC beacon altitude to below ground level, causing planes' altimeters to provide false readings, thus causing landing planes to crash.

{"id": "doc_fixed_123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_M._MacEachran", "text": "John Malcolm MacEachran (January 16, 1877 \u2013 1971) was a Canadian philosopher and psychologist , whose most notable credentials involved the development of the Psychology and Philosophy Department at the University of Alberta . He was a co-founder of the Canadian Psychological Association and the appointed Chairman of the Alberta Eugenics Board which was responsible for approving the sterilization of thousands of Albertans , hundreds of which were without consent. Early years (1877-1909) John Malcolm MacEachran was born in Glencoe , Ontario in Canada to David and Christina MacEachran. After finishing his primary education in the public school system of Glencoe, he was admitted to Queen's University in Ontario. There, MacEachran obtained an MA in Mental and Moral Philosophy (1902), became the appointed assistant to Professor John Watson , and obtained his first PhD in 1906. Following his apprenticeship, MacEachran traveled to Berlin , Germany , where he worked with the well-known scholars Friedrich Paulsen and Carl Stumpf , further increasing his knowledge of modern psychology, ethics , and the philosophy of education . MacEachran then officially commenced schooling in Germany where he became a student of the psychologist/philosopher Wilhelm Wundt at the Leipzig University (1907). Here he wrote his doctoral thesis Der Pragmatismus (1909) earning him his second PhD. MacEachran then traveled to Paris where he studied sociology under \u00c9mile Durkheim and took a class under Alfred Binet , who had recently developed the IQ test (1908). MacEachran's academic relationship with Henri Bergson spurred his interest in combining the disciplines of philosophy and biological science. Dr. MacEachran accepted an offer from the then newly founded University of Alberta to head its Department of Philosophy and Psychology in 1909. University of Alberta years (1909-1945) In 1909, J.M. MacEachran was appointed head of the Department of Psychology and Philosophy at the University of Alberta. As the head of a new department, MacEachran fabricated the curriculum from scratch and in his first year at the U of A, MacEachran offered introductory courses in experimental and modern psychology . As the program developed, MacEachran made junior and senior level courses available and in 1911, he made it possible to graduate with a M.A and B.A in the field of psychology. Other classes that were added to the curriculum included: psychology and logic , comparative psychology (animal evolution , child psychology and racial psychology), physiological psychology , abnormal psychology and psychology of religion . At this point, MacEachran had developed and supported the whole of the undergraduate philosophy and psychology programs and supervised at least one Masters level student. He MacEachran also began administrative duties for the university in 1911, and officially accepted the position as the University of Alberta's first Provost in 1912. All of these responsibilities earned him a salary of $4,900. During the First World War (1916-1918), J.M. MacEachran enlisted as captain in the 196th Western Universities Battalion on March 15, 1916. He also served with the 19th Reserve Battalion , the C.E.F. Young Soldiers' Battalion , and the 13th Brigade C.F. in France . After MacEachran's return to the University of Alberta after World War I (1918), a central focus was developing applied psychology. Courses such as applied psychology, educational psychology , industrial psychology , legal psychology and psychology and economic problems were introduced into the curriculum. While studying at Leipzig University , Wilhelm Wundt lectured to MacEachran that experimental psychology would have to be meticulously studied for two or three centuries before it was to be applied \u2013 MacEachran installed applied psychology at the University of Alberta only one decade later. In 1938 MacEachran co-founded the Canadian Psychological Association and became the first honorary President in 1939. With the additional faculty, the number and range of classes broadened. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, laboratory psychology was crafted. In August 1945, after shaping the Department of Philosophy and Psychology, and much of the Universities' administrative routine, MacEachran retired as Emeritus Professor of Philosophy. His successor was John MacDonald. In 1960 the Department of Philosophy and Psychology split into independent departments. Alberta Eugenics Board (1928-1965) J.M. MacEachran was appointed Head of Alberta Eugenics Board in 1928, immediately after the Alberta government enacted the Sexual Sterilization Act . MacEachran was appointed Chairman for the purpose of developing a philosophical justification for the eugenics movement. He was an ideal candidate for the position because of his extensive background in philosophy and psychology. The purpose of the Alberta Eugenics board is outlined in section 4(1) of the Sexual Sterilization Act : Section 4(1) of the Sexual Sterilization Act empowered the medical superintendent of a mental hospital to cause a patient of the mental hospital whom it proposed to discharge to be examined by or in the presence of the eugenics board, with a view to sterilization. Section 5 of the Act established two grounds for sterilization: that procreation by the person under consideration would result in the transmission of any mental disability or deficiency to his or her progeny or involved the risk of mental injury either to such a person or his or her progeny. J.M MacEachran of Edmonton (U of A, Chairman), E.L. Pope of Edmonton (U of A, Professor of Medicine ), E.G. Mason of Calgary , and Mrs J.H Field of Spurfield (Secretary) were the original four members of the board whose job was to approve or reject patients for sterilization with respect to the guidelines of the Sexual Sterilization Act . Five years after the first meeting of the Alberta Eugenics Board in 1929, at the annual meeting of the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) in 1934, it was noted that 288 cases had been approved by the Eugenics Board for sterilization, and that 60% of these cases involved serious mental or nervous disease in the patients family record. Two classes of individuals were sterilized - those with low mental IQ's and those who had suffered serious mental breakdowns, and therefore could not be recommended for parenthood by any physician . It was also noted that any operations to be completed on the patients first required personal consent, or consent from family. If no one was eligible to provide consent and the patient was not capable of signing personal consent due to physical or mental barriers, the Minister of Health could do so. In 1933, the Eugenics Board consented that the Chairman, Dr. MacEachran, would have the authority to dictate when an operation for sterilization would take place. Members of the CMA, agreed: Evidence [had] shown overwhelmingly that sterilization [was] a sound, humane and effective procedure, and [was] one of the chief means of coping with the grave problem of the increasingly large number of mentally sick and mentally deficient persons that each province [was] being called upon to care for. In 1937, the Social Credit government passed an amendment that strongly restricted the need for the Eugenics Board to obtain the consent of the patients to be sterilized. This increased the efficiency of the sterilization process, as more patients could be approved for sterilization by the Eugenics board. In the 44 years that the board was empowered by the government of Alberta, 2822 sterilizations were processed. MacEachran resigned from Chairman of the Alberta Eugenics Board on June 30, 1965, serving for 38 consecutive years. During his term as Chairman, MacEachran signed over 3200 applications approving for sterilization of adults and children (~60% of approvals resulted in sterilizations). His successor was R.K. Thomson who was chairman until 1972 when the Sexual Sterilization Act was repealed. University of Alberta ceases honours in MacEachran's name (1990s) In 1975, the University of Alberta's Department of Psychology inaugurated an annual lecture series honouring MacEachran. Every year a distinguished scholar of psychology would be invited to give a lecture to students and faculty in MacEachran's honor. Awards and scholarships were also distributed in MacEachran's honour, first in 1958 and then 1972 with endowments from his estate. After 1972, the Faculty of Education and the Departments of Philosophy and Psychology awarded annual scholarships to students honouring MacEachran's accomplishments. On September 3, 1997, a committee at the University of Alberta voted to rename the lecture series due to MacEachran's involvement in the unlawful sterilization of many Albertans. In 1998, a University of Alberta panel submitted a request to halt the distribution of awards in J.M. MacEachran's name. This request was based on data obtained from the Leilani Muir versus the Province of Alberta trial, which showed that many of the sterilizations were unlawfully approved by the Alberta Eugenics Board. The board, headed by J.M. MacEachran, approved sterilizations without clear evidence that the patient's deficiencies would be transmitted to their progeny. The board approved sterilizations of patients who did not fall into the category of \"mentally defective\". A section of the Sterilization Act stated that upon sterilization, the patient would be discharged from the holding facility and in many instances, patients were sterilized even though discharge was not imminent. The board also approved the sterilization of patients already known to be infertile (patients with Down syndrome ). Furthermore, castrations were approved in order to obtain testicular tissue for research purposes. The board approved sterilizations with the understanding that patient's sexual behaviour would be altered, therefore eliminating sexual deviancy, and also with the goal of stopping menstruation in women. MacEachran had also signed application forms, approving sterilization before the patients had been interviewed by the board. With regards to the Leilani Muir vs. Alberta trial, Madame Justice Joanne B. Veit noted: Dr. Thompson's [a former chair holder of the Alberta Eugenics Board] evidence demonstrates that the operations of the Board initiated on a purported scientific rationale, degenerated into unscientific practices. The decisions of the Board were not made according to the standards imposed on them by the legislation, but because the members of the Board... thought that it was socially appropriate to control reproduction of \"these people\". Because of the previously stated reasons, in 1998, the Department of Philosophy at the University of Alberta stopped giving out rewards honouring MacEachran's name. A single MacEachran award was given out in 2003 from the Department of Philosophy, and then no more thereafter.

The team plays its home games at Saxon Stadium , located on the campus of Mercyhurst University . The SeaWolves adopted the name \"Commodores\" to honor Oliver Hazard Perry , a U.S. Navy commodore who commanded forces from Erie's Presque Isle Bay during the Battle of Lake Erie , a pivotal event in the War of 1812 . Perry's flagship, the USS Niagara , flew the iconic \"Don't Give up the Ship\" battle flag, both elements featured in the Commodores' logo. The Erie Maritime Museum now maintains the Niagara at Presque Isle Bay. History In 2009, local soccer coach Pedro Arg\u00e1ez founded Erie Admirals SC , building upon an existing youth program. John Melody, a former player at Mercyhurst University, initially served as head coach and later took full ownership of the club. On April 24, 2015, Melody rebranded the team as Erie Commodores FC . He appointed Micky Blythe\u2014a fellow Mercyhurst alumnus\u2014as head coach for one season, followed by Neil Brown (holding a UEFA\u202fA License) for the 2015 NPSL campaign. In 2021, they announced addition of a senior women's team to its overall program, to play in the United Women's Soccer League Two. Player development Several Commodores alums have advanced to professional soccer, including: Adam Clement, signed by Vancouver Whitecaps FC (MLS) Sam Dorf, signed by Waterford FC (League of Ireland 1st Division) Jeremy Deighton , Greg Blum, and Neil Shaffer , who played with Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC (USL) Danny Deakin , drafted by Orlando City SC in the 2017 MLS SuperDraft Rust\u2011Belt rivalries and venue changes The Commodores developed rivalries with fellow Rust Belt Conference teams, such as Cleveland SC . In 2020, the club participated in the NPSL Members Cup, alongside Cleveland SC, FC Buffalo , and Pittsburgh Hotspurs . They also contested the Erie County Derby against FC Buffalo until Buffalo's move to USL League Two in 2023. From 2013 to 2021, the team played at McConnell Family Stadium on the campus of Gannon University . In 2022, the Commodores relocated to Saxon Stadium on the Mercyhurst University campus, a facility that seats approximately 2,300 spectators and features a synthetic turf playing surface. Brewers Cup In 2024, Erie revived its rivalry with FC Buffalo through the Erie County Brewers Cup, sponsored by John Russell Brewing (Erie) and Big Ditch Brewing (Buffalo). The two-leg series featured a commissioned tropical IPA, \"Lake Erie Life,\" released by the collaborating breweries. 2025 season During the 2025 NPSL campaign, Erie qualified for the Great Lakes conference playoffs by defeating Cleveland SC on July 5, marking another strong season under the club's continued leadership.

{"id": "doc_fixed_126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battleships_of_Italy", "text": "Battleship Roma in 1940 Starting in the 1890s, the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) began building a series of modern battleships. Early designs were marked by their small size, light armor, and high speed compared to contemporary foreign counterparts. The first pre-dreadnought battleship design, the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class , was constrained by budgetary limits imposed by the legislature. Two ships were ordered by the class's namesake, Admiral Simone de Pacoret Saint Bon , though the design was also influenced by Benedetto Brin , who replaced di Saint Bon as naval minister after his death. Brin designed the next pair of battleships, the Regina Margherita class . These ships were larger than the preceding class, and were intended to challenge the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg -class battleships then under construction. Brin himself died during the construction process. Vittorio Cuniberti designed the next class of small pre-dreadnoughts, the Regina Elena class , which were the fastest battleships in the world at the time of their completion. These ships all served in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911\u20131912, where they were primarily used to provide naval gunfire support for the Italian ground troops, as the Ottoman Navy largely confined itself to port. By the time that the Regina Elena s had been built in the early 1900s, the British battleship HMS\u00a0 Dreadnought had been completed, a revolutionary design that rendered all previous battleships obsolete. Therefore, a new dreadnought-type battleship was needed. The new ship was Dante Alighieri , and was designed by Rear Admiral Edoardo Masdea . The Italian Navy built five further battleships to two similar designs: the Conte di Cavour and Andrea Doria classes . These six dreadnoughts formed the core of the Italian fleet during World War I , as a further four-ship class was cancelled. Both the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies adopted cautious fleet policies and neither chose to risk their capital ships in a major engagement; as a result, the Italian battle line spent the war in harbor and did not see combat. Nevertheless, the dreadnought Leonardo da Vinci was destroyed by a magazine explosion in August 1916. The pre-dreadnought Benedetto Brin was also destroyed by an internal explosion in September 1915, and her sister Regina Margherita was sunk by a German mine in December 1916. The remaining battleships of the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon and Regina Elena classes were discarded after the end of the war. In the interwar period , the Italian Navy\u2014along with the rest of the major naval powers\u2014was limited by the Washington Naval Treaty , which granted Italy parity with the French Navy. The Italians had 70,000 long tons (71,000\u00a0t) worth of battleship tonnage available for new vessels before they would reach their treaty limits, but they avoided new construction in the 1920s due to severe budgetary problems and to avoid a naval arms race with France. These financial limitations also forced the Italians to scrap Dante Alighieri in 1928. Nevertheless, the Regia Marina decided to make use of its excess tonnage by the early 1930s, which resulted in the four Littorio -class battleships . Two were finished early in World War II and were used extensively to escort convoys during the North African Campaign . The third ship, Roma , was finished in 1942, but was sunk in September 1943 by a German radio-controlled bomb when Italy surrendered to the Allies. The fourth ship, Impero , was never finished and was instead sunk by American bombers and scrapped after the end of the war. The two surviving ships, Littorio and Vittorio Veneto , were surrendered to the Allies and were later broken up for scrap. Of the surviving members of the Conte di Cavour class, Conte di Cavour was scrapped after the end of the war and Giulio Cesare was surrendered to the Soviet Union as war reparations. Only the two Andrea Doria -class battleships survived in Italian service for any significant length of time after the conclusion of hostilities; both served as training ships until the mid-1950s, when they too were broken up for scrap. Pre-dreadnought battleships Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class Ammiraglio di Saint Bon underway Main article: Ammiraglio di Saint Bon -class battleship The first of the Italian Navy's modern battleships, the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class were smaller than their contemporaries due to limitations imposed by the Italian government and indecision in the naval design staff over what kind of battleship should be built. They were designed under the supervision of Admiral Simone di Pacoret Saint Bon , the namesake of the lead ship , and Benedetto Brin . Ultimately, the ships' small size, weak main battery, and slow speed made them ineffective capital ships, since they were not strong enough to engage foreign battleships, and too slow to catch cruisers. Both ships served in the active duty squadron early in their careers, and participated in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911\u20131912. They took part in the Italian offensives in North Africa and the island of Rhodes , but did not see combat with the Ottoman fleet. They were reduced to harbor defense ships by the outbreak of World War I , and spent the war in Venice . The ships were discarded shortly after the end of the war, both having been stricken in 1920. Regina Margherita class Regina Margherita on sea trials in 1904 Main article: Regina Margherita -class battleship The pattern of experimentation in Italian capital ship construction continued with the Regina Margherita class. The negative experience with the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class convinced the constructors, led by Benedetto Brin, to design a larger battleship that could engage its foreign counterparts. The new class was designed specifically to counter the new Habsburg -class battleships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy . For this purpose, the ships were armed with the 12-inch (305\u00a0mm) gun that had become standard for most pre-dreadnought battleships of the day. As was typical for Italian capital ships of the period, armor protection was reduced in order to secure high speed. Brin died during the construction process, and the Italian Navy named the second vessel after him. The two ships also saw action in the Italo-Turkish War, alongside the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class in the 3rd Division of the fleet. Benedetto Brin took part in the attack on Tripoli in October 1911, and both ships were involved in the campaign to seize Rhodes in the eastern Aegean Sea . The Regina Margherita class had become obsolete by the outbreak of World War I and had been reduced to training ships. Both were lost during the war: Benedetto Brin to an internal explosion in Brindisi in September 1915, and Regina Margherita to a German mine in December 1916. Regina Elena class Regina Elena 1907 Main article: Regina Elena -class battleship The final class of Italian pre-dreadnoughts were designed by Vittorio Cuniberti , the naval architect whose projected design for the first \"all-big-gun\" battleship would quickly make the Regina Elena class obsolescent. These ships sacrificed two of the 12-inch guns to obtain a powerful secondary battery of twelve 8-inch (203\u00a0mm) guns. Their high speed\u2014the fastest of any battleship then built, including the revolutionary, turbine -powered HMS\u00a0 Dreadnought \u2014permitted them to also engage cruisers. All four ships served in the 1st Division of the Italian fleet during the Italo-Turkish War, and were the workhorses of the operations off North Africa and in the eastern Mediterranean. During World War I, the ships were primarily based in Brindisi, Taranto , and Valona ; they saw no action during the war due to the cautious fleet policies adopted by both the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies. The ships remained in the Italian fleet for a few years after the war, but all were discarded and broken up for scrap by 1927. Dreadnoughts Dante Alighieri Dante Alighieri at high speed Main article: Italian battleship Dante Alighieri Dante Alighieri was the first dreadnought battleship built by the Italian Navy, and was designed by Rear Admiral Edoardo Masdea . Cuniberti's call for heavy artillery arranged to emphasize broadside fire led to the placement of four triple 12-inch gun turrets along the centerline. This allowed a broadside of all twelve guns, while the first generation of British dreadnoughts could only fire eight of their guns on the broadside. Dante Alighieri was the first battleship to mount her main battery in triple turrets, though the Austro-Hungarian SMS\u00a0 Viribus Unitis was completed first. The ship had a very limited service life. At the outbreak of World War I, she was the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron, based in Taranto. But due to the policy of restraint adopted by the Italian Navy, Dante Alighieri and the other battleships of the Italian fleet saw no action. Financial limitations in the post-war period forced the navy to scrap the ship to reduce the naval budget. The ship was accordingly stricken on 1 July 1928 and sold for scrap. Conte di Cavour class Conte di Cavour as originally built Main article: Conte di Cavour -class battleship The first design in the second generation of Italian dreadnoughts, the Conte di Cavour class was also designed by Edoardo Masdea. They were ordered in response to the French Courbet -class battleships . They remedied many of the deficiencies of the previous design; the most significant improvement was a dramatically more effective arrangement of the main battery. Ten guns were arranged in twin turrets superfiring over triple turrets forward and aft, and a third triple turret was placed amidships . All thirteen guns could fire on the broadside, but the firing arcs for most of the guns were significantly improved. The three ships had limited careers during World War I, and did not see action. On the night of 2/3 August 1916, Leonardo da Vinci was sunk by an internal explosion. She was raised in 1919; the navy planned to repair and modernize her, but lacked sufficient funds, and she was sold in 1923. The two surviving ships were heavily rebuilt in the mid-1930s, and both saw action during World War II . On the night of 11/12 November 1940, both ships were attacked by British torpedo bombers in the Battle of Taranto . Conte di Cavour was badly damaged, and had not been fully repaired when Italy surrendered in September 1943. Giulio Cesare meanwhile escaped unscathed, and participated in the battles of Cape Spartivento and First Sirte in November 1940 and December 1941, respectively. After the end of the war, Conte di Cavour was scrapped, and Giulio Cesare was surrendered to the Soviet Union. Renamed Novorossiysk , she was ultimately sunk in October 1955 by an old German mine left over from World War II. Her wreck was later salvaged in 1957 and broken up thereafter. Andrea Doria class Andrea Doria after her reconstruction in 1937 Main article: Andrea Doria -class battleship Vice Admiral Giuseppe Valsecchi was responsible for the next battleship design, the Andrea Doria class. The class comprised two vessels\u2014 Andrea Doria and Duilio \u2014and the design was based on the previous Conte di Cavour with minor modifications. These two ships were ordered in response to the French Bretagne class . As with the Conte di Cavour s, the two Andrea Doria -class battleships were significantly modernized in the late 1930s along similar lines: the central turret was removed, the propulsion system was completely replaced with more efficient machinery, and the secondary battery was replaced with new turret-mounted guns. The two ships entered service in 1916, and were based in Taranto with the rest of the main fleet for the duration of World War I. Both ships were involved in the Corfu incident in 1923. The ships' modernization work was completed after Italy entered World War II. Duilio was damaged at the Battle of Taranto, while Andrea Doria was not hit. Both ships were present at the First Battle of Sirte, though only Andrea Doria engaged British forces. The two ships survived the war, and were the only battleships the Allies permitted Italy to retain after the conclusion of hostilities. They served in the Italian Navy for another decade until they were discarded in the mid-1950s. Francesco Caracciolo class Line-drawing of the Francesco Caracciolo class Main article: Francesco Caracciolo -class battleship The next Italian battleship design represented a major qualitative step forward. The design was prepared by Rear Admiral Edgardo Ferrati , and was intended to match the latest foreign battleships, such as the British Queen Elizabeth class . The new ships were to be armed with a main battery of eight 15\u00a0in (381\u00a0mm) guns and had a top speed of 28 knots (52\u00a0km/h; 32\u00a0mph), much faster than any contemporary design. The Francesco Caracciolo class was ordered in 1914; the lead ship was laid down that year, and the other three vessels were laid down in 1915. After Italy entered World War I in May 1915, work slowed dramatically, as resources were diverted to more pressing needs. Work on the ships stopped completely by March 1916, and the three ships begun in 1915 were scrapped shortly after the end of the war. In 1919, the Italian Navy considered completing Francesco Caracciolo as an aircraft carrier similar to the British HMS\u00a0 Argus or as a floatplane carrier, but both proposals were too expensive for the cash-strapped navy. Ultimately, she was broken up for scrap in 1926. Littorio class CG rendering of Roma Main article: Littorio -class battleship The final group of Italian battleships was the Littorio class. These ships, which weighed in excess of 40,000 long tons (41,000\u00a0t) standard displacement , violated the naval arms limitation system created by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. The ships were armed with a battery of nine 15-inch guns in three triple turrets, and they incorporated a novel underwater protection system designed by Umberto Pugliese . Littorio and Vittorio Veneto were laid down in 1934 and completed in early 1940; a second pair, Roma and Impero , were laid down in 1938. Roma was finished in mid-1942, while Impero was not completed. The first two ships entered service in August 1940, shortly after Italy joined World War II. Littorio was badly damaged in the November 1940 raid on Taranto, and repairs lasted until March 1941. Vittorio Veneto was undamaged, and later that month took part in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. In March 1941, she was damaged by British torpedo bombers after the Battle of Cape Matapan . Both ships were back in action for the First and Second Battle of Sirte in January and March 1942, respectively. By the end of the year, Roma was ready for service and replaced Littorio as the fleet flagship. After Benito Mussolini fell from power in July 1943, Littorio was renamed Italia . During the Italian surrender in September 1943, Roma was hit by a pair of Fritz-X guided glide bombs; her ammunition magazines blew up in a tremendous explosion and she quickly sank.

{"id": "doc_fixed_127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_I_Never_Knew", "text": "The Jesus I Never Knew is a popular 1995 Christological book by the American Christian author Philip Yancey . It won the Gold Medallion Book Award and ECPA Christian Book of the Year 1996: it is a book that appeals to the wider Christian public for its personal approach to the figure of Jesus , with a fresh and vivid portrayal extracted from a dynamic reading of the four canonical gospels . Synopsis With this book, Yancey intends to offer a new and different perspective on the life of Christ and his work \u2013 his teaching, his miracles , his death and resurrection \u2013 and ultimately, who he was and why he came. The author chronicles his journey of discovery, looking past traditionally perpetuated beliefs about Jesus and reporting facts about him and his teaching as recorded by the authors of the gospels . Juxtaposing the Gospel events with the world we live in today, The Jesus I Never Knew gives a dynamic portrait of this central figure of history. The author examines some of the radical words of Jesus with a willingness to tackle the difficult questions raised by them, and asks whether today Christians are taking them seriously enough. Yancey affirms: \"No one who meets Jesus ever stays the same. In the end I found the process of writing this book to be a great act of faith-strengthening. Jesus has rocked my own preconceptions and has made me ask hard questions about why those of us who bear his name don't do a better job of following him.\" Candidly recalling his own journey of rediscovery of Jesus, Yancey demonstrates to his readers the arc of many Christians' intellectual faith walk. First he addresses possible misconceptions about Jesus physical appearance (probably not tall and gaunt, based on what one knows today of Jews of the time), moves onto his character, and his interactions with people and his disciples. He sincerely questions preconceived notions about who Jesus was and is, drawing from a number of sources including many of Hollywood 's various celluloid representations. Right through the book, Yancey creates what is essentially a prose harmony of the Gospels, reconstructing Jesus life, challenges, and teachings in a fluid and easy language. The text is not academical, but the research is meticulous and diverse, with sections exploring essential questions, whilst others remind the reader of significant details of Jesus' life one may take for granted: \"Distrusting crowds and public opinion, he spent most of his time in towns of small size and little importance\" (p.\u00a092). While Yancey could have speculated about how Jesus' ministry would have been different had it been concentrated in a major metropolis (ultimately irrelevant), his reminder of this detail shines additional light on the wonder that Jesus' ministry became a worldwide phenomenon.

Views on Jesus Jesuism Jews for Jesus Redeemer (Christianity) Lost years of Jesus Related lists List of books about Jesus List of founders of religious traditions List of people claimed to be Jesus List of people who have been considered deities Notes ^ American Christian evangelist Billy Graham , in commenting this book and its author, stated; \"There is no writer in the evangelical world that I admire and appreciate more.\" [1] . ^ Yancey's purpose in presenting this book is to reintroduce readers to Jesus by focusing the reader's attention on Jesus as a man who was born human, lived a fantastic and unpredictable life, taught how to live against the grain, offered paradigm shifts in the understanding of God, loved the simple and despised the self-righteous, and ultimately died to fulfill his mission. Walter Wink sums up the complex, incredible life of Jesus by saying, \"If Jesus had never lived, we would not have been able to invent him.\" Cf. Pt. 1, Ch. 1, pp. 23-25. ^ Cit. int. al., Jesus of Nazareth , The Gospel According to St. Matthew , The King of Kings , Godspell . More than once, Yancey references Jesus' reputation among his contemporaries as \"a wine-bibber and a glutton\" ( Ibid. , p.15, pp.86-87 - cf. Matthew 11:18\u201319 ), which certainly must go against any contemporary Christian's beliefs about Jesus' actions and character. ^ Cf. Ibid . pp.91-96.

Wilson was the first Marine Corps commandant to serve full-time on the Joint Chiefs of Staff . Awards and decorations Wilson was the recipient of the following awards: Medal of Honor citation The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to CAPTAIN LOUIS H. WILSON, JR . UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS for service as set forth in the following CITATION: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as Commanding Officer of Company F, Second Battalion, Ninth Marines, Third Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces at Fonte Hill, Guam, Marianas Islands, 25 and July 26, 1944. Ordered to take that portion of the hill within his zone of action, Captain Wilson initiated his attack in midafternoon, pushed up the rugged, open terrain against terrific machine-gun and rifle fire for 300 yards and successfully captured the objective. Promptly assuming command of other disorganized units and motorized equipment in addition to his own company and one reinforcing platoon, he organized his night defenses in the face of continuous hostile fire and, although wounded three times during this five-hour period, completed his disposition of men and guns before retiring to the company command post for medical attention. Shortly thereafter, when the enemy launched the first of a series of savage counterattacks lasting all night, he voluntarily rejoined his besieged units and repeatedly exposed himself to the merciless hail of shrapnel and bullets, dashing fifty yards into the open on one occasion to rescue a wounded Marine lying helpless beyond the front lines. Fighting fiercely in hand-to-hand encounters , he led his men in furiously waged battle for approximately ten hours, tenaciously holding his line and repelling the fanatically renewed counterthrusts until he succeeded in crushing the last efforts of the hard-pressed Japanese early the following morning. Then, organizing a seventeen-man patrol, he immediately advanced upon a strategic slope essential to the security of his position and, boldly defying intense mortar , machine-gun and rifle fire which struck down thirteen of his men, drove relentlessly forward with the remnants of his patrol to seize the vital ground. By his indomitable leadership, daring combat tactics and dauntless valor in the face of overwhelming odds, Captain Wilson succeeded in capturing and holding the strategic high ground in his regimental sector, thereby contributing essentially to the success of his regimental mission and to the annihilation of 350 Japanese troops. His inspiring conduct throughout the critical periods of this decisive action enhanced and sustained the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service . /S/ HARRY S. TRUMAN Post-military Wilson retired on June 30, 1979, and returned to his home in Mississippi. For \"exceptionally distinguished service\" during his four-year tenure as commandant, and his contributions as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he received the Defense Distinguished Service Medal (first oak leaf cluster ), upon retirement. Wilson died at his home in Birmingham, Alabama , on June 21, 2005. As with all former Marine Corps commandants, in accordance with Article 1288 of Navy Regulations, all ships and stations of the Department of the Navy flew the national flag at half-mast from the time of Wilson's death until sunset of the date of interment.

In 1803 he was appointed to the newly built 74-gun HMS\u00a0 Colossus and afterwards to the 90-gun HMS\u00a0 Barfleur , in which he took part in the Battle of Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805, and later in the blockade of Brest under Admiral William Cornwallis . In November 1808 he was promoted to lieutenant of HMS\u00a0 Dannemark , and served in her at the reduction of Flushing in August 1809. In 1812 he was a lieutenant of the 74-gun HMS\u00a0 Clarence in the Bay of Biscay . Post-war and first commands Glascock afterwards served in a number of frigates on the home station, successively HMS\u00a0 Tiber , HMS\u00a0 Madagascar , and HMS\u00a0 Maeander , and in the 32-gun HMS Sir Francis Drake , flagship of Sir Charles Hamilton on the Newfoundland Station . He was promoted from her to the command of the sloop HMS\u00a0 Carnation in November 1818. In 1819 he commanded the brig HMS\u00a0 Drake , from which he was obliged to resign as an invalid. In 1830 Glascock was appointed to the sloop HMS\u00a0 Orestes , which he commanded on the home station during 1831, but in 1832 he was sent to the coast of Portugal, and during the latter months of the year was stationed in the Douro , for the protection of British interests in the disturbed state of the country during the Liberal Wars . Glascock continued in the Douro, as senior officer, for nearly a year, during which time his conduct under troublesome and often difficult circumstances won for him the approval of the Admiralty and promotion to post-rank, on 3 June 1833, accompanied by a special and complimentary letter from Sir James Graham , the first lord . He did not, however, leave the Douro until the following September, and on 1 October he paid off the Orestes . From April 1843 to January 1847 he commanded the frigate HMS\u00a0 Tyne on the Mediterranean station, and during the following months was employed in Ireland as an inspector under the Poor Relief Act . He died suddenly on 8 October 1847 at Baltinglass . He was married and left children. Writing career Glascock devoted the long intervals of half-pay , both as commander and captain, to writing, and produced several volumes of naval novels, anecdotes, reminiscences, and reflections. His biographer in the Dictionary of National Biography , J. K. Laughton remarked that \"as novels, [they] are stupid enough, and in their historical parts have little value, but are occasionally interesting as social sketches of naval life in the early part of the century.\" Glascock wrote a two-volume work, The Naval Sketch Book, or The Service Afloat and Ashore , published in 1826. This was followed by the three-volume Sailors and Saints, or Matrimonial Man\u0153uvres in 1829, Tales of a Tar, with Characteristic Anecdotes in 1836, and the three-volume Land Sharks and Sea Gulls in 1838. He also wrote a two-volume work entitled Naval Service, or Officers' Manual , published in 1836. This useful manual for young officers passed through four editions in England. The last, published in 1859, had a short advertisement by Glascock's daughter, stating that \"the work has been translated into French, Russian, Swedish, and Turkish, and adopted by the navies of those powers, as well as by that of the United States.\" Laughton remarked that the work was \"of course, quite obsolete, though still interesting to the student of naval history and customs.\" See also O'Byrne, William Richard (1849). \"Glascock, William Nugent\"\u00a0 .

His real name was Franz . A student of Commerce , he moved from Heidelberg to Geneva in 1912, so that he could follow his studies. He would live in Geneva the rest of his life. There he started to work for the World Esperanto Association , of which he had been a member since 1909. In 1934 he resigned from the role of Director , as a form of protest, and started working elsewhere. In the end, he worked in an office of the Swiss federation until he retired. He got married two times, and had a daughter. He was a member of the Swiss Socialist Party . Jakob and Esperanto In 1920 Jakob became the director of the central office of UEA; he cared after the publication of Jarlibroj and after the magazine Esperanto . He became General Director of the World Esperanto Association in 1924; he left the post in 1934, when he resigned, as a form of protest, during the World Esperanto Congress in Stockholm . Since 1936, when the association split into two branches (headquartered respectively in Geneva and London), he began once again to serve as a redactor for the Genevan association. After the reunification of the two associations, in 1947, he joined the governing council of the reborn UEA and started caring after the magazine. In 1955 he resigned from all the posts as a form of protest, but he was nevertheless awarded the title \"honorary redactor\". In 1960 the governing council of UEA learnt that Jakob had been unduly taking some money from the association; a years-long judicial procedure followed suit. When Jakob died, in 1967, UEA inherited part of his money.

His performances as goalkeeper under the leadership of coach Richard P\u00e1ez , and later C\u00e9sar Far\u00edas , for the national team made him an important player in Venezuelan football 's emergent recent history. Club career Venezuela and Europe In 1997, Vega traveled to Italy to play in the youth ranks of Udinese . However, he returned to Venezuela in 1998, joining Nacional T\u00e1chira , a first division club of his country.

In 2006, he was signed by Carabobo , playing 29 games in the club. In 2007, because of his good performances with the national team and his club, he was transferred to Turkish club Bursaspor , being this his second adventure in the old continent. He established himself as the Turkish club's top keeper and appeared in 22 league matches. After his spell at Bursaspor, he joined to Denizlispor , playing only one friendly game for the club.

After five-match unbeaten with him in goal and caretaker coach Luis P\u00e9rez since one-nil over San Felipe (between Torneo Apertura 's regular phase and playoffs), on 24 June, he conceded four goals in rematch semifinal against Universidad de Chile, after having won 2\u20130 in first leg at Macul , where Vega made a well game. International career In 1998, Vega was named the best keeper of the Primera Divisi\u00f3n youth ranks and one year later was listed in the Copa Am\u00e9rica 22\u2013man squad of Venezuela national team by the Argentine coach Jos\u00e9 Omar Pastoriza . He made his international debut on 30 July 1999 against Brazil , in where his team lost 7\u20130, in a match that Ronaldinho realized a very well goal, who made an incredible dribbling that passed over the head of the centre back Jos\u00e9 Manuel Rey . Three seasons later, Renny was called\u2013up by Richard P\u00e1ez to the 2001 Copa Am\u00e9rica held in Colombia , not making an international appearance.

{"id": "doc_fixed_139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchase_Parkway", "text": "The Julian M. Carroll Purchase Parkway was the designation for a 52.3-mile (84.2\u00a0km) freeway in the U.S. state of Kentucky that ran between the Tennessee state line at Fulton and US\u00a062 in Calvert City . It began concurrent with U.S. Route\u00a051 (US 51) only a few yards from an intersection with US\u00a045W , US\u00a045E , and US\u00a045 at its southern terminus. It was one of seven highways that are part of the Kentucky Parkway System . The parkway was upgraded to Interstate Highway standards and incorporated into I-69 in two phases. The northern half between US\u00a045 Bypass in Mayfield and I-24 near Calvert City was redesignated as I-69 in July 2018. The interchange with I-24 was reconstructed from a basic cloverleaf interchange to include a pair of direct high-speed connectors for I-69 through traffic continuing east concurrent with I-24, with the northernmost 1.67 miles (2.69\u00a0km) of the parkway becoming exit\u00a051A-B (unsigned KY\u00a02602 ) and facilitating access to westbound I-24 and US\u00a062 for northbound traffic. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC) acquired and closed the nearby Kentucky Lake Motor Speedway in 2015 via eminent domain for the reconstruction of the interchange. The southern half of the parkway from the Tennessee state line in Fulton to US\u00a045 Bypass in Mayfield was redesignated as I-69 in December 2024. History The Purchase Parkway formerly used a light blue shield. Federal legislation designated the entire length of the Purchase Parkway as I-69 in 2002. On June 6, 2008, President George W. Bush signed HR 1195 (SAFETEA-LU Technical Corrections Act of 2008), reaffirming the I-69 designation for the Purchase Parkway and further authorizing Kentucky to sign the route as such with Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approval. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet had planned I-69 signs on the parkway during the summer of 2008, but the FHWA required the KYTC to either upgrade substandard portions of the route or obtain a design waiver before the parkway could be signed as I-69. On July 6, 2018, a 30-mile segment of the parkway was re-designated as Interstate 69, and the parkway was truncated to exit 21 in Mayfield The northernmost stub of the Purchase Parkway between I-24/I-69 and US-62 (now unsigned KY\u00a02602 ) is now signed as \"TO US-62\" in the northbound direction and \"TO I-24/I-69\" in the southbound direction. Originally named Purchase Parkway for the Jackson Purchase area it diagonally traverses, the road was renamed for Julian Carroll , a former Kentucky governor from McCracken County , in 2001. The Purchase Parkway carried the unsigned designation of Kentucky Route 9003 ( JC 9003 ). The Mayfield Bypass, which was incorporated into the parkway following its construction, is also signed as US\u00a045 Bypass . Transition to Interstate 69 The Julian M. Carroll Purchase Parkway from the junction with Interstate 24 west was legally designated to become part of I-69 . On May 15, 2006, Governor Ernie Fletcher announced that the Purchase Parkway would become part of the alignment of I-69 in Kentucky, along with parts of I-24, the Edward T. Breathitt Pennyrile Parkway , and the Wendell H. Ford Western Kentucky Parkway . To reflect this, Future I-69 shields were erected along the parkway in the middle of 2006. Additional federal legislation enacted in 2008 confirmed the route of I-69, and authorized Kentucky to immediately begin signing the Purchase Parkway (and parts of the Western Kentucky Parkway and Pennyrile Parkway ) as I-69, even though the parkways did not yet meet Interstate Highway standards . The reason the 2008 legislation (HR 1195) immediately applied the I-69 designation to the Purchase Parkway was to tap into federal Interstate Highway money to fund upgrades to the parkway. This is because Interstate Highway funds typically could not be used to upgrade an existing freeway until it is designated and signed as an Interstate. Median improvements near Mayfield , increased bridge heights to 16 feet (4.9\u00a0m), shoulder improvements, and interchange reconstructions will all need to take place to bring the alignment into federal compliance. No official funding has been set in the six-year plan stipulating modernization of the parkways that will be affected by I-69's routing, nor has any official study been completed. As a toll road Except for the Mayfield bypass, which remained free, the parkway was originally a toll road , as were all Kentucky parkways. State law requires that toll collection cease when enough tolls are collected to pay off the parkway's construction bonds; which in the case of the Purchase, occurred in 1992.

The family's branches are descended from John Ames, the son of a 17th-century settler of the Province of Massachusetts Bay . Numerous public and private works throughout the U.S. are named after family members, including the city Ames, Iowa , and the NASA Ames research center in California. Origins The scion of the American Ames family was William Ames, who was born in England to John Ames and Cyprian Ames (n\u00e9e Brown) in 1605. The family's earliest known ancestor died in 1560. It is thought the family's surname was, at some point prior to emigration, changed from Amyas . In the 16th century Amyas was frequently confused with Ames. William Ames immigrated to Massachusetts Bay in 1638, eventually settled in Braintree , and died in about 1653. With his wife Hannah, he had one son, John, born in 1647.

{"id": "doc_fixed_141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perizzites", "text": "The Perizzites ( Hebrew : \u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b4\u05d6\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9 , romanized :\u00a0 P\u0259rizzi ) are a group of people mentioned many times in the Hebrew Bible as having lived in the land of Canaan before the arrival of the Israelites. The name may be related to a Hebrew term meaning \"rural person.\" History Biblical mentions of Perizzites extend from the time of Abraham (Genesis 13:7) to the time of Ezra and Nehemiah ( Ezra 9 :1\u20132). According to Michael LeFebvre, Ezra's reference to the Perizzites does not imply that a group still known as Perizzites existed in the land in Ezra's time. It is instead to be understood as a literary reference by Ezra to passages such as Exodus 34:11\u201316, Exodus 33:2 and Deuteronomy 7:1\u20135, which prohibited intermarriage with a variety of non-Israelite peoples, including Perizzites, among others. The time during which Perizzites were most in conflict with the Israelites seems to be the time of Joshua into the early period of the Judges. According to the Book of Joshua , the Perizzites were in the hill country of Judah and Ephraim (Joshua 11:3, 17:14\u201315). According to 1 Kings 9:21, they were servants to Solomon . According to Hittitologist Trevor R. Bryce , \"The Perizzites cannot be linked to any peoples or lands known from extra-biblical sources,\" but there are speculative links to the Hivites and the Jebusites , who may have originated from a region called Que in Assyrian sources or Kue/Quoah in biblical sources. Jewish Encyclopedia entry Canaanitic tribes settled in the south of Canaan between Hor and Negeb, although it is not mentioned in the genealogy in Gen. x. According to the Biblical references, Abraham, when he entered Canaan, found the Perizzites dwelling near the Canaanites (ib. xiii. 7), and God promised to destroy both these peoples (ib. xv. 20). Jacob reproved his sons because of the crime of Shechem, inasmuch as he feared the Perizzites and the Canaanites (ib. xxxiv. 30). Moses promised the Israelites to bring them unto the place of the Perizzites and the Amorites (Ex. xxx. 8); and at a later time the tribes of Simeon and Judah conquered the Canaanites and the Perizzites (Judges i. 4). The Perizzites were among the tribes that were not subjected to tribute by Solomon (I Kings ix. 20\u201322), while the complaint was brought to Ezra that the priests and the Levites would not separate themselves from the Perizzites and the other peoples of the land (Ezra ix. 1). The view was formerly held that the Perizzites were a prehistoric tribe which became assimilated to the Canaanites when the latter invaded Canaan; but this is in contradiction to the fact that the Perizzites are not mentioned in the genealogy. More recent commentators are of the opinion that the names \"Perizi\" and \"Perazi\" are identical, and that the Bible has included under the name \"Perizzites\" all stocks dwelling in unwalled towns.

{"id": "doc_fixed_145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondo_(putty)", "text": "Bondo is a polyester putty product originally marketed as an automotive body filler. Nowadays the brand name is used by 3M for a line of American-made products for automotive, marine and household repairs. The term Bondo is trademarked by 3M, but is commonly used to refer to any brand of automotive repair putty due to its popularity. It is also used by sculptors . History Before the 1950s, body solder was often used to repair large imperfections prior to painting in both new cars and vehicle repair shops. Solder repairs were conducted using a flame and wooden paddles covered in tallow or motor oil, which prevented the half-molten lead from sticking. After World War II , automotive panels became thinner and larger, with a greater susceptibility to warping, making hot solder unsuitable. The earliest 'plastic solder' can be traced to around 1940, a do-it-yourself solution to panel beating. This gave the consumer the ability to attempt reasonably priced and long lasting repairs. These early fillers were epoxy -based and one-part, drying by outgassing. Originally, the plastic fillers performed badly compared to solder, but later improvements addressed this. Bondo, a two-part mix ( resin with hardener added) of talc and plastic, was introduced in 1955. It was developed by WWII veteran and automotive repair shop owner Robert Merton Spink of Miami , Florida . Bondo was acquired by 3M in 2007.

{"id": "doc_fixed_147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencers_Building", "text": "Spencers Building is a pair of heritage-listed warehouses at 45\u201347 and 49\u201351 Edward Street , Brisbane City , City of Brisbane , Queensland , Australia. It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built from 1889 to 1890 by Thomas Rees . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 August 1993. History Spencers Building (left) during the 1890 flood with \"To Let\" sign The land at the site occupies part of allotments 4 and 5 of section 35 which were acquired respectively by James Donald in 1852 and the well-known Benjamin Cribb in 1854. Cribb and Donald cooperated in the subdivision and resubdivision of the allotments with the land under study passing to William Hood in 1876. Hood was a principal of the firm Hood & Binnie whose iron foundry works were located at the site until 1888. In that year title to the land passed to Frances Sophia Jones wife of the Anglican clergyman Rev Thomas Jones who had accompanied Brisbane 's first Anglican Bishop, Edward Tufnell on his arrival in 1860. It was unusual in those times for a married woman to have sole title to this kind of property, but Frances Jones probably did not have ultimate control over it. Until the Married Women's Property Act was introduced in Queensland in 1890, a husband was entitled to the income from such a property and could mortgage it without his wife's consent \u2013 unless her family had secured it to her through a trust. By May 1889 Frances Jones had mortgaged the property to a total of \u00a35000, presumably to finance the erection of the building which Thomas Rees undertook during the year; FDG Stanley, former Queensland Colonial Architect , was the designer. Rees had also built the adjacent warehouse ( South East Queensland Water Board Building ) several years earlier. The building was completed by early 1890 and in February Benjamin Brothers Ltd occupied the western section (Nos 49\u201351) \u2013 using it as a bulk store. The building was flooded in the March 1890 floods and a photo taken at the time shows a \"To Let\" sign advertising the eastern section. The leasing agent was the Queensland Trustees Executors Agency Co (QTEA), presumably acting for Frances Sophia Jones. Benjamin Brothers bulk store during the 1893 flood Two floods (1890 and 1893 Brisbane flood ), low occupancy rates and a severely depressed economy no doubt contributed to the repossession of the building in 1894. In the same year, QTEA was struck off the companies register. The vacancy rates of the 1890s were relieved somewhat around the turn of the century with the first of a series of long-term tenancies. Leonard Spencer, coach builder and ironmonger, began a twenty-odd year occupancy of Nos 45\u201347 in 1903. Another enduring tenancy, that of Roche & Dahl leather merchants (Nos 49\u201351), began in 1911. In 1913, ownership of the property was transferred to James Milne and James Raff of the machinery firm Smellie & Co, whose two business premises ( Smellie's Building and Old Mineral House ) were nearby. In the late 1920s or early 1930s, Leonard Spencer built his own building, Spencer Chambers, at 53 Edward Street and moved out of Nos 45\u201347. His place was taken by John Mitchell Hamilton, a tent manufacturer who eventually bought the entire building, with his son, in 1941. In the mid-1940s Jolly & Batchelor carried on the leather tradition at the building, buying out Roche & Dahl and moving into their premises. For many years, Jolly & Batchelor operated their business there; in 1964 they left the central city area for South Brisbane where they continue to provide materials and equipment to the leather trade and to the public. Another Spencer, a typewriter dealer, bought Nos 45\u201347 in 1978, but sold them to the present owners in 1987. The present owners of Nos 47\u201351 acquired the property in 1965. By 2014, Nos 45\u201347 had been unoccupied for several years and were sold in September 2014 (needing refurbishment). Description This Victorian warehouse has austere classical detailing in both rendered and unrendered brickwork. The building consists of four storeys and a basement level and is divided into two identical portions. The upper three floors of each portion are separated by a string course. The ground floor has tall arched openings surrounded by render that imitates rusticated stonework. Above each centre bay at the street level is a simple triangular classical pediment. The three upper levels are unrendered brick. Windows on these levels are separated by projecting brick pilasters . The windows on the two middle levels have arched heads and those on the upper level have curved pediments . Paired moulded brackets support the cornice line at the upper level. Above this the parapet has plain triangular pediments located over each central bay. The engaged brick piers at the sides and in the centre of the building continue the rusticated theme of the rendered base by having seven fielded plaster panels regularly distributed along the height of the pier on each level. Both rendered and unrendered portions of the building have been altered with the use of aluminium shopfronting at street level, moving the entry into a side bay, and a cantilevered awning . Some of the other windows have also been modified with the use of aluminium-framed glazing. The face brickwork has been painted, eliminating the original distinction between the upper three levels and the rendered street-level facade. At the rear, the face brick remains unpainted, and the two portions are distinguished by separate gable ends with central loading gantries. A modern steel fire stair serves both sections of the building.

{"id": "doc_fixed_149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_So_Bright", "text": "World So Bright is the debut album by the American musician Adam Schmitt , released in 1991. Schmitt supported the album by opening for the BoDeans on a North American tour. Production Recorded at Chicago Recording Company and in Schmitt's Champaign, Illinois , basement, the album was produced by Greg Edward and Schmitt. It contains contributions from Lisa Germano , Kenny Aronoff , John Richardson , and Jay Bennett . \"Scarlet Street\" addresses the problem of homelessness in the United States. Critical reception Trouser Press thought that the \"well-crafted songs are mega-tuneful guitar-driven gems with hooks galore and lyrics that rise above the prosaic 'boy meets girl/boy loses girl/boy misses girl/boy goes looking for another girl' fodder.\" The Chicago Tribune determined that \"the album's dozen songs resound with the innate humability that informs the best work of Squeeze, XTC and the dB's.\" The Palm Beach Post wrote: \"A hopeful romantic, [Schmitt] infuses love song after love song with memorable hooks. A tough, heartfelt delivery gives them an added edge.\" The Republican concluded that \"it's pop alright, but the hooks don't hook and the thing don't swing.\" Rolling Stone called it \"more than a promising debut, it's a confident piece of work from a canny singer-songwriter who's going to be around for a good long while.\" AllMusic wrote that \"things are less impressive when the amps get cranked too high ('River Black'), but fortunately that's not a frequent mistake, and one that's more than redeemed by songs like the wistful, touching ballad 'Elizabeth Einstein'.\" MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide deemed the album \"a flawless disc,\" writing that the title track is a \"symmetrical diamond.\" In 2001, Goldmine labeled World So Bright \"a pop manifesto to the max, brimming with catchy tunes delivered in a classic pop style.\" Track listing All tracks are written by Adam Schmitt.

Its leaves are egg-shaped to trowel-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, 10\u201355\u00a0mm (0.39\u20132.17\u00a0in) long and 3\u201325\u00a0mm (0.12\u20130.98\u00a0in) wide on a short petiole , with 3 to 7 sharply-pointed lobes. The flowers are arranged in down-turned clusters, more or less on one side of a rachis 15\u201350\u00a0mm (0.59\u20131.97\u00a0in) long, the flowers nearer the base of the rachis flowering first, each flower on a pedicel 2.5\u20133.5\u00a0mm (0.098\u20130.138\u00a0in) long. The flowers are red with a yellow-tipped style, the pistil 25\u201328\u00a0mm (0.98\u20131.10\u00a0in) long. Flowering mainly occurs from June to October, and the fruit is a glabrous , ridged, oval follicle 12\u201316\u00a0mm (0.47\u20130.63\u00a0in) long. Taxonomy Grevillea variifolia was first formally described in 1963 by Charles Austin Gardner and Alex George in the Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia from specimens collected by George in the Cape Range in 1961. The specific epithet ( variifolia ) means \"varying-leaved\". In 1998, Greg Keighery described two subspecies of G.\u00a0variifolia in the journal Nuytsia , and the names are accepted by the Australian Plant Census : Grevillea variifolia subsp. bundera Keighery has mature leaves with a petiole about 2\u00a0mm (0.079\u00a0in) long, the leaves usually triangular 11\u201315\u00a0mm (0.43\u20130.59\u00a0in) long and up to 5\u00a0mm (0.20\u00a0in) wide with up to 5 sharply-pointed lobes. Grevillea variifolia C.A.Gardner & A.S.George subsp. varifolia has mature leaves with a petiole 3\u20136\u00a0mm (0.12\u20130.24\u00a0in) long, the leaves usually lance-shaped to wedge-shaped, 17\u201343\u00a0mm (0.67\u20131.69\u00a0in) long and 15\u201322\u00a0mm (0.59\u20130.87\u00a0in) wide with up to 3 to 7 lobes that are rarely sharply pointed. Distribution and habitat Cape Range grevillea grows in open shrubland, subsp. bundera between Cape Cuvier and the Rough Range (inland from Ningaloo ), and subsp. variifolia in the northern part of North West Cape .

History Under the ancien r\u00e9gime , the consuls originally rented a room for their meetings. This arrangement continued until July 1374, when a former consul, Perrot de Verdun, bequeathed his house on the south side of Rue de l'Armillerie to the town for the purposes of establishing a municipal office, to be known as the Maison Commune. The pediment above the door was inscribed \"Romans se gouverne par ses bonnes mani\u00e8res et ses hons citoyens\" (\"Romans governs itself by its good manners and its honorable citizens\"). The building was restored in 1499, in 1562, in 1567 and in 1756. After it was no longer required for municipal use, it was sold to a private purchaser. It then served successively as a performance hall, as a private residence and then as a military barracks, before being demolished to allow the expansion of an adjacent street in 1895. Following the French Revolution , the new town council decided to acquire a more substantial building for municipal use. The building they selected, on the north side of what is now Place Jules Nadi, was the Couvent des Cordeliers ( Convent of the Cordeliers ). The convent was established by Aymar VI de Poitiers in June 1252 and was subsequently managed by the Franciscans . It was sacked by the Huguenots in 1562 and then burned down by them in 1567 during the French Wars of Religion . After the convent was confiscated by the state as biens nationaux (for the good of the state), the monks were driven out and it was acquired by the council in 1790. Although the council initially agreed to meet in part of the former convent, the building was too dilapidated for long term use and, in the late 18th century, the council decided to demolish it and to erect a new building on the same site. The new building was designed in the neoclassical style , built in ashlar stone and was completed in 1802. It was modified in the mid-19th century. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of 16 bays facing onto what is now Place Jules Nadi. It was laid out with a central section of two bays, two wings of four bays each and, beyond that, two pavilions of three bays each. The central section and the wings were three storeys high, while the pavilions were four storeys high. The central section featured two doorways with triangular pediments on the ground floor, two French doors and a balustraded balcony on the first floor, and two casement windows on the second floor. The central bay was flanked by banded pilasters supporting an open pediment with a coat of arms in the tympanum . The other bays were fenestrated by casement windows with moulded surrounds. The pavilions were flanked by banded pilasters supporting cornices and pyramid -shaped roofs. Internally, the principal room was the Salle du Conseil (council chamber). On 22 August 1944, during the Second World War , troops of the 12th Cuirassier Regiment together with elements of the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans entered the town and seized the town hall. The council chamber was refurnished with fine woodwork recovered from a former clothing store owned by Parfait Lanaz on Place Jacquemart (now Place Charles de Gaulle) in March 1954. The woodwork was restored by Vallon Faure and the seating reupholstered by Global Concept in 2021. References ^ \"La Rue de l'Armillerie \u00e0 Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re\" .

{"id": "doc_fixed_168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southie_(film)", "text": "Southie is a 1999 American crime thriller film directed by John Shea starring Donnie Wahlberg . It also stars Rose McGowan , Anne Meara , Jimmy Cummings , Lawrence Tierney , Robert Wahlberg , Will Arnett , Shea, and Amanda Peet . The film centers around Danny Quinn, a former \"street kid\" from South Boston , returning home to find his family deeper into organized crime than when he left, and his struggles not to fall back into his previous life. Plot Danny Quinn ( Donnie Wahlberg ) is a former \"street kid\" from South Boston , colloquially known as \"Southie,\" who returns home from New York City after three years away. He finds his mother ( Anne Meara ) overwhelmed with worry as her other three kids are caught up in the madness of the hardscrabble neighborhood in which drinking, sex, and fighting is the way of life. Danny tracks down his brothers only to find out they are deeply embedded in the Irish mob in Boston and in debt to local mobster Colie Powers ( Lawrence Tierney ). His younger sister Kathy ( Rose McGowan ), meanwhile, became a barfly in Danny's absence. Danny must get his hands on some quick cash in order to stop his brothers from getting their legs broken and his sister off the streets. In his pursuit to help his ailing mother and right his family's name on the streets of Southie, Danny tracks down his old girlfriend from the neighborhood, Marianne ( Amanda Peet ), finding that the love he left behind still remains. She tells how she heard about the gunfight he was in with Joey Ward ( Jimmy Cummings ) and wants to know if that is why he left town. Danny confesses that real reason he left town was that he needed to stop drinking if he were to become the man that she would want him to be. Unable to find legitimate work and banned from union jobs due to a scuffle at a wedding, Danny becomes desperate for money. Two of his old pals know Danny needs money and offer him an opportunity to be a partner in an underground gambling club, though, they neglect to tell Danny that their silent partner is his old nemesis, Joey Ward. It does not take long before Danny finds out and he and Joey are face to face. In Danny's absence from the neighborhood, Joey's father Butchie has declared war on Colie Powers and without knowing this Danny finds himself caught up in the middle of their war as it looks like he is in business with the Wards. The mob war eventually comes to Danny's front door, and the stress of an attempted murder in front of his house kills Danny's mother. Cast Donnie Wahlberg as Danny Quinn Rose McGowan as Kathy Quinn Robert Wahlberg as Davy Quinn Steven Kozlowski as Jimmy Quinn Anne Meara as Mrs. Quinn Lawrence Tierney as Colm 'Colie' Powers John Shea as Peter Binda David Fitzgerald as Francis 'Butchie' Ward Jimmy Cummings as Joey Ward Brian Goodman as Mikey 'Monk' Moriarty Lenny Clarke as Eddie 'Fat Eddie' Will Arnett as 'Whitey' Amanda Peet as Marianne Silva Janet Giannone as Peggy Silva Jere Shea as Martin Powers Katie MacIntosh as Clare Powers Josh Marchette as Will Casey Mannie Corrado as Jackie Porter Jeffery Cook as Chuckie Boyle Jay Giannone as Teddy Mac Mary Flavin as Desiree Sue Costello as Maureen 'Mo' Maloney Steve Sweeney as Paul Finnerty Production Southie was written by two young screenwriters from Boston, Jimmy Cummings and Dave McLaughlin. It was originally entitled \"Brass Ring\". The lead role was originally offered to Mark Wahlberg but he was not available following the success of the 1997 film Boogie Nights . Cummings' younger brother, Dan, suggested Donnie Wahlberg for the leading role. Shea spent a day with Ron Howard in New York as Howard completed the sound mixing on the 1996 film Ransom , in which Wahlberg had a supporting role. Shea liked what he saw and Wahlberg was offered the role. Shooting was scheduled for February 1997, in the middle of a very cold and brutal Boston winter. The film was shot with a full union crew in twenty-four days. The film ends as the real St. Patrick's Day parade goes through South Boston. The filmmakers were given permission by Thomas Menino , the Mayor of Boston , to shoot the parade. Directors of photography Allen Baker and Michael Bulter used five 35mm cameras to capture the Southie neighborhood. After almost a year of post-production editing and scoring by composer Wayne Sharp , the filmmakers changed the film's name to Southie at the suggestion of Donnie Wahlberg. It was the first feature film ever shot entirely in the old South Boston neighborhood, a place once described as \"the last white ghetto in America\". Release Southie was entered into the Seattle International Film Festival , the Nantucket Film Festival and the American Film Institute Festival in Los Angeles. The movie was acquired for distribution by Lions Gate Pictures after its screening at the Montreal World Film Festival where it was the only American film representing the United States in the main competition. In April 1999, it played at the 14th Dublin Film Festival .

Its beliefs remained similar to Seventh-day Adventists. At its peak in the 1930s the movement had 15 congregations and smaller \"missions\" throughout the United States and Jamaica .

{"id": "doc_fixed_173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urachus", "text": "Not to be confused with Vitelline duct . The urachus forms from the distal end of the allantois in the embryo , and develops into a closed cord between the base of the bladder , and the navel . It drains the bladder of the fetus that joins and runs within the umbilical cord . The fibrous remnant lies in the space of Retzius , between the transverse fascia anteriorly and the peritoneum posteriorly. At birth, the urachus develops into the median umbilical ligament . Development The part of the urogenital sinus related to the bladder and urethra absorbs the ends of the Wolffian ducts and the associated ends of the renal diverticula . This gives rise to the trigone of the bladder and part of the prostatic urethra . The remainder of this part of the urogenital sinus forms the body of the bladder and part of the prostatic urethra. The apex of the bladder stretches and is connected to the umbilicus as a narrow canal. This canal is initially open, but later closes as the urachus goes on to definitively form the median umbilical ligament . Clinical significance Failure of the inside of the urachus to be filled in leaves the urachus open. The telltale sign is leakage of urine through the umbilicus. This is often managed surgically. There are four anatomical causes: Urachal cyst : there is no longer a connection between the bladder and the umbilicus, however a fluid filled cavity with uroepithelium lining persists between these two structures. Urachal fistula : there is free communication between the bladder and umbilicus Urachal diverticulum (vesicourachal diverticulum): the bladder exhibits outpouching Urachal sinus : the pouch opens toward the umbilicus The urachus is also subject to neoplasia. Urachal adenocarcinoma is histologically similar to adenocarcinoma of the bowel. Rarely, urachus carcinomas can metastasise to other regions of the body, including pelvic bones and the lung. One urachal mass has been reported that was found to be a manifestation of IgG4-related disease .

Early life and education She was born in 1923 in a Christian family in An\u00e9ho , a town in southeastern Togo's Maritime region , the spiritual center of the Guin-Mina people . Her brother, Jean Kuassi Gbikpi, would later become archbishop of Lom\u00e9. After beginning her primary studies in An\u00e9ho, she graduated in Porto-Novo , Benin . She then attended the Cours Compl\u00e9mentaire in Lom\u00e9. Career as civil servant Sivomey was hired by the French colonial administration as a civil servant, working in the Finance Department from 1940 to 1945. She continued this Finance Department work under the framework of French West Africa from 1945 until 1953, including in the Direct Tax Department of the city of Bobo-Dioulasso , in what is now Burkina Faso . She returned permanently to Togo, which gained independence from France in 1960, and supported the leadership of the country's Direct Tax Department from 1960 to 1962. She then worked as chief administrative secretary and then director of social affairs starting in 1963. At the same time, she represented Togo at various symposiums and congresses, and in 1961 she became the first Togolese woman to participate in a session of the United Nations General Assembly . It was in this period that she also helped organize L'Union des Femmes du Togo (UFEMTO), the Union of Togolese Women, alongside Marguerite Adjoavi Thompson-Tr\u00e9nou and other women activists. Mayor of Lom\u00e9 Following the January 1967 Togolese coup d'\u00e9tat and the ascent to power of President Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma , all the country's elected bodies were dissolved, political parties were banned, and the administration of Togo's communes fell to d\u00e9l\u00e9gations sp\u00e9ciales , or special delegations. In this fraught context, Marie Mado\u00e9 Sivomey was designated mayor of Lom\u00e9 on July 24, 1967, based on her extensive experience as a civil servant. \"Among the potential candidates for the post of mayor, I was the most experienced in the workings of the administration, having previously overseen social services,\" she later said. She held the position until May 17, 1974. Later years In her retirement, Sivomey lived in Lom-Nava. She was heavily involved in her local parish, as a deeply religious woman who was at times criticized by the country's youth for her moralizing stances. She also continued to advocate on behalf of Togolese women, particularly in support of women's education. She died on September 15, 2008, in Lom\u00e9.

{"id": "doc_fixed_181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_of_matter", "text": "In United States patent law , a composition of matter is one of the four principal categories of things that may be patented. The other three are a process (also termed a method ), a machine , and an article of manufacture . In United States patent law, that same terminology has been in use since the first patent act in 1790 (with the exception that processes were formerly termed \"arts\"). The United States Supreme Court has defined \"composition of matter\" to mean \"all compositions of two or more substances and all composite articles, whether they be the results of chemical union, or of mechanical mixture, or whether they be gases, fluids, powders or solids.\" That definition is problematic, however, because composite articles can be articles of manufacture\u2014as in the case of a piece of plywood, a concrete sidewalk, a road, a fibreglass bathtub, a (kitchen) countertop, or a flitch beam . Robinson on Patents has defined \"composition of matter\" in these terms: A composition of matter is an instrument formed by the intermixture of two or more ingredients, and possessing properties which belong to none of these ingredients in their separate state. ...The intermixture of ingredients in a composition of matter may be produced by mechanical or chemical operations, and its result may be a compound substance resolvable into its constituent elements by mechanical processes, or a new substance which can be destroyed only by chemical analysis. A newly synthesized chemical compound or molecule may be patented as a composition of matter. Patents have been allowed on transitory products, such as short-lived chemical intermediates. Living things as compositions of matter In Diamond v. Chakrabarty , the United States Supreme Court held that a genetically-altered living microorganism was patent-eligible subject matter. The Chakrabarty Court said that \"we must determine whether respondent's micro-organism constitutes a 'manufacture' or 'composition of matter' within the meaning of the statute. The Court's answer to its question was yes----\"respondent's micro-organism plainly qualifies as patentable subject matter.\" But the Court never said which one it was. The oncomouse Main article: Oncomouse In 1988, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted U.S. patent 4,736,866 (filed Jun 22, 1984, issued Apr 12, 1988, expired April 12, 2005) to Harvard College claiming a mouse (the \"oncomouse\") as \u201ca transgenic non-human mammal whose germ cells and somatic cells contain a re-combinant activated oncogene sequence introduced into said mammal\u2026\u201d The European Patent Office (EPO) concluded that the usefulness of the oncomouse in furthering cancer research satisfied the likelihood of substantial medical benefit, and outweighed moral concerns about suffering caused to the animal. In the original application, the claims referred to animals in general, but in the course of the proceedings, the patent was amended and finally maintained with claims limited to mice. The oncomouse has been patented in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. After extended litigation, in 2000, a Canadian court permitted issuance of a patent on a mouse as a \"composition of matter.\" However, in 2002, the Canadian Supreme Court reversed that ruling and held (5-4) that the mouse itself could not be patented, but the biochemical process used to modify it could be.

I have represented England and the UK as an amateur, and they were the greatest times of my life, part of me wants to go to the Olympics still, but I'm positive now is the time, and I can go on to better my amateur achievements as a pro\u201d . His first fight was 3 months later when he defeated journeyman Delroy Spencer at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton . In June 2008 he fought in his home city of Birmingham for the first time beating Frenchman Alain Bonnel on points over six rounds. it was also the first time he had fought in the whole of 2008 following a string of cancelled bouts. Commonwealth Champion Despite not fighting regularly in 2008, Broadhurst still managed to win his first professional title in October. Fighting in his home town of Birmingham once more he headlined a bill that saw him win the vacant Commonwealth super flyweight crown. The opponent in the other corner was Isaac Quaye of Ghana with Broadhurst winning a unanimous decision over 12 rounds. The win meant that he had now won the Commonwealth title as an amateur and as a professional. Despite this fact the bill itself at the Aston Villa Leisure Centre will no doubt be more remembered for Broadhurst's compatriot Peter Buckley , the journeyman , winning in his 300th and last bout. Broadhurst made the first defence of his title in March 2009 at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham defeating another boxer from Ghana, Isaac Owusu in the 11th round. On 24 April Broadhurst fought his third Ghanain boxer in a row with a 6th round stoppage of Asamoah Wilson for his second title defence. Unification bout with Haskins On 11 December 2009 after 11 straight wins and two defences of his belt Broadhurst lost to reigning British super flyweight champion Lee Haskins in a unification clash. The fight, in Newport Wales, saw Haskins become a double champion after scoring a unanimous decision over 12 scrappy rounds. Speaking of his disappointment at having lost for the first time Broadhurst claimed that it was \"one bad night\" told Boxing News \"I just stayed in my bed, depressed. It was one of the worst things that has ever happened to me, it was like a family member had died or something \u2013 that is how bad it was\". Defeat to Ali Broadhurst didn't return to the ring until 18 September 2010 when he hoped that an appearance on Frank Warrens 'Magnificent Seven' event held at the LG Arena in Birmingham would re-ignite his career. It was not to be however as he lost for the second time in a row, this time to Najah Ali a fighter who had fought only five professional contests. The contest was fought at bantamweight which was above Broadhursts natural weight but the loss to Ali by two rounds was bitterly disappointing for the local man.

The club's greatest success has been to earn promotion to the tier four Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest in 2022. History Former crest of TSV Lehnerz The club was formed on 2 December 1965 as Turn- und Sportverein Lehnerz and joined competitive football a year later, in 1966. The first three decades of its history the club spent as a non-descript amateur side in local football. TSV for the first time moved up into the higher levels of Hesse football in 1997 when it won promotion to the tier five Landesliga Hessen-Nord , rebranded the Verbandsliga in 2009. Lehnerz would play the next sixteen seasons at this level, generally achieving good results and finishing in the upper half of the table. It finished runners-up in 2007 and, again in 2012 but failed to win promotion on each occasion. The 2012\u201313 season proved to be the most successful for the club, winning its Verbandsliga division and thereby direct promotion to the tier five Hessenliga . In its first season in the Hessenliga the club finished in fourth place. In 2014\u201315 the club finished runners-up in the league and thereby earned the right to take part in the promotion round to the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest . After two draws the club missed out on promotion with Bahlinger SC promoted instead. In April 2018, TSV acquired the men's first team of Borussia Fulda , which resigned from the Hessenliga, but remained as an association and continued to provide youth teams. The club was renamed SG Barockstadt Fulda-Lehnerz and received a new logo and new club colours. With the addition of the name Barockstadt , the connection to the city of Fulda has been emphasised. On 1 July, all these became official. Honours The club's honours: Verbandsliga Hessen-Nord Champions: 2013 Runners-up: 2007, 2012 Bezirksoberliga Fulda Champions: 1997 Players As of 15 September 2025 Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules ; some limited exceptions apply.

He is best known for his 1674 defense of Martinique against Dutch forces under Admiral Michiel de Ruyter , where he was captain of a warship that played a critical role in driving the Dutch land forces off their beachhead. Early years (1642\u201374) Thomas Claude Renart de Fuchsamberg was born on 21 March 1642 in Mouzon , Province of Champagne. He came from a Saxon family that had settled in Mouzon. His father was Nicolas Renart, sieur des Mahomets. His mother, born Marin, was dame d'Amblimont. His father died in the siege of Mouzon in 1653. When his older brother died in the Battle of Valenciennes (1656) he inherited the seigneury of Amblimont, near Mouzon. Amblimont obtained a position as captain in the regiment of Jean-Armand de Joyeuse, Marquis de Grandpr\u00e9 . He joined that regiment on 20 September 1656. In November 1663 Amblimont transferred to the navy as lieutenant de vaisseau . In 1669 he was capitaine de vaisseau in Rochefort, Charente-Maritime . That year he participated in the Cretan War as aide-de-camp of Almeiras. Defense of Martinique (1674) The Third Anglo-Dutch War was launched by the English and French in 1672, but the allies were outmatched by the Dutch forces under Admiral Michiel de Ruyter , who inflicted several defeats. After the English had withdrawn from their alliance with France, de Ruyter appeared off Martinique on 16 July 1674 with a fleet that included 18 warships, support vessels and 15 troop transports with 3,400 soldiers. The French were expecting de Ruyter but thought Fort Royal (now Fort-de-France ) was impregnable, so had concentrated their forces up the coast at Saint-Pierre . De Ruyter directed his force to Fort Royal, but was becalmed on the first day, giving the French time for urgent efforts to improve the defenses. Dutch assault on Fort-Royal, 1674 The governor of Martinique Antoine Andr\u00e9 de Sainte-Marthe arrived to take command at dawn, by which time the French had booms across the harbour mouth and enough men to work the batteries. Two armed ship were anchored off the fort: the 44-gun royal frigate Jeux under Amblimont and the 22-gun merchantman Saint Eustache . At the start of the attempted Invasion of Martinique de Ruyter's force was greeted by heavy gunfire when it entered the harbour in the morning on 20 July. 1,000 Dutch troops were landed at 9:00\u00a0a.m. but found themselves trapped below high cliffs, exposed to fire from the French batteries and from the two armed ships. They broke into a rum warehouse and all discipline was lost. The commanders of the Dutch land forces tried to take shelter below a cliff, but Amblimont at once landed six guns from the Jeux and opened fire on the new position. Dutch morale collapsed when their commander Van Uyttenhowe was badly wounded. The Dutch troops escaped by boat around 1:00\u00a0a.m., made a second assault at 2:00\u00a0p.m., and again were forced to retreat. The Dutch had lost 143 dead and 318 wounded against 15 French dead. They abandoned the effort, sailed north that night, and eventually returned to Europe in disarray. King Louis XIV of France ennobled Sainte-Marthe for his victory against the Dutch. The king had a medal struck to commemorate this feat of arms. Amblimont was made the first marquis d'Amblimont by letters patent. Later career (1674\u201396) Aves Barb- ados Cura\u00e7ao Grenada Guadeloupe Martinique Orchila Roques St. Christophe St. Vincent Tobago class=notpageimage| Islands in the Lesser Antilles In 1677 Amblimont cruised in the Antilles in the Alycon in the squadron of Admiral Jean II d'Estr\u00e9es and assisted in the seizure of Tobago . On 7 May 1678 d'Estr\u00e9es launched an expedition from Saint Christopher Island against the Dutch base of Cura\u00e7ao . He had 18 of the king's warships supported by more than 12 buccaneer vessels. His course was down the Lesser Antilles and then west past the Orchila , Roques and Aves islands. The fleet strayed too far south when near the Aves Archipelago and during the night of 11\u201312 May 1678 the fleet began to strike the reefs. Amblimont's D\u00e9fenseur (50) was among the warships that sank. Others were the flagship Terrible (70), Belliqueux (70), Tonnant (66), Bourbon (56), Prince and Hercule . Six other ships sank, 500 men were drowned and the French lost most of their guns. The shattered remnants of the force had to retreat towards Saint-Domingue (Haiti). In 1680 Aublimont was made a commander of the Order of Saint Lazarus . In 1683, sailing with Jean Bart on the Mod\u00e9r\u00e9 , he helped capture two Spanish vessels in the vicinity of C\u00e1diz . In 1686, still on the Mod\u00e9r\u00e9 , he was part of a small squadron under Job Forant ( fr ) and engaged in battle near Cape Finisterre . On 2 May 1687 Amblimont left La Rochelle on the 52-gun Arc-en-ciel in command of a squadron with two other warships, Perle and Profond , and two transports carrying twelve companies of marine troops to combat the Iroquois threat. The flotilla made a fast passage and reached Quebec City on 29 May 1687. In January 1688 Amblimont married Catherine Balarin de Parisot. Their son, Claude Thomas Renart de Fuschamberg d'Amblimont, also became a squadron leader. Amblimont distinguished himself at the start of the Nine Years' War (1688\u201397) in a battle where, with four frigates, he attacked five English vessels, sank two, burned a third and took a fourth. On 27 July 1689 as commander of the Profond Amblimont destroyed a Dutch squadron off the Texel . On 24 May 1692 on the Victorieux he took part in the Battle of La Hougue , for which he was promoted to squadron commander. He was promoted to chef d'escadre in January 1693. He was made a commander of the Order of Saint Louis when that order was established later in 1693. Governor general of the Antilles (1696\u20131700) Charles de Courbon de Bl\u00e9nac , governor general of the French Antilles, died on 10 June 1696 and was succeeded as interim governor general by Charles de Pechpeyrou-Comminges de Guitaut . Amblimont was appointed governor general on 1 September 1696, and was received in Martinique on 14 March 1697. He died in Martinique on 17 August 1700. Guitaut was again interim governor until Charles Desnotz took office on 23 May 1701. Notes ^ Amblimont is in the Ardennes near Mouzon. The two communes were merged into \"Mouzon commune nouvelle\" in 2015.

{"id": "doc_fixed_186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_(magazine)", "text": "Asia was an American magazine that featured reporting about Asia and its people, including the Far East , Southeast Asia , South Asia , and the Middle East . From 1934 to 1946, it was edited by Richard J. Walsh, with extensive contributions from his wife, Pearl S. Buck . Under their influence, the journal published many prominent Asian literary and political figures and American authorities. It was headquartered in Orange, Connecticut . In 1946, after many years of financial trouble, it was merged into a new journal, United Nations World . Origins and development Asia magazine was established by the American Asiatic Association in 1898 as Journal of the American Asiatic Association . An editorial in the Journal explained: \"The ignorance of our people in regard to the countries of the Far East is unquestionably a serious obstacle to the legitimate extension of American influence.\" In 1917 Willard Straight , who had been involved in promoting American trade and investment in Korea and China since the turn of the century, and his wife, Dorothy Payne Whitney Straight , bought the magazine and renamed it Asia and continued its publication as a popular journal of commerce and travel. The Straights also were co-founders of The New Republic magazine. When Willard Straight died of influenza in 1918, his widow took over publication of the magazine. She married Leonard K. Elmhirst in 1925. The editors included Louis D. Froelick and John Foord, and associate editors Gertrude Emerson and Marietta Neff. Elsie Weil , who joined the staff about 1920, was the long time managing editor. Frank H. McIntosh painted many of the covers. Under Richard Walsh and Pearl S. Buck In January 1934, although ownership remained unchanged, Richard J. Walsh, head of John Day publishers published his first issue as editor. He announced that the magazine would no longer be a tourist handbook, and despite objections from some readers, the magazine was shifted from advertising luxury goods, travel and promotion of American commerce in the Orient to discussion of international affairs and current Asian culture and literature. In the first editorial Walsh promised readers a wide range of topics and views. The magazine's political stance changed as well. Walsh wrote that it would \"look upon Communism as objectively as upon art, and bring to religious concepts as open a mind as we bring to economic problems.\" Walsh soon brought his new wife, Pearl S. Buck , into the editorial process. In the following years, Asia underwent revolution and war. Walsh, as publisher of John Day, and Buck, as America's most influential writer about Asia, attracted and recruited a new range of Asian and American writers, many of whom promoted an anti-colonial agenda, such as support for Indian independence, and anti-racist program. Subscriptions rose as Americans become more worried about the oncoming Second Sino-Japanese War . Writers included William Ernest Hocking , the Harvard liberal theologian; Hu Shih , leader of China's New Culture Movement ; Owen Lattimore , the emerging authority on Central Asia; Lin Yutang ; Jawaharlal Nehru , the Indian independence leader; and reporters such as Nathaniel Peffer ; Edgar Snow , Nym Wales , and Theodore H. White , who reported from the front line on China before World War II. Buck wrote a regular book review column titled \u201cAsia Book Shelf.\u201d The magazine recruited corresponding editors to gather articles, including Gertrude Emerson Sen in India and H.J. Timperley , an Australian journalist in China. In 1941, Walsh and Buck bought the magazine from the Elmhirsts. They changed the name to Asia and the Americas in November 1942, and Buck assumed the editorship. She continued her attacks on imperialism, particularly British, and offered strong support for colonial independence movements. With the end of the war in 1945, however, Americans lost interest in Asia and the magazine suffered a financial crisis. Buck resigned as editor in 1947 merged the magazine with Free World and Inter-American to form a new journal, United Nations World . References ^ Journal of the American Asiatic Association .

{"id": "doc_fixed_192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konevets", "text": "The pilgrims on Konevets Island Konevets ( Russian : \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0446 ; Finnish : Konevitsa or Kononsaari ) is an approximately 8.5-km\u00b2 island famous as the site of the Konevsky Monastery . It is located off the southwestern shore of Lake Ladoga near the village of Vladimirovka. The island is part of the Priozersky District of Leningrad Oblast . The nearest town is Priozersk , which is located 40\u00a0km away from the island. The island of Valaam is 60\u00a0km away and Saint Petersburg is 170\u00a0km away by boat. There is a ferry link from Vladimirovka that makes the 6.5-km trip in 40\u201350 minutes. Geography and environment Sandy beach typical of Konevets The island is 6.5\u00a0km long and generally slightly less than 2\u00a0km wide. At its widest point near the monastery on the south end of the island, where it is approximately 3\u00a0km wide. The island is completely covered in sandy soil. The majority of the shore is covered in fine sand beaches. Topographically, the island is mostly level. The terrain of sandy heath slopes gently up from the shoreline towards the interior of the island, where two cliffs, Svyataya and Zmeinaya, rise up out of the ground to 34 m and 29 m above sea level respectively. The steep cliffs are the result of erosion when the water level in Lake Ladoga was slightly less than 20 m above the current sea level, thus reaching the base of these cliffs, thousands of years before the Neva emerged. The majority of the island is uninhabited, and covered by coniferous trees. The average annual temperature is 3.5\u00a0\u00b0C. The island experiences a short summer season, from mid June to the latter half of August. July is the warmest month on the island. Winters can be quite harsh, and it is possible to walk to the island across the ice then. History See also: Konevsky Monastery Horse Stone There is no certain information about the island\u2019s earliest stages. According to sources discussing the establishment of the monastery on the island, there was a rock named Kon-kamen or Horse Rock where the Karelians went to perform sacrifices. The rock is located approximately 1\u00a0km north-northeast of the monastery at the base of the west slope of Svyataya. The rock is a rounded granite slab that is 9 m long, 6 m wide, approximately 4 m high and 750 tonnes that resembles the head of a horse. An Orthodox chapel has been built on top of it. The Russian name for the island, and thus the current Finnish name, are derived from the name of the rock or perhaps the assumed original Karelian name Hevossaari ( Horse Island ). The island\u2019s Orthodox Monastery of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary was founded by Arseny of Novgorod in 1393. The Swedes captured the island and destroyed the monastery in 1577 and 1610. Sweden lost control of the island as a result of their being beaten by Peter I of Russia in the Great Northern War . The current buildings are mainly from the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. The island did not suffer any damage in the Russian revolution , as it had become part of Independent Finland in 1917. In 1940, during the Second World War , the monks moved to the interior of Finland and joined the monks at the Orthodox Monastery of New Valamo . The island was ceded to the Soviet Union and the monastery fell into disrepair. From 1944 to 1990, the island was used by the military and thus closed to the public. In 1991, visitors were allowed back on the island and repairs and renovations to the monastery commenced. Approximately 20 monks now live on the island, which has become a popular place of pilgrimage. Trivia A traditional Karelian folk song about the island is entitled Konevitsan kirkonkellot (The Church Bells of Konevets). The Finnish group Piirpauke recorded a version of this song in 1975. Heavy metal band Sentenced used the melody as intro on their 2002 album The Cold White Light .

Her father was King Sanatruk . St. Thaddeus, St. Sandukht and other Christians in Sanatruk 's prison Life King Sanatruk of Armenia discovered that his daughter had converted to Christianity , and he pleaded with her to renounce her newfound faith and return to her native religion. However, his efforts were unsuccessful, and the angry king proceeded to imprison both his daughter, the virgin Sandoukht, and Saint Thaddeus , subjecting them to harsh tortures. The governor of the royal palace, an Armenian prince, also attempted to persuade Sandoukht to abandon Christianity, but instead, he too converted to the faith. Finally, unable to tolerate the situation any longer, the king ordered the execution of both Saint Thaddeus and his own daughter Sandoukht, who were martyred in Shavarshan, the summer residence of the Armenian royal family. According to one version of the story, at the moment when a soldier plunged his sword into the heart of the holy virgin, a pleasant scent wafted through the air, and a bright light in the shape of a fiery pillar appeared in the sky, hovering over Santoukhd's body for three days and nights. Over 2,000 individuals who witnessed this miraculous event reportedly converted to Christianity and were baptized that very night. Saint Thaddeus buried Santoukhd's body at the same location. He was executed eight days later. References ^ Geoffrey Wainwright. The Oxford History of Christian Worship . p.\u00a0152. ^ Biwzand Eghiayean (1993).

He served in the executive Council of Victoria as a minister without office from 23 January 1893 to 27 September 1894 under the Patterson Government . Early life and career Joseph Henry Abbott was born 1 February 1830 in Birmingham, England to Mary Ann Abbott (n\u00e9e Signet) and Joseph Abbott. He studied at King Edward Free Grammar School in Birmingham up until age 12 when he left to work for his father who was a millwright . At age 21 he sailed in the Earl of Derby to Melbourne upon news of the Victorian gold rush . He arrived at Cole's wharf on 17 November 1852. Once in Victoria Abbott settled in the Forest Creek area and mined for gold successfully near Moonlight Flat and Wesley Hill . In early 1853, Abbott opened a general store two friends and combined their business with mining activities. The following year they built a puddling machine to process gold-bearing clay. Around this time, Abbott, alongside Ebenezer Syme and George Edward Thomson started the newspaper the Diggers Advocate which was a strong opponent against the cost of mining permits . Abbott was a reporter for the paper based in Bendigo . The paper ran for two years. In 1858, Abbott converted a shop in Pall Mall (Bendigo) into a hotel and theatre and also was elected to the Sandhurst Borough Council becoming chairman of the council (and a justice of the peace ) in 1860. In 1862 he opened a boot shop on Pall Mall, later expanding by adding a tannery at Strathfieldsaye . Politics In the 1876 Victorian Legislative Council election contested a vacancy in the North Western Province against Alexander Fraser . Despite being elected, receiving 51% of votes, the Elections and Qualifications Committee of the Legislative Council found that Abbott was ineligible to sit as a member due to insufficient property qualifications as the property in question was in fact owned by his wife and Fraser was instead elected. In 1883, Abbott represented Victoria in the Amsterdam Exhibition and the Royal Agricultural Show in 1894. In 1888 Abbott was elected to the Bendigo council , later becoming mayor in 1891. He was elected in April 1889 to the Legislative council in the Northern Province electorate until 1904 when he lost his seat.

{"id": "doc_fixed_199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cogman", "text": "Robert Bryan Cogman (born July 25, 1979) is an American television writer and producer . He wrote eleven episodes of the HBO series Game of Thrones . He is also the author of the book Inside HBO's Game of Thrones which features a preface by A Song of Ice and Fire author George R. R. Martin . Early life Cogman was born in Oklahoma City , and moved to the Washington, D.C. area when his father became Chief of Staff to U.S. Senator Dewey Bartlett . He attended Winston Churchill High School in Potomac, Maryland , a suburb of Washington, DC. He was in the class of 1997. He was educated at the Juilliard School and graduated with a BFA in Acting, class of 2001. Juilliard classmates included Lee Pace , Anthony Mackie , Tracie Thoms , and Steven Boyer . After graduating from Juilliard, \"spent the next decade working on his acting career, with little to show for it\". Unable to get consistent work as an actor, he sold printer cartridges on the side to pay rent. Career Bryan Cogman eventually became a writer for HBO 's Game of Thrones . His wife was working as a nanny for David Benioff , at the same time that Cogman was working on a pilot pitch script for a project that never materialized. Benioff agreed to read over Cogman's script, and was impressed enough that he hired him as a personal assistant. Benioff began working with Cogman and got him a job as a writer's assistant on NBC 's My Own Worst Enemy . The show only lasted nine episodes, but the same day it was cancelled, HBO officially picked up Game of Thrones with David Benioff as co-showrunner. Benioff hired Cogman as his personal assistant, copy-editing scripts in the first season, but then abruptly promoted him to be the official writer for the fourth episode. Cogman remained a staff writer for the rest of the show's run. In 2014, Cogman was hired by 20th Century Fox to write a feature film based on characters and stories from Magic: The Gathering , a popular fantasy trading card game. Cogman gave an interview with ThinkProgress in 2012. In 2015, it was announced he would pen the live-action remake of The Sword in the Stone for Disney . In 2016, he made a cameo on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episode \"The Gang Goes to Hell: Part Two\", as the Insurance Adjuster. In September 2017, Cogman was announced as a creator of a developing fifth Game of Thrones prequel series. In April 2019, Cogman confirmed that this potential series would not be moving forward. In May 2019, George R. R. Martin mentioned on his blog that Cogman would be helping Amazon Video with their new The Lord of the Rings series. More recently, he signed a deal with Entertainment One. In March 2023, Cogman was announced as the series showrunner for the Disney+ television adaptation of Zorro with Wilmer Valderrama set to star.

{"id": "doc_random_003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIDS_Helper", "text": "BIDS Helper is a Visual Studio open source extension with multiple features that extend and enhance business intelligence development functionality in all editions of Microsoft's SQL Server 2005, 2008, 2008 R2 and 2012. BIDS Helper improves the development environment for integration, analysis and reporting services. BIDS Helper is hosted on GitHub . History BIDS Helper was initially released on May 27, 2007. BI Developer Extensions for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 is published in the Visual Studio Gallery. The last version for SQL 2005 (Visual Studio 2005), SQL 2008 (Visual Studio 2008), SQL 2008 R2 (Visual Studio 2008), BIDS Helper 1.7.0 was released on March 17, 2015. In Version 1.5, released on June 7, 2011, Varigence contributed key portions of the Biml engine, including dynamic package generation to BIDS Helper. Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) is an XML-based language that allows a developer to describe a BI solution in a declarative fashion, similarly to using HTML to describe how a web page should appear. Version 1.5 also had the Expression Editor contributed by Konesans. Features BIDS Helper has dozens of features that improve the functionality of BIDS, SSIS and SSAS . They are classified into one of five categories listed below based on where they increase functionality in SQL Server: Analysis Services Multidimensional Aggregation Manager - an advanced interface for manually editing aggregations Calculation Helpers - enhances the Calculations tab of the cube editor Column Usage Reports - opens two reports about column usage: Unused Columns Report + Used Columns Report Delete Unused Aggregations - automates the process of detecting which aggregations are unused and deleting them Deploy Aggregation Designs - deploys just the aggregation designs in a cube. It does not change which aggregation design is assigned to each partition Deploy MDX Script - allows for right clicking on a cube in an Analysis Services solution and deploy just the calculation script Dimension Data Type Discrepancy Check - runs checks that DSV data types match the data types on the KeyColumns and NameColumn of dimension attributes. It displays any discrepancies and lets the user fix them with the click of a button. Dimension Health Check - checks various indications of dimension health Dimension Optimization Report - This report lists all dimension attributes and hierarchies on rows. On columns, it lists various properties which can be used to optimize dimensions. Duplicate Role - copies a role with all of the associated settings and permissions Many-to-Many Matrix Compression - Analyzing the data in a m2m relationship to determine whether it can be compressed significantly requires building a complex SQL query. This feature automates this process and returns a report showing how much each m2m relationship can be compressed. Measure Group Health Check - checks various indications of measure group health. Non-Default Properties Report - generates a report which shows all properties which have been changed from their defaults. Parent-Child Dimension Naturalizer - aids in converting parent-child dimensions into natural hierarchies. Printer Friendly Aggregations - allows for printing or exporting to PDF a report that lists every aggregation in a cube. Printer Friendly Dimension Usage - allows viewing and printing of a report encompassing all the information from the Dimension Usage tab. Roles Report - recursively list the members of the role and the members of groups in order to easily determine which members actually have access via each role Similar Aggregations - allows viewing a report that lists any aggregations which are very similar to each other. Smart Diff - compares versions of a SSAS, SSIS, and SSRS files. BIDS Helper pre-processes XML files so that the diff versus source control is more meaningful. Show Extra Properties - exposes hidden properties on several Analysis Services objects. It also provides a better UI for editing descriptions on Analysis Services objects. Sync Descriptions - if the source database has descriptions for relational tables and columns (for example, using the Kimball Dimensional Modeling Spreadsheet ) this function will import those descriptions to the dimension in Analysis Services. Test Aggregation Performance - test the performance of aggregations Tri-State Perspectives - this feature operates in the Perspectives tab of the cube designer. It highlights any measure groups or dimensions in which not all visible children are part of the perspective Update Estimated Counts - updates the EstimatedCount property of every dimension attribute and every partition with exact counts Validate Aggregations - quickly check whether any aggregations violate restrictions or best practices Visualize Attribute Lattice - allows for visually seeing the attribute relationships that have been defined for a dimension in an Analysis Services solution Analysis Services Tabular Smart Diff - compares versions of a SSAS, SSIS, and SSRS files. BIDS Helper pre-processes XML files so that the diff versus source control is more meaningful. Tabular Actions Editor - provides a UI for editing actions for Tabular models. For example, this feature allows the model designer the ability to customize the columns returned by drillthrough . Tabular Display Folders - provides a UI for editing display folders on measures, columns, and hierarchies. All display folders are edited in the same place. Tabular HideMemberIf - allows HideMemberIf setting to be changed Tabular Pre-Build - catches the build event and checks features for BIDS Helper settings that have been lost. Because these settings were backed up in annotations, they can be restored, and the user will be prompted if this is necessary. Tabular Sync Descriptions - if the source database has descriptions for relational tables and columns (for example, using the Kimball Dimensional Modeling Spreadsheet) this function will import those descriptions to the table in a Tabular model in Analysis Services. Tabular Translations Editor - allows for coding in one language but display the model to users in another language. For example, the model might be coded in English but display to users in Spanish. Integration Services Batch Property Update - Allows for updating multiple packages properties at once Biml Package Generator - provides the ability to create packages from Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) Create Fixed Width Columns - allows for the use of an Excel spreadsheet to create the column definitions in a few simple steps. Deploy SSIS Packages - quickly deploy SSIS packages directly from BIDS without having to create a deployment manifest and use the Package Installation Wizard. Design Warnings - provides similar functionality to the Design Warning feature in Analysis Services 2008. It compares the current package against a list of design guidelines, and adds warnings to the Error List in Visual Studio for any items that need to be investigated. dtsConfig File Formatter - watches for when a window is activated or created for a file with a .dtsConfig extension and automatically initiates the Visual Studio formatting feature Expression and Configuration Highlighter - gives a visual indicator so that the influence of expressions and package configurations can be seen at a glance Expression List - provides a window that lists all the expressions defined in a package Fix Relative Paths - helpful in setting up packages to use relative paths in connection managers and in the path to dtsConfig files Non-Default Properties Report - displays on one screen all properties which have been changed from their defaults Pipeline Component Performance Breakdown - automates the methodology for determining which piece of a data flow task is the bottleneck and shows a trend of component performance as different settings and design alternative are tested Reset GUIDs - resets the IDs for all tasks, connection managers, configurations, event handlers, variables, and the package ID itself Smart Diff - compares versions of a SSAS, SSIS and SSRS files Sort Project Files - adds a \"Sort by name\" menu option to the \"SSIS Packages\" folder of an SSIS project in Visual Studio Sortable Package Properties Report - This report shows the following properties for every SSIS package in the project or solution: Package, Name, ID, Description, Creator Name, Creation Date, Creator Computer Name, Version Build, Version GUID, Version Major, Version Minor SSIS Performance Visualization - shows a graphical gantt chart view of the execution durations and dependencies for a package to help visualize performance Variables Window Extensions - is designed to extend the Variables window in the SSIS package designer Reporting Services Dataset Usage Reports - displays a list of used and unused Reporting Services datasets Delete Dataset Cache Files - automates the deletion of the .rdl.data files Smart Diff - compares versions of a SSAS, SSIS, and SSRS files General Enable/Disable features - allows for the enable and disable individual features Preferences - allows for the configuration of features via a Preferences screen Version Notification - assists in staying current by displaying an alert when a new BIDS Helper version is released References ^ \"BIDS Helper - People\" .

{"id": "doc_random_004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Dagger", "text": "The Dennis Dagger is a compact fire engine manufactured by Dennis Specialist Vehicles from 1998 to 2007. It was built for fire brigades operating in narrow rural areas unsuitable for full-size fire engines, a market previously explored by the Dennis DS series . First designed in 1997 with the internal codename of F98 (short for Fire 1998 ), production would begin by 2002. Visually and mechanically similar to the full-size Dennis Sabre , the Dennis Dagger could be bodied with a John Dennis Coachbuilders body. Sales were originally aimed at the Kent and Devon and Somerset fire services, but in competition with other narrow truck conversions such as the MAN truck range , the Dagger sold poorly, going on to be the final new fire engine produced by Dennis Specialist Vehicles before the company's closure in 2007. Operators of the Dennis Dagger included the Hertfordshire and West Sussex fire brigades, with the Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service and the Dublin Fire Brigade respectively operating two former demonstrators in the past. A development chassis was registered as late as 2011. Outside of the UK, the New Zealand Fire Service is the only known foreign customer and operator of the Dagger, after a pair were ordered as a trial in 2004.

In 1021/22, he surrendered his kingdom to the Byzantine emperor Basil II , receiving in return extensive lands in the Empire, and the governorship of Cappadocia . Life Senekerim-Hovhannes was the youngest son of Abusahl-Hamazasp . He had two older brothers, Ashot-Sahak and Gurgen-Khachik . On the death of Abusahl in 968, the kingdom was divided among his three sons, and Ashot, as the eldest, retained the royal title and the suzerainty over his younger brothers. On his death, royal power was usurped by the second son, Gurgen, who reigned as king until his own death in 1003. In 1000, when the Byzantine emperor Basil II visited the East and annexed the principality of Tao , both Senekerim and his brother Gurgen visited him and paid him homage, receiving rich gifts in return. According to Stephen of Taron , Basil also sent letters to the neighbouring Muslim potentates declaring that Vaspurakan was under his protection, and warning them to stop their raids. Matthew of Edessa on the other hand reports that Basil concluded a treaty of alliance with the two brothers. The throne of Senekerim-Hovhannes Artsruni c. 1880-1892 Following Gurgen's death in 1003, Senekerim also withheld power from his nephews and crowned himself king. Throughout his reign, his position on the throne remained insecure, partly due to his usurpation, and partly due to the ever mounting raids of various Turkmen groups. As a result he approached Basil, along with his relative, the Artsruni ruler of Andzevatsi , offering to surrender their realms to the Empire in exchange for large domains in eastern Asia Minor . Mounting Turkish pressure, and especially a devastating raid in 1018/19, in which the Armenian army proved unable to counter the Turkish horse archers, eventually led to the cession of Vaspurakan being realized in the winter of 1021/22. The entire realm, comprising 72 fortresses and 3,000 to 4,400 villages, according to contemporary accounts, was annexed by the Byzantines and became the new theme (province) of Asprakania or Upper Media . Basil Argyros became the new province's first governor. In recompense, Senekerim received the title of patrikios and the post of strategos of the theme of Cappadocia , as well as possession of the cities of Sebasteia , Larissa , Abara and many other settlements. He was followed west by his family and 14,000 retainers. Several of Senekerim's relatives likewise received titles and gifts from the Emperor. Senekerim died in 1025 or 1027, although Matthew of Edessa erroneously places his death in 1029/30. He was succeeded by his eldest son David . Family Senekerim was married to a lady called Khushush (\u03a7\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1, Chousousa , in Greek). He had four sons, David, Atom, Abu Sahl, and Constantine, and apparently two daughters, including Mariam of Vaspurakan , the first wife of the Georgian king George I , and another, whose name is recorded in incomplete form as S.n.ghar.

{"id": "doc_random_011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berhtwald", "text": "For Saint Bertwald of Ramsbury, see Bertwald of Ramsbury . Berhtwald (died 731) was the ninth Archbishop of Canterbury in England. His predecessor had been Theodore of Tarsus . Berhtwald begins the first continuous series of native-born Archbishops of Canterbury, although there had been previous Anglo-Saxon archbishops, they did not succeed each other until Berhtwald's successor Tatwine . Berhtwald's period as archbishop coincided with the end of Wilfrid 's long struggle to regain the Bishopric of York , and the two-year delay between Theodore's death in 690 and Berhtwald's election may have been due to efforts to select Wilfrid for Canterbury. After his election, Berhtwald went to Gaul for consecration and then presided over two councils that attempted to settle the Wilfrid issue, finally succeeding at the second council in 705. Berhtwald was also the recipient of the first surviving letter close in Western Europe. Early life Little is known of Berhtwald's ancestry or his early life, but he was born around the middle of the seventh century. By 679, he was made abbot of the monastery at Reculver in Kent , and a charter dated May 679 names Berhtwald as abbot. This charter, from Hlothere , King of Kent , is the earliest surviving original Anglo-Saxon charter . Election as archbishop The see of Canterbury was vacant for two years after the death of Theodore before Berhtwald was elected to the office on 1 July 692. The long vacancy resulted from the disturbed conditions in the kingdom of Kent at the time, as various kings fought for control. The succession to the kingdom was disputed between rival claimants Oswine and Wihtred , and various outside kings, including Caedwalla and Swaefheard raided and plundered Kent. Eventually, Wihtred secured the throne, around 691 or early 692, as Bede names Wihtred as King of Kent, along with Swaefheard, at the time of Berhtwald's election. Swaerfheard, however, is not named as king of Kent after this date. The vacancy may also have occurred because Wilfrid, who was at that point having problems in Northumbria, desired to become Archbishop of Canterbury. A contemporary biographer of Wilfrid, Stephen of Ripon , says that Theodore had wished for Wilfrid to succeed Theodore at Canterbury. \u00c6thelred of Mercia may have supported Wilfrid's translation to Canterbury also, but despite these desires, the translation did not happen. Berhtwald was consecrated on 29 June 693, having travelled to France for his consecration as archbishop of Canterbury by Godwin, Archbishop of Lyon . Berhtwald went to the continent for consecration probably because he feared that his election was not supported by all of the kings and bishops. After his consecration, Berhtwald travelled to Rome to obtain the support of Pope Sergius I , who wrote to a number of Anglo-Saxon kings and bishops in support of the archbishop. Two of these letters survive, and their authenticity has been doubted, mainly because they are only preserved as part of the post- Norman Conquest Canterbury-York dispute . Historians have since come to regard the two letters as genuine. Sergius also gave Berhtwald a pallium , the symbol of an archbishop's authority. Archbishop Berhtwald appears to have been involved in the governance of the church, establishing the bishopric of Sherborne in Wessex and it was during his tenure that Sussex , the last pagan kingdom in England, was converted to Christianity. He also consecrated the first Bishop of Selsey . During his time in office, King Wihtred of Kent in the Law of Wihtred exempted the church from taxation. Berhtwald was a proponent of his predecessor's view of the archbishops of Canterbury as primates of the entire island of Britain. Berhtwald co-operated closely with Wihtred in the kingdom, and secured the exemption of the church from taxation under Wihtred's laws issued in 695. The law code also dealt with other ecclesiastical matters, including marriage, Sunday observance, and pagan worship. This law code resulted from a royal council that was held at Bearsted . Further privileges for the church were issued in 699, and may have been composed by Berhtwald before being promulgated. Another privilege, usually referred to as the \"Privilege of Wihtred\", is claimed to be a grant from Wihtred to the monasteries of Kent of exemption from non-clerical control. However, this is actually a ninth-century forgery. Much of Berhtwald's time in office coincided with the efforts of Wilfrid to regain the see of York and to reverse the division of York into smaller dioceses. Berhtwald was opposed to Wilfrid's desire to restore some separated bishoprics to the bishopric of York as well as regaining his old see. Wilfrid's problems had begun during the archbishopric of Berhtwald's predecessor, Theodore of Tarsus, when Wilfrid had quarreled with the King of Northumbria, Ecgfrith , and was expelled from the north. Theodore had taken the opportunity to divide the large see of York into a number of smaller dioceses, and Wilfrid had appealed to the papacy in Rome. Berhtwald inherited the dispute and presided at the Council of Austerfield in 702, at which Wilfrid's biographer relates the story that King Aldfrith of Northumbria , Berhtwald, and the other enemies of Wilfrid conspired to deprive Wilfrid of all his offices and possessions. A more likely story is that Berhtwald managed to secure concessions from the Northumbrians and tried to broker a compromise. The offer in the end was that Wilfrid would retire to Ripon and cease acting as a bishop. Wilfrid rejected this compromise and once more appealed to the pope. Three years later, at a further Council, it was arranged that Wilfrid should receive the Bishopric of Hexham in place of that of York. This was the Council of Nidd , usually dated to 706, and it was held in Northumbria. Bede also mentions that Berhtwald consecrated a number of bishops, including Tobias as Bishop of Rochester . One of Berhtwald's letters has been preserved, sent to Forthhere , Bishop of Sherborne, and asking Forthhere to intercede with Beorwold, the Abbot of Glastonbury, to ransom a slave. Another letter, this one addressed to Berhtwald, from Waldhere , Bishop of London , also survives. The main interest in the second letter is that it is the oldest surviving letter close in Western Europe. This second letter also relates that Waldhere and Berhtwald had attended a synod which can be dated to sometime between 703 and 705, where the kingdom of Wessex was threatened with excommunication. A charter witnessed by Berhtwald which mentions a supposed 706 council, numbered 54 by Sawyer, is now known to be a fake, although the witness list may be based on a legitimate 8th century charter that no longer survives. Likewise, a charter with Berhtwald as a witness and relating to the 716 Council of Clofesho is also known to be a 9th-century forgery, although again it may have been based on actual documents from the council. Death and legacy Berhtwald died on 13 January 731. An epitaph to him in verse survives, and may have been placed over his tomb, which was at Canterbury. Subsequently he was canonised with a feast day of 9 January. Little evidence of extensive cult activity exists, however, and the main evidence for his sainthood is a late medieval entry in a St Augustine's calendar. Berhtwald is the first of the continuous series of native-born archbishops in England, although there had been two previous Anglo-Saxon archbishops at Canterbury\u2014 Deusdedit and Wighard .

{"id": "doc_random_012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroxene", "text": "Pyroxene ( diopside ) crystals from Afghanistan The pyroxenes (commonly abbreviated Px ) are a group of important rock-forming inosilicate minerals found in many igneous and metamorphic rocks . Pyroxenes have the general formula XY(Si,Al) 2 O 6 , where X represents ions of calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), iron (Fe(II)) or magnesium (Mg) and more rarely zinc , manganese or lithium , and Y represents ions of smaller size, such as chromium (Cr), aluminium (Al), magnesium (Mg), cobalt (Co), manganese (Mn), scandium (Sc), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V) or even iron (Fe(II) or Fe(III)). Although aluminium substitutes extensively for silicon in silicates such as feldspars and amphiboles , the substitution occurs only to a limited extent in most pyroxenes. They share a common structure consisting of single chains of silica tetrahedra . Pyroxenes that crystallize in the monoclinic system are known as clinopyroxenes and those that crystallize in the orthorhombic system are known as orthopyroxenes . The name pyroxene is derived from the Ancient Greek words for 'fire' ( \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1 , pur ) and 'stranger' ( \u03be\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 , x\u00e9nos ). Pyroxenes were so named due to their presence in volcanic lavas , where they are sometimes found as crystals embedded in volcanic glass ; it was assumed they were impurities in the glass, hence the name meaning \"fire stranger\". However, they are simply early-forming minerals that crystallized before the lava erupted. The upper mantle of Earth is composed mainly of olivine and pyroxene minerals. Pyroxene and feldspar are the major minerals in basalt , andesite , and gabbro rocks. Structure Pyroxenes are the most common single-chain silicate minerals (the only other important group of single-chain silicates, the pyroxenoids , are much less common.) Their structure consists of parallel chains of negatively-charged silica tetrahedra bonded together by metal cations. In other words, each silicon ion in a pyroxene crystal is surrounded by four oxygen ions forming a tetrahedron around the relatively small silicon ion. Each silicon ion shares two oxygen ions with neighboring silicon ions in the chain. The tetrahedra in the chain all face in the same direction, so that two oxygen ions are located on one face of the chain for every oxygen ion on the other face of the chain. The oxygen ions on the narrower face are described as apical oxygen ions. Pairs of chains are bound together on their apical sides by Y cations, with each Y cation surrounded by six oxygen ions. The resulting pairs of single chains have sometimes been likened to I-beams . The I-beams interlock, with additional X cations bonding the outer faces of the I-beams to neighboring I-beams and providing the remaining charge balance. This binding is relatively weak and gives pyroxenes their characteristic cleavage . A single chain of silicon tetrahedra viewed in the [100] direction A single chain of silica tetrahedra viewed in the [010] direction Structure of pyroxene looking along the silica chains. \"I-beams\" are outlined in green. Silicon ions are oversized to emphasize the silicon chains. Chemistry and nomenclature The chain silicate structure of the pyroxenes offers much flexibility in the incorporation of various cations and the names of the pyroxene minerals are primarily defined by their chemical composition. Pyroxene minerals are named according to the chemical species occupying the X (or M2) site, the Y (or M1) site, and the tetrahedral T site. Cations in Y (M1) site are closely bound to 6 oxygens in octahedral coordination. Cations in the X (M2) site can be coordinated with 6 to 8 oxygen atoms, depending on the cation size. As of 1989 , twenty mineral names are recognised by the International Mineralogical Association's Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names and 105 previously used names have been discarded. Pyroxene nomenclature Pyroxene quadrilateral nomenclature of the calcium, magnesium, iron pyroxenes Pyroxene triangle nomenclature of the sodium pyroxenes A typical pyroxene has mostly silicon in the tetrahedral site and predominantly ions with a charge of +2 in both the X and Y sites, giving the approximate formula XYT 2 O 6 . The names of the common calcium\u2013iron\u2013magnesium pyroxenes are defined in the 'pyroxene quadrilateral'. The enstatite-ferrosilite series ( [Mg,Fe]SiO 3 ) includes the common rock-forming mineral hypersthene , contains up to 5\u00a0mol.% calcium and exists in three polymorphs, orthorhombic orthoenstatite and protoenstatite and monoclinic clinoenstatite (and the ferrosilite equivalents). Increasing the calcium content prevents the formation of the orthorhombic phases and pigeonite ( [Mg,Fe,Ca][Mg,Fe]Si 2 O 6 ) only crystallises in the monoclinic system. There is no complete solid solution in calcium content and Mg-Fe-Ca pyroxenes with calcium contents between about 15 and 25\u00a0mol.% are not stable with respect to a pair of exolved crystals. This leads to a miscibility gap between pigeonite and augite compositions. There is an arbitrary separation between augite and the diopside-hedenbergite ( CaMgSi 2 O 6 \u2212CaFeSi 2 O 6 ) solid solution. The divide is taken at >\u00a045\u00a0mol.% Ca. As the calcium ion cannot occupy the Y site, pyroxene with more than 50\u00a0mol.% calcium is not possible. A related mineral, wollastonite ( CaSiO 3 ), has the formula of the hypothetical calcium end member ( Ca 2 Si 2 O 6 ), but important structural differences mean that it is instead classified as a pyroxenoid. Magnesium, calcium and iron are by no means the only cations that can occupy the X and Y sites in the pyroxene structure. A second important series of pyroxene minerals is the sodium-rich pyroxenes, corresponding to the 'pyroxene triangle' nomenclature. The inclusion of sodium, which has a charge of 1+, into the pyroxene implies the need for a mechanism to make up the \"missing\" positive charge. In jadeite and aegirine , this is added by the inclusion of a 3+ cation (aluminium and iron(III), respectively) on the Y site. Sodium pyroxenes with more than 20\u00a0mol.% calcium, magnesium or iron(II) components are known as omphacite and aegirine-augite . With 80% or more of these components, the pyroxene is classified using the quadrilateral diagram. First X-ray diffraction view of Martian soil \u2013 CheMin analysis reveals feldspar , pyroxenes, olivine and more ( Curiosity rover at \" Rocknest \") A wide range of other cations can be accommodated in the different sites of pyroxene structures. In assigning ions to sites, the basic rule is to work from left to right in this table, first assigning all silicon to the T site and then filling the site with the remaining aluminium and finally iron(III); extra aluminium or iron can be accommodated in the Y site and bulkier ions on the X site. Not all the resulting mechanisms to achieve charge neutrality follow the sodium example above, and there are several alternative schemes: Coupled substitutions of 1+ and 3+ ions on the X and Y sites respectively. For example, Na and Al give the jadeite (NaAlSi 2 O 6 ) composition. Coupled substitution of a 1+ ion on the X site and a mixture of equal numbers of 2+ and 4+ ions on the Y site. This leads to e.g., NaFe 2+ 0.5 Ti 4+ 0.5 Si 2 O 6 . The Tschermak substitution where a 3+ ion occupies the Y site and a T site, leading to e.g., CaAlAlSiO 6 . In nature, more than one substitution may be found in the same mineral.

{"id": "doc_random_014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop-erased_random_walk", "text": "A loop-erased random walk in 2D for 10 6 {\\displaystyle 10^{6}} steps. In mathematics , loop-erased random walk is a model for a random simple path with important applications in combinatorics , physics and quantum field theory . It is intimately connected to the uniform spanning tree , a model for a random tree . See also random walk for more general treatment of this topic. Definition Assume G is some graph and \u03b3 {\\displaystyle \\gamma } is some path of length n on G . In other words, \u03b3 ( 1 ) , \u2026 , \u03b3 ( n ) {\\displaystyle \\gamma (1),\\dots ,\\gamma (n)} are vertices of G such that \u03b3 ( i ) {\\displaystyle \\gamma (i)} and \u03b3 ( i + 1 ) {\\displaystyle \\gamma (i+1)} are connected by an edge. Then the loop erasure of \u03b3 {\\displaystyle \\gamma } is a new simple path created by erasing all the loops of \u03b3 {\\displaystyle \\gamma } in chronological order. Formally, we define indices i j {\\displaystyle i_{j}} inductively using i 1 = 1 {\\displaystyle i_{1}=1\\,} i j + 1 = max { k : \u03b3 ( k ) = \u03b3 ( i j ) } + 1 {\\displaystyle i_{j+1}=\\max\\{k:\\gamma (k)=\\gamma (i_{j})\\}+1\\,} where \"max\" here means up to the length of the path \u03b3 {\\displaystyle \\gamma } . The induction stops when for some i j {\\displaystyle i_{j}} we have \u03b3 ( i j ) = \u03b3 ( n ) {\\displaystyle \\gamma (i_{j})=\\gamma (n)} . In words, to find i j + 1 {\\displaystyle i_{j+1}} , we hold \u03b3 ( i j ) {\\displaystyle \\gamma (i_{j})} in one hand, and with the other hand, we trace back from the end: \u03b3 ( n ) , \u03b3 ( n \u2212 1 ) , . . . {\\displaystyle \\gamma (n),\\gamma (n-1),...} , until we either hit some \u03b3 ( k ) = \u03b3 ( i j ) {\\displaystyle \\gamma (k)=\\gamma (i_{j})} , in which case we set i j + 1 = k + 1 {\\displaystyle i_{j+1}=k+1} , or we end up at \u03b3 ( i j ) {\\displaystyle \\gamma (i_{j})} , in which case we set i j + 1 = i j + 1 {\\displaystyle i_{j+1}=i_{j}+1} . Assume the induction stops at J i.e. \u03b3 ( i J ) = \u03b3 ( n ) {\\displaystyle \\gamma (i_{J})=\\gamma (n)} is the last i J {\\displaystyle i_{J}} . Then the loop erasure of \u03b3 {\\displaystyle \\gamma } , denoted by L E ( \u03b3 ) {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {LE} (\\gamma )} is a simple path of length J defined by L E ( \u03b3 ) ( j ) = \u03b3 ( i j ) . {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {LE} (\\gamma )(j)=\\gamma (i_{j}).\\,} Now let G be some graph, let v be a vertex of G , and let R be a random walk on G starting from v . Let T be some stopping time for R . Then the loop-erased random walk until time T is LE( R ([1, T ])). In other words, take R from its beginning until T \u00a0\u2014 that's a (random) path\u00a0\u2014 erase all the loops in chronological order as above\u00a0\u2014 you get a random simple path. The stopping time T may be fixed, i.e. one may perform n steps and then loop-erase. However, it is usually more natural to take T to be the hitting time in some set. For example, let G be the graph Z 2 and let R be a random walk starting from the point (0,0). Let T be the time when R first hits the circle of radius 100 (we mean here of course a discretized circle). LE( R ) is called the loop-erased random walk starting at (0,0) and stopped at the circle. Uniform spanning tree For any graph G , a spanning tree of G is a subgraph of G containing all vertices and some of the edges, which is a tree , i.e. connected and with no cycles . A spanning tree chosen randomly from among all possible spanning trees with equal probability is called a uniform spanning tree. There are typically exponentially many spanning trees (too many to generate them all and then choose one randomly); instead, uniform spanning trees can be generated more efficiently by an algorithm called Wilson's algorithm which uses loop-erased random walks. The algorithm proceeds according to the following steps. First, construct a single-vertex tree T by choosing (arbitrarily) one vertex. Then, while the tree T constructed so far does not yet include all of the vertices of the graph, let v be an arbitrary vertex that is not in T , perform a loop-erased random walk from v until reaching a vertex in T , and add the resulting path to T . Repeating this process until all vertices are included produces a uniformly distributed tree, regardless of the arbitrary choices of vertices at each step. A connection in the other direction is also true. If v and w are two vertices in G then, in any spanning tree, they are connected by a unique path. Taking this path in the uniform spanning tree gives a random simple path. It turns out that the distribution of this path is identical to the distribution of the loop-erased random walk starting at v and stopped at w . This fact can be used to justify the correctness of Wilson's algorithm. Another corollary is that loop-erased random walk is symmetric in its start and end points. More precisely, the distribution of the loop-erased random walk starting at v and stopped at w is identical to the distribution of the reversal of loop-erased random walk starting at w and stopped at v . Loop-erasing a random walk and the reverse walk do not, in general, give the same result, but according to this result the distributions of the two loop-erased walks are identical. The Laplacian random walk Another representation of loop-erased random walk stems from solutions of the discrete Laplace equation . Let G again be a graph and let v and w be two vertices in G . Construct a random path from v to w inductively using the following procedure. Assume we have already defined \u03b3 ( 1 ) , . . . , \u03b3 ( n ) {\\displaystyle \\gamma (1),...,\\gamma (n)} . Let f be a function from G to R satisfying f ( \u03b3 ( i ) ) = 0 {\\displaystyle f(\\gamma (i))=0} for all i \u2264 n {\\displaystyle i\\leq n} and f ( w ) = 1 {\\displaystyle f(w)=1} f is discretely harmonic everywhere else Where a function f on a graph is discretely harmonic at a point x if f ( x ) equals the average of f on the neighbors of x . With f defined choose \u03b3 ( n + 1 ) {\\displaystyle \\gamma (n+1)} using f at the neighbors of \u03b3 ( n ) {\\displaystyle \\gamma (n)} as weights. In other words, if x 1 , . . . , x d {\\displaystyle x_{1},...,x_{d}} are these neighbors, choose x i {\\displaystyle x_{i}} with probability f ( x i ) \u2211 j = 1 d f ( x j ) . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {f(x_{i})}{\\sum _{j=1}^{d}f(x_{j})}}.} Continuing this process, recalculating f at each step, will result in a random simple path from v to w ; the distribution of this path is identical to that of a loop-erased random walk from v to w . An alternative view is that the distribution of a loop-erased random walk conditioned to start in some path \u03b2 is identical to the loop-erasure of a random walk conditioned not to hit \u03b2. This property is often referred to as the Markov property of loop-erased random walk (though the relation to the usual Markov property is somewhat vague). It is important to notice that while the proof of the equivalence is quite easy, models which involve dynamically changing harmonic functions or measures are typically extremely difficult to analyze. Practically nothing is known about the p-Laplacian walk or diffusion-limited aggregation . Another somewhat related model is the harmonic explorer . Finally there is another link that should be mentioned: Kirchhoff's theorem relates the number of spanning trees of a graph G to the eigenvalues of the discrete Laplacian . See spanning tree for details. Grids Let d be the dimension, which we will assume to be at least 2. Examine Z d i.e. all the points ( a 1 , . . . , a d ) {\\displaystyle (a_{1},...,a_{d})} with integer a i {\\displaystyle a_{i}} . This is an infinite graph with degree 2 d when you connect each point to its nearest neighbors. From now on we will consider loop-erased random walk on this graph or its subgraphs. High dimensions The easiest case to analyze is dimension 5 and above. In this case it turns out that there the intersections are only local. A calculation shows that if one takes a random walk of length n , its loop-erasure has length of the same order of magnitude, i.e. n . Scaling accordingly, it turns out that loop-erased random walk converges (in an appropriate sense) to Brownian motion as n goes to infinity. Dimension 4 is more complicated, but the general picture is still true. It turns out that the loop-erasure of a random walk of length n has approximately n / log 1 / 3 \u2061 n {\\displaystyle n/\\log ^{1/3}n} vertices, but again, after scaling (that takes into account the logarithmic factor) the loop-erased walk converges to Brownian motion. Two dimensions In two dimensions, arguments from conformal field theory and simulation results led to a number of exciting conjectures. Assume D is some simply connected domain in the plane and x is a point in D . Take the graph G to be G := D \u2229 \u03b5 Z 2 , {\\displaystyle G:=D\\cap \\varepsilon \\mathbb {Z} ^{2},} that is, a grid of side length \u03b5 restricted to D . Let v be the vertex of G closest to x . Examine now a loop-erased random walk starting from v and stopped when hitting the \"boundary\" of G , i.e. the vertices of G which correspond to the boundary of D . Then the conjectures are As \u03b5 goes to zero the distribution of the path converges to some distribution on simple paths from x to the boundary of D (different from Brownian motion, of course\u00a0\u2014 in 2 dimensions paths of Brownian motion are not simple). This distribution (denote it by S D , x {\\displaystyle S_{D,x}} ) is called the scaling limit of loop-erased random walk. These distributions are conformally invariant . Namely, if \u03c6 is a Riemann map between D and a second domain E then \u03d5 ( S D , x ) = S E , \u03d5 ( x ) . {\\displaystyle \\phi (S_{D,x})=S_{E,\\phi (x)}.\\,} The Hausdorff dimension of these paths is 5/4 almost surely . The first attack at these conjectures came from the direction of domino tilings . Taking a spanning tree of G and adding to it its planar dual one gets a domino tiling of a special derived graph (call it H ). Each vertex of H corresponds to a vertex, edge or face of G , and the edges of H show which vertex lies on which edge and which edge on which face. It turns out that taking a uniform spanning tree of G leads to a uniformly distributed random domino tiling of H . The number of domino tilings of a graph can be calculated using the determinant of special matrices, which allow to connect it to the discrete Green function which is approximately conformally invariant. These arguments allowed to show that certain measurables of loop-erased random walk are (in the limit) conformally invariant, and that the expected number of vertices in a loop-erased random walk stopped at a circle of radius r is of the order of r 5 / 4 {\\displaystyle r^{5/4}} . In 2002 these conjectures were resolved (positively) using stochastic L\u00f6wner evolution . Very roughly, it is a stochastic conformally invariant ordinary differential equation which allows to catch the Markov property of loop-erased random walk (and many other probabilistic processes). Three dimensions The scaling limit exists and is invariant under rotations and dilations. If L ( r ) {\\displaystyle L(r)} denotes the expected number of vertices in the loop-erased random walk until it gets to a distance of r , then c r 1 + \u03b5 \u2264 L ( r ) \u2264 C r 5 / 3 {\\displaystyle cr^{1+\\varepsilon }\\leq L(r)\\leq Cr^{5/3}\\,} where \u03b5, c and C are some positive numbers (the numbers can, in principle, be calculated from the proofs, but the author did not do it). This suggests that the scaling limit should have Hausdorff dimension between 1 + \u03b5 {\\displaystyle 1+\\varepsilon } and 5/3 almost surely. Numerical experiments show that it should be 1.62400 \u00b1 0.00005 {\\displaystyle 1.62400\\pm 0.00005} .

With 18 over 2.26\u00a0m ( 7\u00a0ft 4 + 3 \u2044 4 \u00a0in), it took a first attempt clearance and one miss to make it into the final. In the final, three remained perfect to 2.35\u00a0m ( 7\u00a0ft 8 + 1 \u2044 2 \u00a0in), with Mutaz Essa Barshim just one miss behind, while Donald Thomas passed his personal best. But Barshim seized the lead with a first attempt clearance at 2.38\u00a0m ( 7\u00a0ft 9 + 1 \u2044 2 \u00a0in). Thomas and home team favorite Ivan Ukhov couldn't make the height, while Derek Drouin set a Canadian national record clearing on his second attempt. World leader Bohdan Bondarenko confidently passed the height knowing it would require him to equal his world leading jump from the previous month and to break Javier Sotomayor 's championship record. On his second attempt at 2.41\u00a0m ( 7\u00a0ft 10 + 3 \u2044 4 \u00a0in), he made it to take the lead. Drouin took his three attempts and settled for bronze. Already above his personal best, Barshim passed to 2.44\u00a0m (8\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in), 1\u00a0cm below the world record, to try for the win but couldn't get it. Bondarenko watched, then took three attempts at Sotomayor's world record. Records Prior to the competition, the records were as follows: Qualification standards Schedule All times are local times (UTC+4) Results Qualification Qualification: Qualifying Performance 2.31 (Q) or at least 12 best performers (q) advance to the final . Final The final was started at 19:00. When the event took place, Ukhov and Shustov placed 4th and 7th respectively. However, in 2019 and 2020 these athletes had their results disqualified after receiving retrospective anti-doping bans.

On the eve of their wedding anniversary, Sam is forced to stop over at the office to discuss business with some clients. Pressed by his haste to get home as soon as possible, he does not notice that a lady has slipped a silk stocking into his suit pocket which, upon his return, is immediately discovered by Molly. She and George Bagnall, a friend of the family, learn that in another similar case, it ended in divorce. Judge Moore, their mutual friend, thinks it well to teach the two quarrelsome spouses a lesson and suggests that Molly get a divorce. Reluctantly, she agrees to separate from her husband. While the two are at the seaside, visiting friends, the young wife is unable to hide her unhappiness. Moore then tells her that the divorce petition would be immediately rejected if she and her husband were found together in an awkward situation.

On 23 March 2011, he became the vice chairman of the council, serving in that post until he resigned on 22 January 2012 after protests against him. Abu Salim prison massacre Abdul Hafiz Ghoga was actively involved in legal representation for the families of people killed in the 1996 Abu Salim Prison massacre . 2011 Libyan civil war Ghoga was a member of the National Transitional Council created during the 2011 Libyan civil war and acted as its spokesperson. Ghoga has argued that the council is working for a unified Libya, rather than letting rebel-controlled areas separate from areas controlled by Muammar Gaddafi ; \" There is no such thing as a divided Libya \". On 27 February, he said that the council was not seeking foreign intervention. On 20 March, he announced that over 8000 people opposed to Gaddafi had been killed. However, Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project , which compiles a database of all reported fatalities due to political violence on the African continent, listed 6,109 fatalities from 15 February to 23 October 2011, of which 1,319 prior to NATO intervention. Ghoga criticised a comment by Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa that was critical of the way in which the Libyan no-fly zone was implemented. Ghoga stated, \"Today, when the secretary general spoke, I was surprised. What is the mechanism that stops the extermination of the people in Libya, what is the mechanism, Mr. Secretary General? If the protection of civilians is not a humanitarian obligation, what is the mechanism that you propose to us?\" Resignation In January 2012, he resigned as Vice Chairman of the Transitional National Council.

Dorsal coloration consists of 4\u20136 symmetrically arranged rows of longitudinal dark-colored spots on moss green (male) or grayish brown (female) background. Cream-colored vertebral stripe is present. The belly is uniformly yellow. Males have an internal, subgular vocal sac . The male advertisement call is long (63\u2013151 ms) with 15\u201321 pulses; it is audibly pulsed even to the human ear. Habitat and conservation Adenomera martinezi occurs in grassy field environments associated with rock outcrops in sandy/muddy soil. The type locality is at a transitional Cerrado / Amazonian region. Males call after nightfall within underground chambers or from exposed calling sites, typically among grassy tufts. Given its very restricted known distribution, Adenomera martinezi is classified as a \" near threatened \" species. While it has not been reported in any protected parks, it has been seen not far from Reserva Biol\u00f3gica Nascentes Serra do Cachimbo , and its known home near an air force base is not subject to further habitat modification.

For the men's team, see Bangladesh national football team . The Bangladesh women's national football team is the women's national association football team of Bangladesh controlled by the Bangladesh Football Federation under the supervision of the women's football committee. It is a member of the Asian Football Confederation and has yet to qualify for the World Cup . Bangladesh are the defending champion at the SAFF Women's Championship , after clinching their maiden title in 2022. They also went on to win the championship again in 2024 after defeating Nepal in the finals. They also secured a bronze medal in the South Asian Federation Games 2010 and a silver medal at the SAFF Women's Championship 2016. History Origins (2007\u20132012) Women's football was introduced in Bangladesh when the nations first ever football tournament dedicated to women was staged under the Vision Asia programme in November 2007. Eight teams from different districts all over the country took part in the tournament. The tournaments success, lead to the Bangladesh Football Federation , organizing the 2008 Women's school football tournament, under the Vision Bangladesh programme. The National Football Championship for women was introduced the subsequent year, for different district teams to take part in. While in 2009, Golam Robbani Choton a veteran in the Dhaka football scene, was put in charge of the inactive women's national team. However, the Bangladesh women's team was continuously neglected throughout the late 2000s. Bangladesh played their first international game in 29 January 2010 against Nepal , during the 2010 South Asian Games , held in Dhaka, losing 1\u20130. The team impressed in the following fixtures, pulling of two successive victories against, Sri Lanka , and then Pakistan respectively. Although they suffered a 0\u20137 defeat at the hands of India during their last group stage game, Bangladesh secured the bronze medal. The team proceeded to take part in the, 2010 SAFF Women's Championship later on that year, which was played on home soil, but this time in Cox's Bazar . They won significantly against Bhutan and Sri Lanka (2\u20130 and 9\u20130), however they were defeated by Nepal in the semifinals. It was in 2011, when the football federation decided to launch the Bangladesh Women's Football League . The national team was active the following year, taking part in the 2012 SAFF Championship . They lost to India and Sri Lanka, attaining their sole victory against Bhutan, 1\u20130 thanks to a goal from captain Pru Suinu. Nonetheless, the team failed to advance past the group stages. Emergence (2013\u20132020) After 2012 SAFF Women's Championship , BFF started to make a structure for women's team. On the other hand, government started Bangamata Sheikh Fazilatunnesa Mujib Gold Cup Football Tournament from 2011, where a number of footballers from all-over the country showcased their football playing skill on a yearly basis, strengthening the national team's pipeline of talents. In October 2014, Norio Tsukitate was appointed as the team's first foreign head coach. Bangladesh team management started almost a year-long camp for 2014 SAFF Women's Championship , and Bangladesh team won two of there three Group matches and, reached the semi-finals where Bangladesh lost against Nepal by 1\u20130. After the tournament concluded Golam Robbani Choton returned to head coach duty. In the 2016 SAFF Women's Championship , Bangladesh reached the final having defeated Maldives 6\u20130 in the semi-final. Nonetheless, the inexperienced team lost 3\u20131 to India in the Final. The team's fortunes at the 2019 SAFF Women's Championship did not change, as they lost to India by a margin of 4\u20130 in the semi-final. Golden era (2021\u2013present) Rupna Akhi Masura Sheuli S. Nahar Maria Monika Sanjida Krishna Sabina (C) Shopna Bangladesh's victorious 2022 SAFF Women's Championship Final starting lineup Bangladesh did not make to the 2022 AFC Women's Asian Cup qualification . But, after that, Bangladesh played three FIFA Friendly matches, one against Hong Kong where they beat Hong Kong by 5\u20130 in 2021 and two against Malaysia where they draw one and beat one Malaysia by 6\u20130 before the 2022 SAFF Women's Championship .

In the semi-finals having defeated Bhutan by 8\u20130 and reached the Final. Bangladesh faced Nepal in the final where, Bangladesh clinched their maiden SAFF Women's Championship title with a 3\u20131 victory over Nepal in an entertaining final at the Dasharath Rangasala in Kathmandu on 19 September 2022. Peter James Butler became Bangladesh's head coach in March 2024. Bangladesh won their second consecutive title at the 2024 SAFF Women's Championship defeating Nepal 2\u20131 in the final. Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus meet with Bangladesh women football team that won the 2024 SAFF Women's Championship However since the 2024 tournament, relations between some players and Butler worsened. In February 2025, a group of players led by Sabina Khatun boycotted a training camp demanding Butler's resignation. The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) intervened and offered new contracts to players of the national team. The dispute was resolved by late March 2025. In June\u2013July 2025, Bangladesh took part at the 2026 AFC Women's Asian Cup qualifiers . The team secured qualification for the 2026 AFC Women's Asian Cup , their first ever for the continental tournament. Team image Colours The Bangladesh national football team plays in bottle green shirts and dark red shorts embedded. Also with red and green stripes. Green and red are the historic national colours of Bangladesh, originating from the national flag of Bangladesh.

Home stadium See also: Category:Football venues in Bangladesh The Bangladesh women's national team plays their home matches at the National Stadium, Dhaka & Bir Sherestha Shaheed Shipahi Mostafa Kamal Stadium . Media coverage Bangladesh's both home and away matches are broadcast live on Bangladesh Television & T Sports . Rivalries India Bangladesh has developed a competitive and closely watched regional rivalry with the India, especially in the context of the SAFF Women's Championship. For much of the 2010s, India maintained dominance in the fixture, defeating Bangladesh in the final of the 2016 SAFF Championship and again in the semi-final of the 2019 edition . However, a turning point came during the 2022 SAFF Women's Championship, when Bangladesh defeated India 3\u20130 in the group stage\u2014marking their first-ever victory over India in senior women's football and ending India's 24-match unbeaten streak in the SAFF competition since its inception in 2010 . Bangladesh went on to win the 2022 SAFF title, defeating Nepal 3\u20131 in the final, becoming champions for the first time. This rivalry has paralleled the rapid rise of Bangladesh's women's football team. While India still leads in overall head-to-head results, Bangladesh's growing competitiveness and historic 2022 win have made this rivalry one of the most anticipated fixtures in South Asian women's football. Nepal The rivalry between the Bangladesh and Nepal has grown steadily over the past decade, fueled by encounters in the knockout stages of the SAFF Women's Championship. While Nepal traditionally held the upper hand in earlier meetings, the balance of power has gradually shifted. The defining moment in the rivalry came in 2022, when Bangladesh defeated Nepal 3\u20131 in the final held in Kathmandu , capturing their first SAFF Women\u2019s Championship title and spoiling Nepal\u2019s hopes of a historic win on home soil. The match was widely seen as a turning point for Bangladeshi women\u2019s football, showcasing a fast, pressing style and a new generation of confident players nurtured through the country\u2019s youth development programs.

{"id": "doc_random_025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Kowalczik", "text": "Julius Kowalczik (1885-date unknown) was a Austro-Hungarian World War I flying ace credited with five aerial victories. Though he joined military service as the war began in 1914, he did not transfer to the Austro-Hungarian Aviation Troops until late 1915. Qualified as a fighter pilot in February 1916, he went into action in northern Italy the following month. He would score five aerial victories between 14 October 1916 and 29 June 1917. After surviving being shot down by Italian aces Antonio Amantea and Antonio Riva on 24 August 1917, Kowalczik was reassigned to instructor duty in January 1918. He survived the war, having won two Silver and two Gold Medals for Bravery . Biography Julius Kowalczik was born in 1885. Although he was born in Moravsk\u00e1 Ostrava in the present-day Czech Republic , he was of Sudeten German heritage. He joined the Austro-Hungarian military as World War I began in 1914. In late 1915, he received a transfer to aerial service to train as a pilot. On 16 February 1916, he was granted Austrian Pilot's Certificate No. 326. In March he was promoted to corporal and posted to Flik 15. He flew enough missions with this composite squadron in northern Italy that he earned his Field Pilot's Badge. In early May 1916, he was transferred to a newly formed unit, Flik 24, at Pergine Airfield. There he joined future aces J\u00f3zsef Kiss and Georg Kenzian . Although Kowalczik scored no aerial victories, his flying performance brought him a promotion to sergeant and a Silver Medal for Bravery , 2nd Class the following month. On 14 October 1916, Kowalczik and his observer shot down an Italian Farman two-seater for his first victory. It exploded upon impact near Pergine. In November, he received the highest award available to an enlisted man , the Gold Medal for Bravery. The Berg D.I , also known as the Aviatik D.I Kowalczik's next victories came on 18 March 1917. At 1000 hours, he and his observer shot an Italian Farman down in flames. At 1015, the Austro-Hungarians forced a Voisin to land. Although it is unclear if the awards came before or after these two victories, Kowalczik received a second award of the Silver Medal for Bravery, 2nd Class, as well as the Silver Medal for Bravery, 1st Class. It was also about this time that he went for fighter pilot's training. He qualified on both Albatros and Berg D.I fighters. On 10 June 1917, Kowalczik joined two other Austro-Hungarian pilots in an attack on an Italian Caproni three-engined bomber. He received the major credit in sending the huge bomber down in flames. Ten days later, he shot down an Italian Caudron two-seater to become an ace. Also in June, he received a rare second award of the Gold Medal for Bravery. On 24 August 1917, Kowalczik was shot down by Antonio Riva and Antonio Amantea . He successfully crash-landed his Albatros D.III in Val D'Astico. Kowalczik was so highly thought of that on 20 December 1917, he was deemed fit to be a Offizierstellvertreter (officer candidate). However, he was not commissioned. In January 1918, he was transferred from combat duty to become an instructor. In this assignment, he survived the war.

{"id": "doc_random_027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Palaeologus", "text": "Not to be confused with Antonio de' Massilara, Matteus Paleologus, (Bishop of Bosnia). Jacob Palaeologus , also called Giacomo da Chio ( c. \u20091520 \u2013 March 23, 1585), was a Dominican friar who renounced his religious vows and became an antitrinitarian theologian. A polemicist against both Calvinism and Papal Power, Palaeologus cultivated a wide range of high-placed contacts and correspondents in the imperial, royal, and aristocratic households in Eastern Europe and the Ottoman Empire ; while formulating and propagating a radically heterodox version of Christianity, in which Jesus Christ was not to be invoked in worship, and where differences between Christianity , Islam , and Judaism were rejected as spurious fabrications. He was continually pursued by his many enemies, repeatedly escaping through his many covert supporters. Palaeologus played an active role in the high politics of European religion and diplomacy over a period of twenty years before he lost imperial favour; and having been extradited to the Papal States , was executed for heresy by the Roman Inquisition . Life Palaeologus was born at the Genoese colony on Chios , one of the Aegean Islands near the coast of Anatolia , of a Greek father and an Italian mother. Chios had been, since 1347, ruled by the Republic of Genoa and by the 16th century it was a fief of the Giustiniani family. The young man attached himself to Vincenzo Giustiniani (later Master General of the Dominican Order ) and entered into the Dominican Order . He was educated in Dominican schools at Genoa and Ferrara, and later at the University of Bologna . He adopted the name \"Jacob Palaeologus\" and claimed kinship with the former Palaiologos emperors of Byzantium . Although in later life he repeatedly defended this claim, no independent sources survive that support it. The Grand Inquisitor, Michele Ghislieri (later Pope Pius V ); condemned Palaeologus to death in absentia, and remained his lifelong enemy By 1554, Palaeologus was back east in the Dominican convent of St Peter in Pera , the Latin Christian quarter of Constantinople , and it was here that he developed a lifelong adherence to antitrinitarian teachings of Michael Servetus , and composed a defence of Servetus' doctrines against their denunciation by John Calvin ; in consequence of which Servetus had been condemned to death in Geneva in 1553. In 1556 Palaeologus returned to Chios and actively supported the secular Genoese commissioners and the agents of the Holy Roman Emperor against the authority of the bishop of Chios ; this led to his being denounced to the Inquisition and arrested in Genoa in 1557. In 1558, he escaped to Constantinople, but was rearrested in Ragusa ( Dubrovnik ) and brought to the prison of the Roman Inquisition under the personal investigation of the Grand Inquisitor, Michele Ghislieri (a fellow Dominican friar, later Pope Pius V ). For the rest of his life, Palaeologus maintained a fierce opposition to the Inquisition, and a particular enmity for Ghislieri. Andreas Dudith, protected Palaeologus and employed his scholarship in support of the imperial arguments presented to the Council of Trent At the death of Pope Paul IV in 1559, the Roman mob looted buildings and burned records. Palaeologus escaped from prison when a mob stormed the headquarters of the Roman Inquisition and released inmates. Although evidence against him had been destroyed, he was subsequently tried in absentia by a Roman Inquisition tribunal, convicted, sentenced to death in 1561, and burned in effigy . Palaeologus escaped initially to France, where, in 1562, he unsuccessfully petitioned Cardinal Ippolito d'Este , the papal legate, to have the Inquisition heresy conviction overturned. Then later in 1562, realising that he was also not safe or welcome among Reformed Protestants because of his virulent denunciations of Calvinism, he offered help to Andreas Dudith , Bishop of Knin and the imperial representative at the Council of Trent . Palaeologus advised Dudith in the presentation to the Council of the imperial arguments for permitting communion under both kinds ; and in exchange Dudith attempted to have Palaeologus's heresy conviction overturned by the Ecumenical Council , stirring up in the process a major disruption to the Council's proceedings. Eventually in 1563, Palaeologus was granted imperial asylum in Prague ; and when the new Emperor Maximilian II succeeded in 1564, Palaeologus advanced in the imperial favour. Following the example of his patron Dudith, Palaeologus renounced his religious vows, marrying the daughter of a leading Prague reformer. In 1569, Palaeologus was proposed to the emperor as the Utraquist candidate to the office of Archbishop of Prague. This was however blocked by Ghislieri, his sworn enemy, who was now pope; and who eventually had Palaeologus expelled from the imperial dominions to Poland in 1571, where he was reunited in Krak\u00f3w with Dudith, who was now the imperial representative to the Kingdom of Poland. Palaeologus was openly advancing antitrinitarian views but became embroiled in a bitter controversy with Gregory Paul of Brzeziny and the Ecclesia Minor over the Polish antitrinitarians' condemnation of Christian service in the military. Ferenc D\u00e1vid, leader of the Unitarian Church of Transylvania; imprisoned, he was defended by Palaeologus in a succession of works. Having acquired enemies in Catholic Rome, Calvinist Geneva, and Anti-Trinitarian Rak\u00f3w in Lesser Poland; Palaeologus sought in 1573 a more congenial home in the Unitarian Church of Transylvania , whose Unitarian status had been established under the rule of Prince John II Sigismund Z\u00e1polya . Bishop Ferenc D\u00e1vid had corresponded with him since 1570 and sought his advice. By 1573 this was a well-worn path for Italian reformers and radicals; already taken, amongst many others by Giorgio Biandrata and Francesco Stancaro , and Paleologus found a receptive audience for his teachings. The aristocratic households of Hungary , Principality of Transylvania and Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth prized Italian culture and language, and most had sent their sons to Italian universities. Within their own extensive feudal estates they exercised substantial religious freedom \u2013 beyond the reach of Catholic bishops, Reformed city councils or the Inquisition \u2013 and many were sympathetic to radical Protestant ideas. Numbers of Italian religious exiles found ready employment in these places as physicians, chaplains, tutors, secretaries, and political agents. During 1573, Palaeologus undertook an extended trip to Constantinople and Chios (which had been captured by the Ottoman Empire from the Genoese Republic in 1566) \u2013 intended in part to impress Maximilian with his value and contacts \u2013 and then became Rector of the Unitarian college at Kolozsv\u00e1r ( Cluj ) and the leading theoretician of nonadorantism, the strain of radical Protestantism that denied the validity of addressing Jesus in prayer. Following Z\u00e1polya's death in 1571, the succession to the Principality of Transylvania had been disputed. Palaeologus supported Gaspar Bekes , the pro-imperial and antitrinitarian candidate, against Stephen B\u00e1thory , the Catholic candidate. Following two failed uprisings, Bekes conceded defeat in 1575 and Palaeologus moved to Krak\u00f3w where he promoted the cause of Maximilian, against that of Stephen B\u00e1thory in the 1576 Royal election in Poland ; and then settling in Moravia . Meanwhile, D\u00e1vid was accused of religious innovation and deposed as leader of the Transylvanian Unitarian Church for his nonadorant practices. He died in prison in 1579. Palaeologus wrote polemical works supporting D\u00e1vid and attacking Fausto Sozzini for siding against D\u00e1vid. Maximilan II died in 1576, and the new emperor Rudolph II was much less sympathetic, becoming convinced that Palaeologus was spying for the Ottoman Empire and possibly Poland too. Palaeologus was arrested by the Bishop of Olomouc in December 1581. Although the spying accusations could not be substantiated, a large body of heretical writings was found with him and he was extradited to Rome in May 1582. On February 19, 1583, Palaeologus was taken to be burned at the stake but abjured at the sight of a Portuguese Marani being burnt alive and was permitted to return to his cell. The College of Cardinals argued for his death, but Pope Gregory XIII insisted that if Palaeologus would denounce his former antitrinitarian opinions then he would be more useful alive. Although Palaeologus was now reconciled with the Catholic Church, he still refused to cooperate with Gregory's plan and was beheaded on March 23, 1585. A wide variety of radical groups emerged from the 16th century Reformation , commonly characterised by a rejection of clerical authority a rejection of the sacraments as essential instruments of God's Grace a rejection of the orthodox formulations of the Trinity These groups were commonly dismissed by their opponents as Anabaptists (although by no means all practiced believer's baptism ), a term that carried an implication of low social standing, limited education, excessive religious behaviour and the rejection of social and gender norms. Palaeologus conformed to none of these stereotypes. His command of biblical texts was at least the equal of that of the best of his antagonists, his knowledge of patristics probably better than any. He was formidably skilled in academic debate and wrote eloquently in high Latin style. Moreover, he was a strong critic of all forms of social subversion; and with his education from the University of Bologna, he was readily at ease in the Italian-speaking and Italian-educated aristocratic houses of central and eastern Europe. Even amongst those who did not share his vision of radical Christianity there were many, like Giustiniani and Dudith, who sympathised with his pleas for toleration; and his eloquent defence of free religious expression and debate in a Europe increasingly policed into tight bounds of conformity on one side or another. With the aid of his many contacts and correspondents, he appeared able to travel at will across the boundaries dividing Catholic from Reformed, and Christian from Turk. All of which made him a dangerous man, and explains the extensive, determined and persistent efforts of his opponents to have him silenced. Works Symon Budny, collaborated with Palaeologus in developing the theology of non-adorantism, and published his works Until 1571, Palaeologus claimed to be an Erasmian humanist , critical of the excesses of Papal Authority and of the Inquisition and sympathetic to some of the ideas of the Reformers, but still a faithful Catholic. All scholars agree, however, that Palaeologus' radical views in his subsequent published work are more representative of his earlier private opinions; and that he may well have become covertly convinced by antitrinitarian arguments as early as his stay in Pera in 1554\u20131555. It would accordingly have been unwise for him to publish much of his true opinions until moving to the Principality of Transylvania. However, following Z\u00e1polya's death in 1571, permission for Palaeologus, a foreigner, to print antitrinitarian works in the Principality of Transylvania was difficult to obtain; and most of his works of this period circulated in manuscript copies made by his students. From 1573 D\u00e1vid attempted to circumvent increasing restrictions on printing in the Principality of Transylvania by seeking to establish a printing press for radical Protestant works, dispatching Adam Neuser to Constantinople with funds for the project; and it is possible that Palaeologus's trip to Constantinople that year may have been partly related to this abortive project, as Palaeologus spent several days with Neuser there. It was only after 1578 that Symon Budny , who shared both Palaeologus' nonadorantist theology and his criticisms of the pacifism of the Polish Ecclesia Minor , established a printing press in Belarus and many of Palaeologus' works, often in anonymous editions, were printed there from 1580 onwards. Michael Servetus, executed in Geneva in 1553, his antitrinitarian writings were the formative influence of Palaeologus' theology Contra Calvinum pro Serveto On Palaeologus' arrest, a large body of theological writings, by him and others, fell into the hands of the Roman Inquisition. Some of these works are not known from the Unitarian archives preserved in Cluj and Krak\u00f3w; and selected extracts were published by the Vatican Library in the late 19th century. They propose a defence of Michael Servetus , and are believed to date from the 1550s. De peccato originis De providentia Two treatises written around 1569 in the form of open letters to Pope Pius V (Ghislieri); but intended for the Emperor Maximilian II. They criticise Calvinist teachings on predestination and original sin, also accusing the Inquisition of groundless persecution in its accusations and judgements against Palaeologus. Adversus proscriptionem Elisabethae Reginae Angliae , is a comprehensive scholarly refutation of the bull Regnans in Excelsis by which Pius V had excommunicated Elizabeth I of England in 1570. De discriminate Veteris et Novi Testamentum (1572), is Palaeologus' argument supporting the absolute continuity and consistency of the Old and New Testaments. Key to this is his rejection of the standard Christian identification of Jesus Christ as the Messiah, with Jesus Christ as the incarnate Son of God. Palaeologus expressed this as a formula of faith: \"God is one and Jesus is the Anointed\" a deliberate reworking of the Islamic shahada formula. For Palaeologus, the incarnation is a fabrication of the Church, unfounded and unscriptural. Jesus in his earthly ministry had been only and completely the true Messiah of Israel, and as such fulfilled in all respects the messianic prophecies of the Mosaic Law; which accordingly remains (for the Jewish people at least) in full force; only requiring their recognition of Jesus as Messiah. The resurrected Jesus was now with Almighty God, and would return as a universal deliverer to preside over the rule of the saints. Palaeologus appeared to believe that the historic coming of the Jesus as Messiah necessarily abrogated the sacrificial priesthood of the Old Testament; nevertheless his understanding of the historic Jesus entirely as a Jewish figure led to accusations of Judaizing from his opponents. De Tribus gentibus (1572), sets out Palaeologus' views on Judaism, Christianity and Islam; presenting three religious tribes who each are capable of providing an equal access to salvation; as each transmit to their members, within their respective scriptures, God's saving grace of divine revelation (albeit that the interpretation of this revelation has, in all three traditions, been corrupted by a clerical elite). The three true tribes being: Jews following the Mosaic Law who accept Jesus as Messiah (in which category Palaeologus also includes Coptic, Syrian and Ethiopic Christians); antitrinitarian Christians; and Muslims who recognise Jesus as a prophet. The treatise concludes with an eloquent defence of religious toleration. Dissolutio de sacramentis De Eucharistia De Baptismo De resurrectione mortuorum (1572) These four treatises refute the claim of Christian churches to have unique access to salvation through participation in the benefits of the atoning death and resurrection of Christ; by baptism and by the sacrament of the Eucharist. For Palaeologus, there is no need for specific rites of atonement, and no essential ceremonies as instruments of salvation. Salvation requires only a free, pure and unqualified acceptance of God's offer of divine Grace; an acceptance that is only possible, in Palaeologus teaching, within the fellowship of a faithful community of believers where the revealed scriptures are regularly heard and shared. De bello sententia , is a refutation of the pacifism of Gregory Paul and the Polish Brethren. Maximillian II, Holy Roman Emperor,was Palaeologus' ultimate patron and protector, and the intended audience for many of his works Epistola de rebus Chii et Constantinopoli cum eo actis lectu digna , is an open letter to one of his friends, but intended for the Maximilian II. It describes Palaeologus' trip to Constantinople and Chios in the spring of 1573, name-dropping numerous high-ranking officials and notable figures who had received him. Catechesis Christiana dierum duodecim (1574), is Palaeologus' most complete systematic statement of antitrinitarian belief, published in Kolosvar, this draws extensively on the six unpublished treatises. It is structured within a satirical imagined debate by which a Mexican Indian and a Jew seek an understanding of the Christian faith from a Reformed Protestant, a Lutheran and Counter-Reformation Catholic, but only find squabbles and inconsistencies until their confusion is resolved by an anti-trinitarian. Disputatio Scholastica , is acknowledged as Palaeologus major literary achievement, a masterpiece of exuberant high renaissance latinity. The setting is another imagined satirical debate; only this time the protagonists are named religious authorities on both the Trinitarian and antitrinitarian sides, who have been called together by Almighty God to resolve before the whole world (Christian, Muslim and Jewish) their various claims about the nature of Christ. The treatise is unfinished, but it appears to have been intended to show that the leading modern Trinitarians; John Calvin and Pope Boniface VIII , are not only unjustified in their arguments, but also culpably misrepresent the ancient predecessors to whom they appeal. Commentarius in Apocalypsim , is in the form of a commentary on the Book of Revelation, but is actually another stinging attack on Pius V and the Inquisition, and is dedicated to his old friend and original mentor Giustiniani. Theodoro Bezae pro Castellione et Bellio (1575), is a defence of Sebastian Castellio against the criticisms of the Calvinist leader, Theodore Beza . Castellio was convicted and executed in Geneva for blasphemy and heresy in 1553 \u2013 in particular for his repudiation of the doctrine of the trinity. An omnes ab uno Adamo descenderint , is a refutation of the fundamental assumptions of the doctrine of Original Sin; arguing that all humans cannot descended from a single individual, and hence that there cannot be a strict transmission of inherited sin to all humanity. Confutatio vera et solida Iudicii Ecclesiarum Polonicarum de causa Francisci Davidis (1580) Defensio Francisci Davidis in negotio de non invocando Jesu Christo in precibus (1580) These treatises were all printed by Budny in 1580; and defend D\u00e1vid against the charges of religious innovation in teaching nonadorantism; recording also Palaeologus' criticism of the role of Sozzini in the sorry affair. Ad scriptum fratrum Racoviensium de bello et judiciis forensibus Responsio , is Palaeologus' rejoinder to Gregory Paul's Adversus Jacobi Palaeologi de bello sententiam Responsio , itself a reply to Palaeologus treatise Defensio verae sententiae de magistratu politico (1572), about the obligation of a Christian to provide military service and secular allegiance to the rightful civil authorities. Teachings Thedore Beza, succeeded John Calvin as the leader of the Reformed church of Geneva; whose Trinitarian theology Palaeologus sought to expose as a Satanic perversion of the true Gospel In common with all 16th century antitrinitarians, Palaeologus rejected three fundamental propositions: Original Sin ; the doctrine that through the sin of Adam all humanity is lost to sin, and can only attain salvation through divine Grace operating through the sacraments of baptism and holy communion . Predestination ; the doctrine that the eternal destination of every person to Heaven or Hell has been determined from the beginning of time by God's sovereign choice. The Trinity ; the doctrine that within the unity of Almighty God, there are three persons; Father, Son and Holy Spirit; equal and pre-existent outside the bounds of time and space; and that the only way to salvation for all humanity is through the atonement for sin achieved by the crucifixion and resurrection of the incarnate Son of God . Palaeologus held these propositions to be frauds, perpetrated on the faithful under the prompting of Satan as devices by which the clergy might establish and maintain control; and he sees Calvinism as presenting these false doctrines in their most developed form, although the same doctrines are similarly exploited in other churches. Palaeologus appears to believe that counterpart fabricated doctrines may function to maintain the dominance of a clerical elite in Judaism and Islam; if all three religions were to apply a critical appraisal to their traditions, then substantial common ground would be found, and Satan's design to undermine scriptural revelation would be confounded. But in any case, in Palaeologus view, Jews and Muslims cannot be expected to respond fully to Jesus as Messiah and Prophet so long as Christians continue to worship him as God. Salvation, for Palaeologus comes only through faith , which he understands as being achieved fides ex auditu (Romans 10:17), through hearing and sharing the revealed word of God in the congregation of the faithful. Faith is assailed by sin , which Palaeologus understands as wrong intention rather than as wrong action; sin arises from seeking something that revealed scripture shows ought not to be desired. Palaeologus emphasises that all mankind has free will and God offers to all a free choice of blessedness. Nevertheless, individual humans in a state of nature do not have the capability to appreciate or comprehend the full dimensions of the choice that is on offer, but can only grasp at fragments of true blessedness in the form of material rewards (possessions, power); or in the case of noble pagans, in the perfection of the individual soul . Full blessedness can only be apprehended through lifelong participation in the fellowship of faithful believers; where that faith is grounded in the Grace of divine revelation. For Palaeologus the religious life of a Christian (or Muslim or Jewish) congregation is a school of blessedness for its members; by which they may become prepared to respond to God's offer of salvation in full freedom. But that is conditional on those congregations rightly understanding and sharing God's revelation in the text of scripture. Since the instrument of God's Grace for salvation is identified with scriptural revelation, then those who fabricate false revelation or who twist the understanding of true revelation are, for Palaeologus, the agents of Satan . Criticism of the Polish Brethren Palaeologus had encountered the Polish Brethren of the ecclesia minor in Krak\u00f3w, and much of his antitrinitarian teaching accords with theirs, while being more systematically expressed; and much more learned in presentation. He departed from their doctrines and practices, however, in two key respects; which proved the occasion for bitter controversy. Nevertheless, although Palaeologus perceived the arguments of his Polish opponents as Satanic perversions, this did not lead him to seek their suppression or that of their supporters. Just as hearing the revealed scriptures provides for Palaeologus an assured route to truth; so the exposure and confounding of error in free and open debate ensures the defeat of the Master of Lies. Fausto Sozzini, leading exponent of the theology of the Polish Brethren; attacked by Palaeologus both for advocating pacifism, and for his failure to support Ferenc D\u00e1vid Nonadorantism Although the Polish Brethren rejected the doctrine of the crucifixion as a sacrificial atonement for the sins of humanity, nevertheless they regarded Christ's sinless death and passion as promoting a saving faith through moral example, and Christ's resurrection as according him the status of Mediator for the faithful before the throne of God; and accordingly retained both a commemoration of the Lord's Supper and the invocation of Jesus by name in prayer. As formalised in the Catechism of George Schomann published in 1574, the church in Rakow retained many of the elements of trinitarian worship and doctrine, but re-expressed in accordance with antitrinitarian principles. For Palaeologus this was wholly unacceptable, as he understood the task of anti-trinitrarians in the present age to be \"witnesses of the truth\" (Revelation chapter 10), standing in open opposition to a world given temporarily over to the dominance of Satan. In due time the truth must triumph and Christ would return bring in the rule of the saints; but Almighty God could not allow that to happen while those saints were endowing Christ with the attributes of divinity. The veneration of Christ within the doctrine of the Trinity was, for Palaeologus, \"Satan's design\" to extend the period of his rule and stall the promised parousia , by corrupting the church into a form where Almighty God, in his absolute individual oneness, must turn away from it; and true antitrinitarians must not be compromised with it in any way. Pacifism and utopian egalitarianism The Polish Brethren, like almost all antitrinitarians, held that the Grace of salvation could only be achieved through full participation in the fellowship of faithful believers; and they consequently sought to reinforce this by separating themselves from the sinful world in an exclusive egalitarian community; in which secular distinctions of power and possession did not apply, and which resisted the demands of civil allegiance and military service. For Palaeologus, seeking the security offered by secular power, possessions and status was a valid, if fragmentary and inadequate, response to the universal human need for blessedness; and accordingly such motivations were not sinful in themselves; nor should believers reject distinctions of secular power and possession amongst one another, although distinctions of religious power and possessions were to be condemned. Palaeologus strongly resisted any suggestion that full participation in the fellowship of believers necessarily excludes either full participation in civic rights and allegiances, or the obligation to defend the legitimate civil order by military force; moreover he unreservedly condemned the practice of separation from the world, especially as this was enforced through the sanction of excommunication , a sanction that must necessarily deprive those subjected to it of eternal life.

{"id": "doc_random_030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athol_Trollip", "text": "Roland Athol Price Trollip (born 12 March 1964) is a South African politician and provincial chairman of ActionSA in the Eastern Cape. He currently serves as the Parliamentary Leader of ActionSA in the National Assembly. He was previously a member of the Democratic Alliance (DA), serving as the Federal Chairperson of the DA from 2015 to 2019 and the Executive Mayor of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality , serving from 2016 until he was unseated in a vote of no confidence in 2018. Trollip has served as a member of the National Assembly and as a member of the Provincial Legislature of the Eastern Cape Province. He served as Parliamentary Leader of the opposition between 2009 and 2011. He was the provincial leader of the DA in the Eastern Cape from 2002 until he was replaced on 6 May 2017 by Nqaba Bhanga . Early life Trollip was born in the town of Bedford in the Eastern Cape , attended Woodridge College , and studied Agricultural Management at the University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg. Career in politics Trollip at the DA's 2010 Federal Congress Trollip joined the liberal Progressive Federal Party in 1980. His political career began in earnest when he became a municipal councillor for the PFP's successor, the Democratic Party , in 1995. He was elected as provincial chairperson in 1998 and then as the renamed DA's leader in the Eastern Cape in 2002, a position he held for 15 years. Trollip served as a Member of the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature between 1999 and 2009. He unsuccessfully ran for party leader against Helen Zille in 2007. In 2009, Trollip became a Member of Parliament in the National Assembly and after winning a leadership contest against Ryan Coetzee assumed the position of Parliamentary Leader of the DA. On 27 October 2011, Trollip was defeated in his bid for re-election as Parliamentary Leader of the DA by fellow MP Lindiwe Mazibuko . He later left the National Assembly to return to the Eastern Cape Legislature in 2013, and was the DA's premier candidate in the Eastern Cape province for the 2014 general election . During this time, Trollip was involved with Helen Zille in welcoming King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo into the DA, despite his conviction on serious criminal charges. Dalindyebo was subsequently expelled from the DA when the conviction was upheld on appeal. In 2015, Trollip returned to national prominence within the DA. On 13 April he was announced as the DA candidate for Mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality in the 2016 Local Government Elections, and was also elected as the Federal Chairperson of the DA at the party's Federal Congress in May. In 2016, Trollip was referred to the South African Human Rights Commission (HRC) for alleged human rights abuses and unfair labour practices on the family farm near Bedford in the Eastern Cape, allegations that he strenuously denied. The HRC later abandoned the case, citing the difficulty of investigating events alleged to have happened between the 1970s and 2000s, and that the incidents happened before the current, constitutional dispensation and involved \"issues of pre-jurisdiction\". Later career In the municipal elections held on 3 August 2016 , the DA won a plurality of seats in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality . With the help of the smaller parties such as the United Democratic Movement , Congress of the People and the African Christian Democratic Party , Trollip was elected as mayor of that municipality. He served in the position for 2 years, under which the metro received a ratings upgrade from Moody's. Tensions soon arose between Trollip and his deputy mayor from the UDM, Mongameli Bobani , requiring frequent interventions by the respective party leaderships to mend the relationship. The relationship eventually broke down and Bobani was ousted from the coalition in late 2017. After this, Trollip faced several no-confidence motions. One was tabled to be held on 30 March 2018. The vote was postponed, because the city council meeting descended into chaos due to the actions of the opposition parties. In August 2018, DA councillor Victor Manyati abstained from voting in the no-confidence motion against the speaker, allowing the speaker to be removed. After the motion, the DA and its coalition partners left the council. The vote of no confidence in Trollip then occurred and succeeded. Bobani was then elected mayor with 61 votes in favour, and none against. The DA legally challenged the removal of Trollip as executive mayor. The party alleged that there was no longer a quorum in the council when the vote occurred as Manyati's party membership had been suspended after he abstained. However, the high court upheld Bobani's appointment, stating that Manyati had still been a DA member at the time and as such there was a quorum. Trollip subsequently assumed the post of leader of the opposition of the Nelson Mandela Bay council. In October 2019, he declared his intention to run for the post of Chairperson of the DA's Federal Council. The election was held later in October and Trollip lost to Helen Zille. He resigned as the party's federal chair, and resigned from all active roles within the DA on 23 October 2019, following the resignation of Party Leader Mmusi Maimane. Trollip resigned as a DA councillor in December 2019, following the ousting of Mongameli Bobani . Trollip joined the ActionSA political party in 9 February 2022. Personal life Trollip is a fluent speaker of Afrikaans , English, and isiXhosa . He has two children. Trollip married Janine Handley on 5 November 2016 at Kasouga.

He released two solo albums. Lancaster had the ability to vary his style between strict blues, and rock , jazz , soul and pop . He cited his influences as Roy Buchanan , Stevie Ray Vaughan and John Lee Hooker . Life and career Ernest Ray Lancaster was born in Georgia , United States . He later grew up in South Carolina before relocating with his family to Mount Dora, Florida . He formed his own band while at school, which eventually played at Stetson University and on television in Orlando . After dropping out of college, and getting married at age 19, he was a founding member of the Sex Change Band in the mid-1970s. As the backing outfit for Root Boy Slim , the band was a fixture in the mid-Atlantic blues and rock scene, and favored a mix of Memphis-style boogie rock/blues. They recorded an album for Warner Bros. Records in 1978, their first of six records. In 1989, Lancaster played on the Pee Wee, Fred and Maceo album recorded by the JB Horns . Lancaster's guitar work appeared on numerous albums in the 1980s and 1990s, before he released his debut solo album. That was Ernestly , an all instrumental affair, which was released on Ichiban Records in 1991. Other musicians Lancaster supplied guitar playing for included Rufus Thomas , Reverend Billy C. Wirtz , Kenny Neal , Noble Watts and Lucky Peterson . The latter musician was heavily involved in playing the Hammond organ on Lancaster's first album, with a co-starring credit noted on the album's sleeve. The AllMusic journalist , Alex Henderson, noted that \"Although not stunning, Ernestly provides some gritty and unpretentious fun.\" In 1993, Lancaster played guitar in James Brown 's backing band, during their European tour. Lancaster's second album, Lightnin' Alley , which comprised self composed tracks (in a similar vein to his first album) was issued in May 2008. He also appeared at the Boundary Waters Blues Festival . Lancaster died from pancreatic cancer , at his home in Mount Dora, Florida , in July 2014, aged 60.

{"id": "doc_random_036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCTN6", "text": "In molecular biology, DCTN6 is that subunit of the dynactin protein complex that is encoded by the p27 gene . Dynactin is the essential component for microtubule -based cytoplasmic dynein motor activity in intracellular transport of a variety of cargoes and organelles . Identification and structure DCTN6 was first identified and cloned as a subunit of the \"pointed-end complex\" of dynactin through biochemical purification. X-ray crystal structure revealed that dynactin p27 forms an unusual left handed \u03b2-helix (L\u03b2H) domain, and its phosphorylation site T186 is in C-terminal disordered segment. Function In intracellular transport Dynactin p27 forms a hetero-dimer with the other dynactin pointed-end complex subunit p25/DCTN5 in 1:1 ratio, and it is essential for p25 stability since they are co-knockdown by p27 RNAi. However, both p27 and p25 are not required for 19S dynactin complex integrity verified by velocity sedimentation. p27/DCTN6 and other dynactin pointed-end complex subunits (Arp11/ Actr10 , p62/ DCTN4 , and p25/ DCTN5 ) have been suggested to be involved in dynactin binding to specific intracellular cargoes. Co-depletion of dynactin p27 and p25 by p27 RNAi affects dynactin binding to endomembrane, and early and recycling endosome movements are impaired, suggesting that p27/p25 form a selective endomembrane cargo-targeting module. In mitosis In mitosis , unlike dynactin or dynein perturbation that causes mitotic spindle disarrangement and mitotic arrest, dynactin p27/p25 depletion does not affect mitotic spindle formation, pole focusing or dynein/dynactin targeting to kinetochores . However, dynactin p27/p25 are required for normal chromosome alignment, kinetochore-microtubule interaction, and proper timing of anaphase onset. Dynactin p27 C-terminal T186 residue is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 ( Cdk1 ) in mitosis and helps target polo-like kinase 1 ( Plk1 ) to kinetochores during prometaphase . This activity facilitates phosphorylation of important downstream kinetochore targets (such as tension-sensing 3F3/2 phospho-epitope) of Plk1 , which is important for recruitment of spindle assembly checkpoint proteins such as Mad1 and proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment.

Designer Yves Gardan intended it to be a smaller and simpler version of his Bagheera , a conventional low-wing, cantilever monoplane with fixed tricycle undercarriage and a fully enclosed cabin. However, although the Bagheera had seating for up to four people in 2+2 configuration, the Mowgli had no rear seat and could seat only two people, with space behind the seats for luggage. Like the Bagheera, construction was of metal throughout. The Mowgli was designed to use either a 67-kW (90-hp) or 75-kW (100-hp) Continental flat-4 engine. The Mowgli was available in the form of plans and kits, and plans continued to be available even after SITAR closed in 1972. The first example was expected to fly in 1970.

{"id": "doc_random_038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_the_Bride_Goodbye", "text": "Kiss the Bride Goodbye is a 1945 British romantic comedy drama film directed by Paul L. Stein and starring Patricia Medina and Jimmy Hanley . Plot Factory girl Joan Dodd and Jack Fowler are in love and expect to marry in due course. When Jack is called up for war service, Joan's socially-ambitious mother seizes the chance to encourage the attentions of Joan's older boss Adolphus Pickering, who is infatuated with her. Pickering proposes marriage and, under pressure from her mother, Joan accepts. The preparations for the marriage are under way when Jack returns unexpectedly on leave from the army. He visits Joan, and her mother hides him in another room whilst Joan's suitor arrives to request her father's permission to marry Joan. On the morning of the wedding, Joan finds out that Jack is back and tried to see her, so decides to go and explain to Jack. On speaking to Jack's mother, she finds he's already left for the station to go to Scotland, so rushes to catch him. While Joan is still on the train talking to Jack, the train sets off. The pair decide to visit Joan's aunt and uncle in another area, and they assume that she and Jack are just married, and prepare a bridal chamber for the couple, much to their embarrassment. Comic misunderstandings ensue all round, until Joan finally insists on the right to marry the man of her choice. Cast Production The film was shot at the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith . The sets were designed by the art director James Carter . Reception The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote: \"In spite of the worn-out central theme, leading to usual sort of jokes, this is a well-acted and directed comedy, with a strong supporting cast, and it will doubtless amuse many people.\" In British Sound Films: The Studio Years 1928\u20131959 David Quinlan rated the film as \"average\", writing: \"Broad romantic farce but well played.\" Leslie Halliwell said: \"Unsubtle family farce.\" The Film Report said \"there are many laughs and few dull moments\", but also found some of the humour on the risqu\u00e9 side: \"The situations at times come very near the edge and there are many suggestive lines\". Survival The subsequent history of the film is unclear. There was a record of a TV showing in the U.S. in 1953. The British Film Institute had been unable to locate a print for inclusion in the BFI National Archive and classed the film as \"missing, believed lost\". Due to its interest as a populist production of its time and as a lost Simmons appearance, as well as increasing appreciation from film historians of Stein's directorial output in Britain, the film is included on the BFI's \" 75 Most Wanted \" list of missing British feature films. The Huntley Film Archives posted a clip on their official YouTube channel, claiming to have a copy of the entire feature. In 2013 Renown Pictures Ltd released a DVD of the film.

{"id": "doc_random_039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Welsh_(English_footballer)", "text": "John Joseph Welsh Sr (born 10 January 1984) is an English football coach and former professional footballer who is assistant head coach at EFL League Two club Barrow . As a player, he was a midfielder who notably played in the Premier League for Liverpool , where he began his career before playing for Hull City , Chester City , Carlisle United , Bury , Tranmere Rovers and Grimsby Town . In 2019 he dropped down to play at semi-professional level with Atherton Collieries before finishing his career with Stafford Rangers . He was captain of the England under-20 team , and has been capped eight times for the under-21s . He represented England U20 at 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship . Career Liverpool Wavertree born Welsh, joined Liverpool at the age of 10. He progressed through the ranks, becoming captain of the Reserve Team in the process. Welsh trained with the Liverpool first team squad at their Melwood training ground from the middle of the 2001\u201302 season. In the 2002\u201303 season John Welsh played only one game for the first team\u00a0\u2013 his d\u00e9but match against Ipswich Town on 4 December 2002 in a League Cup fourth round tie at home\u00a0\u2013 when he replaced Vladim\u00edr \u0160micer in the 83rd minute. Also, he was amongst the substitutes for a number of European games. His first game in Premiership was against Arsenal on 4 October 2003, when he replaced Salif Diao in the 82nd minute, but he couldn't help his team avoid defeat\u00a0\u2013 they lost 2\u20131, and unfortunately for Welsh, his first act was to be booked for a foul on Ray Parlour . Welsh featured in Liverpool's run to the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final , coming on as a substitute in the round of 16 away tie against Bayer Leverkusen. Liverpool would go on to win the trophy but Welsh was left out of the final match day squad. Hull City After three starts and seven substitute appearances in all competitions for Liverpool, in August 2005, John went on a season-long loan to Championship side Hull City . The club were impressed, and in November 2005 agreed a deal which saw Liverpool take promising young winger Paul Anderson in exchange. The swap took place on 4 January 2006. However, three minutes into a match against Preston North End on 10 March 2007, Welsh dived into a tackle with Preston's Neil Mellor , a former Liverpool teammate. Welsh was carried off on a stretcher, and it later transpired that he had broken both the tibia and fibula in his right leg, ruling him out for many months. Loans away from Hull On 31 December 2007, Chester City announced they would be signing Welsh on loan when the transfer window reopened the following day. He made his Chester debut on 1 January 2008, in a 2\u20130 home defeat to Grimsby Town , and spent the rest of the month in Chester's starting line-up before returning to Hull. He joined Carlisle United on 27 October 2008 for an initial one-month loan making his debut against Hartlepool United . In March 2009, he joined Football League Two side Bury on loan and was released from Hull on 2 June 2009. Tranmere Rovers In July 2009, Welsh signed a deal with League One side Tranmere Rovers. He had a very consistent season for Tranmere, playing the holding midfield role successfully. Welsh also scored four goals in his first season at Prenton Park , including a volley in the 4\u20132 victory over Gillingham and a 25-yard strike in a 2\u20131 home victory over Brighton. The club offered him contract terms for the 2012\u201313 season. Preston North End In May 2012, it was announced that Welsh had signed for Preston North End on a two-year contract. He was voted Player of the Year and Players' Player of the Year of Preston North End for the season 2012/13. On 17 December 2013, Welsh extended his contract with Preston for a further twelve months, thus keeping him at the club until the summer of 2015. Despite Tom Clarke taking over the captaincy for the 2014\u201315 season, Welsh still played a major part in getting the club promoted via the play-offs. This form was rewarded with a new two-year contract. At the end of the 2018 season he left Preston North End and was given an award for longest serving Preston player. Grimsby Town Welsh signed a two-year contract with League Two club Grimsby Town on 25 June 2018. He was firmly installed as club captain for the 2018\u201319 season . Welsh left the club by mutual consent on 20 March 2019. This may have been in part due to his participation in a fracas at a bus stop in which he broke a woman's leg. Non-League In October 2019 he joined Atherton Collieries on a short-term contract. It was announced in August 2020 that he had signed for Stafford Rangers . On 8 October 2021, Welsh announced he was leaving Stafford and subsequently retired in order to focus on other work commitments. Coaching career In October 2021, Welsh returned to former club Preston North End as Lead Development Phase Coach. On 2 January 2026, Welsh was appointed assistant head coach of League Two club Barrow , assisting former Preston North End teammate Paul Gallagher .

{"id": "doc_random_041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Winter_Olympics_opening_ceremony", "text": "\"Sochi 2014 opening ceremony\" redirects here. For the Paralympics opening ceremony, see 2014 Winter Paralympics opening ceremony . The opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics took place at the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi, Russia, on 7 February 2014. It began at 20:14 MSK ( UTC+4 ) and finished at 23:02 MSK ( UTC+4 ). It was filmed and produced by OBS and Russian host broadcasters Channel One and VGTRK. This was the first Winter Olympics and first Olympic Games opening ceremony under the IOC presidency of Thomas Bach . This was also the second consecutive Winter Olympic opening ceremony to be held in an indoor stadium. The Games were officially opened by President Vladimir Putin . An audience of 40,000 were in attendance at the stadium with an estimated 2,000 performers. Preparations The site of the opening ceremony, Fisht Olympic Stadium was built specifically for the games. Fisht Stadium seats 40,000. No Olympic or Paralympic competitions were held there; it was only used for the opening and closing ceremonies during the respective Games. Television producer Konstantin Ernst was the main Creative Head in charge of the opening ceremonies. Andrei Nasonovsky was the Executive Producer of record; and Andrei Boltenko was the writer and director of the ceremony. A different team was in charge of the Closing Ceremony as well as the Paralympic ceremonies. Proceedings Pre-ceremony activities included performances by the Russian pop duo t.A.T.u. and the Ministry of Internal Affairs choir, who performed a version of Daft Punk 's \" Get Lucky \". Opening section Dreams of Russia The ceremony, opened with an on-screen video showing 11-year-old Liza Temnikova playing a character named Lyubov (Russian for 'love') reciting the Russian alphabet . Each letter is associated with images of a famous Russian person or landmark. Many of the letters features some of Russia's most famous writers such as Dostoyevsky, Nabokov, Tolstoy, Chekhov, and countless others that have impacted Russian history, culture, literature, and philosophy. Lyubov then flew into the air as she dreamed of grabbing the tail of a kite and being lifted far off the stage. Nine different floats, carrying Russian landscapes, passed beneath her as she slept. Five large snowflakes descended into the stadium which expanded and joined to form the Olympic rings . However, a technical error caused the fifth ring not to expand, and pyrotechnics did not go off from the rings. The mishap was later self-mocked by the organizers at the closing ceremony where one of the roundrelay dance groups symbolizing the Olympic rings \"failed\" to expand. Anthems The Sretensky Monastery men's choir sang the Russian National Anthem , while 240 volunteers stood in formation wearing glowing suits of white, red, and blue to represent the Russian flag. The Russian flag bearers were a detachment of cosmonauts \u2014 Fyodor Yurchikhin (who returned from space with the torch), Roman Romanenko , Svetlana Savitskaya and Yelena Serova \u2013 and the flag was raised by Sergei Krikalev . The volunteers moved up and down to create a waving flag motion. Parade of Nations See also: 2014 Winter Olympics Parade of Nations The Parade of Nations was led, according to custom due to hosting the original ancient Olympics , by the Greek team, followed by other competing countries in alphabetical order based on their names in the Russian language , with the host country, Russia, culminating the march. Athletes were then seated in the lower level of the stadium's stands. A projected rendering of the Earth showing each competing country (along with their names in English, French and Russian, respectively) was displayed on the stadium floor as they entered. The parade was accompanied with a soundtrack by Russian electronic dance music producer Leonid Rudenko , which featured remixes of popular Russian music . Mascots After the Parade of Nations entered, the three mascots of the Games come out and walk on an ice-based shaping rink LED of the stadium. The hare is an alpine skier, the leopard and the polar bear are the skiers using skating rink shoes. The mascots bow quickly then head off for the next segment. Performances Russian President Vladimir Putin and Irina Skvortsova (a former bobsleigh racer who received multiple injuries in Germany) at the opening of the Games The opening ceremony focused heavily on classical music and large scale productions. Performances journeyed through Russian history through the eyes of a little girl called Lyubov (\"Love\"), played by Liza Temnikova, touching on Russia's art, music, and ballet. The Russian history presentation was ushered in by a brightly-lit troika of three horses followed by a red sun. Performances included the building of St Basil's Cathedral , represented by colourful inflatable sculptures, and 17th century czar Peter the Great building an army as Russia transitioned from medieval times to the 20th century. Czar Peter's marching cadets (160 male dancers) moved from a map of the St Petersburg projected on the stadium floor to an imperial ball inspired by Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace , and featuring ballet dancers including Danila Korsuntsev, Ivan Vasiliev, and Svetlana Zakharova. The ball included music by Aleksander Sergeyevich Zatsepin and ended with the fifth movement (Rondo) of Alfred Schnittke's Concerto Grosso No. 1 . Fourteen columns rose from the floor, then disappeared, replaced first by scenes of the Russian Revolution and Soviet industrialization , followed by a giant moving reproduction of the famous statue Worker and Kolkhoz Woman made by Vera Mukhina in 1937, with hammer and sickle flying over the arena, symbolising the period of great industrialisation following the Bolshevik Revolution . Dozens of men carried rockets and the name of Yuri Gagarin appeared on the floor, followed up skyscrapers emerging against a background of modern typography. The organizing committee initially wanted to include scenes of Soviet victory in the World War Two , but the IOC protested and the plans were abandoned. Putin declared the games open, followed by a performance of Swan Lake in which the Swans, holding strands of blue LED lights, transformed into the Dove of Peace, a traditional Olympic symbol. Prima ballerina Diana Vishneva was among those who performed. Many performers wore white to symbolise peace. More than 3,000 performers and 2,000 volunteers took part in the show. 10,000 people in all helped organise and execute the ceremonies. 120 projectors and 2.6 million lumens turned the stadium floor into a 3D, moving landscape. Oath and torch lighting The Olympic flag entering the stadium. The Olympic flag was brought into the stadium with eight flag bearers: Chulpan Khamatova , Lidiya Skoblikova , Anastasia Popova , Valentina Tereshkova , Viacheslav Fetisov , Valery Gergiev , Alan Enileev and Nikita Mikhalkov . During the flag raising, opera singer Anna Netrebko later sang the Olympic Anthem in Russian. The Olympic Oath on behalf of all athletes was taken by Ruslan Zakharov (Short-track), Vyacheslav Vedenin took the oath for all judges and Anastasia Popkova took the oath for all coaches. For the finale, tennis player Maria Sharapova brought the Olympic Torch (the torch that had gone to the International Space Station in November) into the stadium. She handed it off to pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva who, in turn, passed it to wrestler Aleksandr Karelin . Karelin then passed the torch to gymnast Alina Kabaeva . Figure skater Irina Rodnina took the torch and was met by former ice hockey goalkeeper Vladislav Tretiak , handing the torch to him. Tretiak jogged out of the stadium alongside Rodnina. The pair then jointly lit the Olympic cauldron installed at the Sochi Medals Plaza in Sochi Olympic Park to the music of the \" Firebird Suite \" by Igor Stravinsky . Gas jets led the Olympic flame to the top of the Olympic Cauldron. This was followed by a fireworks display across the area around Fisht Olympic Stadium , including the other sporting venues. Twenty-two tonnes of fireworks were lit as Tchaikovsky 's Nutcracker score played. In total, the show lasted just under three hours. Music According to the Ceremony's producers, Russia is said to be a country with a feminine soul. Lyubov \"Love\" is a representation of that idea. In the Dream sequence Liza Temnikova, as Lyubov, releases her red balloon, representing the dream of an era and the hope for the future. Opening ceremony performance.

In the United States, NBC's broadcasts of the opening ceremony were delayed until evening hours. The broadcast attracted 31.7 million American viewers, compared to 32.6 million for the live telecast of the 2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony . In Britain, BBC Two 's coverage of the ceremony attracted a peak 3.2 million viewers and an average rating of 2.47 million. BBM Canada ratings for CBC 's live, repeat and online broadcasts of the ceremony totalled 6.974 million viewers. In Australia, Ten broadcast the ceremony at 3\u00a0am AEDT. Reception The Independent' s Simon Rice found some portions of the ceremony to be \"confusing\" and other \"spectacular\", while describing the cauldron lighting as \"an unimaginative domino of flames\". The New York Times review described the proceedings as \"sheer pageantry and national pride\". Katherine Monk of Canada's Postmedia News described the athletes' clothing as \"a lot sexier than the old Communist-era cardboard garb\". Kathy Lally and Will Englund of The Washington Post commented that \"The scale bordered on the colossal\" and called the ceremony \"poetry \u2013 in motion\". Despite Russia's stance on LGBT people (including its 2013 law banning the distribution of LGBT \"propaganda\" to minors , which had been a major concern leading up to the Olympics), the Huffington Post noted that the opening ceremony, ironically, featured tributes to \"some of history's most widely acclaimed and definitely gay Russians\", including composer Peter Tchaikovsky (1840\u20131893), ballet dancer Vaslav Nijinsky (1889\u20131950), and patron of arts, and founder of Ballets Russes , Sergei Diaghilev . Russian organizers denied any connection, stating that these figures were selected because of their cultural significance. On the same topic, critics also noted the Russian pop duo t.A.T.u were invited to perform during the opening ceremony; although they are not actually lesbian, the all-female duo were well known for incorporating themes of lesbianism in their music and on-stage personas (live appearances often featured the singers kissing each other), its name is a corruption of a shortened Russian phrase meaning \"this girl loves that girl\", and the duo made a statement in support of LGBT rights in the wake of Yuri Luzhkov 's objection to the 2007 Moscow Pride parade . Organizers noted that t.A.T.u were chosen because they were well known to an international audience, denying any relation to LGBT rights. Dignitaries in attendance Aside from athletes and members of the IOC , 5 multilateral leaders and representatives from more than 80 countries (included at least 60 heads of state and government ) attended the opening ceremony.

It is endemic to a small portion of the Mediterranean Sea , off the coasts of Sicily and Malta . Geiger designated this species as a synonym of Haliotis squamata Reeve, 1846 , itself considered by WoRMS as the subspecies Haliotis diversicolor squamata Reeve, 1846. Description The size of the shell varies between 21\u00a0mm and 50\u00a0mm. \"The small shell has an oval shape. The spire is subterminal. The shell is sculptured with clearly, deeply cut spiral cords and radiating folds, which on the body whorl project as little scales on the spiral lirae. The 3 to 5 subcircular holes are somewhat tubular. The right side is decidedly straighter than the left, the convexity being variable. The color of the shell is brown, variously marked with white and green. The spiral lirae are deeply cut and number 24-30 (counting along the lip edge) exclusive of 5 or 6 below the row of holes. They are crossed by numerous uneven radiating folds, those on the later part appearing as projecting lamellae across the riblets. The 5 or 6 unequal spiral cords between the row of holes and the columella are more or less beaded or scaly. The spire is small and not much elevated. Its distance from the nearest margin is one-fifth to one-seventh the total length of the shell. The interior surface is silvery and iridescent. The columellar plate is wide above, gradually narrowing and not at all truncate toward the base.\" \"The species has a very rough, sharply sculptured exterior, and .the spire-cavity is concealed by the wide columellar lip.\" Distribution This marine species occurs in the Mediterranean Sea off Sicily , Lampedusa and Malta .

Early life and marriage Pietro Loredan was born in Venice in 1481 as the third son of Alvise di Polo di Francesco Loredan, of the S. Pantalon della Frescada branch, and Isabella Barozzi di Pietro, of the S. Mois\u00e8 branch. He first married Maria Pasqualigo, and then in 1517, he married Lucrezia di Lorenzo Cappello, of the branch of S. Maria Mater Domini - the same as the famous Bianca Capello . Pietro and Lucrezia only had one son, Alvise Loredan (1521\u201393), who married Elena di Giovanni Emo and continued the lineage with numerous offspring. The fortune, real estate and land, in Venice and in the territories of Padua and Treviso , was divided by will among the numerous descendants who continued to use the ancestral residence in Rio della Frescada. Political career Coat of arms of Pietro Loredan Pietro had an intense but not necessarily prestigious career, which he accompanied with the care of commercial interests, according to family tradition. Present in 1509 and in 1510 in the defense of Padua and Treviso, he made his debut in public life in 1510 as a sopracomito . In April of 1511 he was elected a senator. He intervened in the Senate , asking for the reduction of the sum that the Jews had to pay for their \"conduct\" and ruled in favor of a league with France , also willing to sell Cremona and Ghiara d'Adda in exchange for others territories. In 1513 he left again to defend Padua and Treviso and, available for military roles, he offered to fill the positions of administrator of the Stradioti , and governor of Adria . Pietro refused his appointment as consul in Alexandria in 1516, when he intensified his entrepreneurial activity: in 1517 he, together with his brothers, armed a ship to transport pilgrims to the Holy Land , and the following year he set up a market galley on the Alexandria route. Business did not, however, distract him from public service, as evidenced by the various candidacies and the appointment in the College of the Twenty Wise Men , while his financial fortune allowed him to enter the committee of guarantors of Banco Priuli. In 1545 he was one of the nine electors of Doge Francesco Don\u00e0 ; between 1546 and 1549 he ran several times for the Council of Ten which, after another stay in the Senate, he entered at the beginning of 1550, becoming its head. Then, he became a ducal councilor for the Dorsoduro district. In the 1550s, Pietro consolidated his personal prestige: he sat assiduously in the Senate, in the Council of Ten, as well as in the Signoria as ducal councilor. In 1559 he was included among the forty-one electors of Doge Girolamo Priuli . Between 1560 and 1562 he continued to hold important positions. Portrait of Doge Pietro Loredan, by Tintoretto Dogeship Portrait of Doge Pietro Loredan, by Jacopo Tintoretto On 29 November 1567, Pietro was elected doge , which came to his surprise. \"A man of 85 years, but very prosperous\u201d, wrote of him the papal nuncio Giovanni Antonio Facchinetti, who would later become Pope Innocent IX . Considered a figure of little political importance, his dogeship was considered the most suitable because it was transitory and politically harmless. Religious and morally upright, educated, and of uncommon wisdom, Pietro, reluctant at the beginning, in the two and a half years of his reign showed recognized gifts of balance and prudence. Although it was known that he was \"of good will but little knowledge of matters of public government\", some chroniclers pointed out that if his advice were listened to in the dramatic circumstances of those years, the state would benefit. After his election, Ottoman threats against Venetian Cyprus grew more and more, so much so as to temporarily quell the disputes of a judicial nature between Venice and the Holy See . Pietro showed a strong commitment to cope with the famine that struck Venice during his reign, as well as with the fire, considered arson, which devastated the Arsenal in 1569. In the spring of 1570, the Ottomans had intensified their preparations for war against Cyprus , which Venice was preparing to defend. Death Doge Pietro Loredan Beseeching the Virgin, by Palma il Giovanne The climate of tension weakened the physique of Pietro, who, struck by illness, fell ill with a fever and died after nine days, on 3 May 1570. The news was kept hidden for a few days, \"so that the negotiators of the state do not suffer\", wrote the papal nuncio. The Senate met exceptionally, in absence of the doge, to deal with emergencies and, with an unusual procedure, hastened the appointment of his successor, Alvise I Mocenigo , who was elected on 9 May. On 7 May, the state funeral was celebrated in San Marco , instead of at Santi Giovanni e Paolo , due to bad weather. The body of Doge Pietro Loredan was carried to the cloister of S. Giobbe and buried in the family ark. Doge Pietro Loredan was portrayed in the ducal palace by Domenico Tintoretto and the painting placed in the Senate room, and by Jacopo Tintoretto for the one in the Scrutinio room.

{"id": "doc_random_045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._W._Walsh", "text": "J. W. Walsh (born June 29, 1992) is an American football coach and former player. He played quarterback for the Oklahoma State Cowboys from 2011 to 2015. Early life Walsh played at Guyer High School in Denton, Texas , where he was coached by his father John and reached the University Interscholastic League state finals his senior year. College career Walsh was redshirted as a true freshman in 2011. In 2012, Walsh battled Clint Chelf and true freshman Wes Lunt for the starting quarterback job. Lunt won the quarterback derby and Walsh was named the backup. Lunt suffered a knee/ankle injury in the game against Louisiana\u2013Lafayette on September 15. Walsh stepped in and started the next three games before suffering a knee injury against Iowa State on October 20. The injury was later revealed to be a fractured knee. The injury announcement came as a surprise as Walsh apparently suffered the injury in the first quarter, but he was able to play the entire game and finished with 415 passing yards and 46 rushing yards. The injury was expected to sideline Walsh for the rest of the season, but he was able to return only a few weeks later. He was able to suit up for the last four games of the season and backed up Chelf, who started the final five games of the season at quarterback. Walsh finished the season with 1,564 passing yards, 13 touchdowns against three interceptions, and completed 66.9 percent of his passes. He was named the Big 12 Offensive Freshman of the Year by conference coaches. In 2013, Walsh and Chelf battled for the starting quarterback spot, after Lunt decided to transfer to Illinois . On August 22, Oklahoma State head coach Mike Gundy announced that both Walsh and Chelf would play in the season opener against Mississippi State on August 31. Chelf was named the starter of the Mississippi State game only minutes before kickoff. He engineered two ineffective drives to start the game, before being replaced by Walsh, who played the rest of the game at quarterback. Oklahoma State won the game 21\u20133 and Walsh finished the game with 135 passing yards, 125 rushing yards, and completed 18-of-27 passes. After the game, Gundy announced that Walsh would be the starting quarterback going forward. Walsh started the next five games, until he was benched during the game against TCU after throwing two interceptions. He was replaced by Chelf, who started at quarterback for the rest of the season. In 2014, Walsh started the first two games of the season. In the second game of the season against Missouri State , Walsh was knocked out of the game with a right foot injury. The injury required surgical repair and Walsh would miss the remainder of the season. In January 2015, Gundy named Mason Rudolph the starting quarterback going into the 2015 season. With Rudolph as the unquestioned starting quarterback, Walsh entered the 2015 season as the backup quarterback. The coaches designed a package of plays specifically for Walsh and by fall practice, it became clear that Walsh would have a role in the offense. While Rudolph was the starter and would take the majority of snaps at quarterback, Walsh would enter the game at quarterback in short-yardage third and fourth down situations, and red-zone situations throughout the season. In the first ten games of the season, Walsh racked up 10 passing and 10 rushing touchdowns. Walsh started the regular season finale against Oklahoma in place of Rudolph, who suffered a foot injury against Baylor on November 21. Coaching career On January 19, 2016, it was reported that Walsh would be joining the TCU coaching staff as an offensive graduate assistant. On December 21, 2016, it was reported that Walsh would be joining the staff at Abilene Christian University for the 2017 season as the Running Backs coach. On March 10, 2020, it was reported that Walsh would be joining the staff at The University of Texas at Austin for the 2020 season as an offensive analyst. On January 15, 2021, it was announced that Walsh would be returning to his alma mater, Oklahoma State University, to join the staff as a Quality Control coach working directly under Quarterbacks coach Tim Rattay .

{"id": "doc_random_046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Yourself:_Her", "text": "Love Yourself: Her (stylized as LOVE YOURSELF \u627f 'Her' ) is the fifth extended play by South Korean boy group BTS . The EP was released on September 18, 2017, by Big Hit Entertainment . The album was released in four versions and contains nine tracks, with \" DNA \" as its lead single. Background Love Yourself: Her is the first album to be released since BTS revealed their new \"brand identity\" on July 4, 2017, complete with a new, simplified logo. On September 18, the album was released alongside the music video for its lead single, \"DNA\". In the 24 hours after release, the \"DNA\" music video had been viewed 21 million times, becoming the first K-pop group music video to reach over 20 million views in 24 hours. Composition Sonically, the EP served as \"a dual exploration of the group's electro-pop and hip-hop leanings,\" with the first half consisting of \"dance tracks that emphasize the group's vocals\" while in the second half \"the act's hip-hop side arrives in earnest...delivering powerful rap performances.\" \"Love Yourself\" series which sought the enlightenment of self-love through the \" \u8d77\u627f\u8f49\u7d50 \" (Korean: \uae30\uc2b9\uc804\uacb0; RR: Giseungjeongyeol ) narrative sequence of \"beginning, development, turn, and conclusion.\" In the narrative sequence, the EP represented the \"\u627f,\" or \"development\" of the series and is considered by RM to be one of the major turning points in BTS' career. Within the larger narrative, Love Yourself: Her described the joy and happiness of falling in love. Commercial performance Love Yourself: Her recorded 1,051,546 stock pre-orders from August 25\u201331, making BTS the first K-pop group to reach and cross one million pre-orders with a single album. The EP debuted at number one on the South Korean Gaon Album Chart , while its lead single \"DNA\" debuted at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart \u2014all tracks from the EP also placed in the top 40 of the chart. According to the monthly Album Chart, released on October 14, the album was the highest-selling release of September 2017, with 1,203,533 copies sold since its release on September 18. The album also had the second highest monthly sales in the history of the Gaon Chart, and was the first in 16 years to exceed 1.2 million copies sold since g.o.d 's fourth album Chapter 4 (2001). It won the grand prize at the 32nd Golden Disc Awards in the Physical Category on January 11, 2018, and went on become BTS' highest-selling album at the time, surpassing Wings (2016). It is one of the best-selling albums in Gaon Chart history, with over 2.2\u00a0million copies sold as of April 2020. The EP opened at number seven on the US Billboard 200 with 31,000 album-equivalent units \u201418,000 were pure album sales \u2014marking the biggest sales week for a K-pop album on the chart and making it the highest-charting K-pop album in Billboard chart history, until the release of BTS' own Love Yourself: Tear in 2018. BTS became the first Asian artist in seven years to debut within the top ten of the chart, surpassing the record set by Filipino singer Charice who debuted at number eight in 2010 with her eponymous American debut album . The album remained on the Billboard 200 for 44 weeks, becoming the first Korean album to do so. Following its reissue on vinyl in 2023, Love Yourself: Her sold a further 21,000 units in the country and reentered the top 20 of the Billboard 200 at number 13, on the issue dated January 21, 2023, marking its 45th non-consecutive week on the chart. It was the second best-selling album of the week overall, and the best-selling release on the format, with 18,000 pure sales, earning BTS their first number one on the Vinyl Albums chart. It also repeaked atop the World Albums chart for the same issue date. Elsewhere, the EP peaked at number one on the Oricon Albums Chart in Japan in its second week, and earned BTS their debut on the UK Albums Chart when it peaked at number 14 on the issue dated October 7, 2017. Reception Billboard writer Tamar Herman described the EP as \"a dual exploration of the group's electro-pop and hip-hop leanings\", with the first half consisting of \u201cdance tracks that emphasize the group's vocals\" while in the second half \"the act's hip-hop side arrives in earnest...delivering powerful rap performances.\" Viri Garcia of The Cornell Daily Sun commended BTS for \"trying to achieve a sound closer to pop while keeping their own signature sounds\" and succeeding in creating a \"masterpiece full of emotion and musicality that can't be paralleled by any American or Korean act.\" However, Monique Melendez from Spin summarized the album as \"thematically confident in its separate halves but musically disparate\", with the group refusing to compromise on a specific musical direction. Melendez further commented that Love Yourself \u627f 'Her' came up short compared to BTS' past works, such as Wings and The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 and Part 2 , in which \"visuals, lyrics, and sounds united under fully-realized concepts.\" The EP's lead single \"DNA\" was featured on Vulture as one of the \"8 Best New Songs of the Week\", describing the track as the \"sound of a boy band headed in a new direction plotted for crossover domination\u201c and one that \"recategorizes BTS by shrugging off genre entirely.\" The New York Times pop music critic Jon Caramanica wrote that while BTS' music often exhibits the \u201cflamboyance and sometimes manic energy\" that is characteristic of K-pop, Love Yourself: Her takes a remarkably \"tranquil approach\u201d to the genre through side tracks such as \"Pied Piper\", which he described as \"a slow disco number that's emphatic in its relaxation.\" Caramanica additionally highlighted \"Outro: Her\" as a track with a hip hop beat that is \"lush with instrumentation, and moves with a casual saunter reminiscent of the mid 1990s.\" Tamar Herman also offered praises for the lyrical delivery of \"Pied Piper\", and stated, \"A take on K-pop's rampant and highly profitable fan culture, 'Pied Piper,' is BTS doing what they do best: addressing a societal problem through their jaunty music.\" Herman called the track \"BTS' most subversive song of their career.\" Accolades Track listing The credits are adapted from the official album profile on Naver.

The tape had seven parallel tracks , six for data (called a copy group , not a character) and one to maintain parity . Tapes were recorded in odd parity, to ensure at least one bit transition per copy group as well as for error checking.

Multiple foreign diplomatic missions, including the embassies of the United States , France , Netherlands , Belgium , Rwanda , Kenya , and Uganda , became targets of civil unrest as protesters expressed their opposition to perceived international inaction regarding M23 rebel advances in eastern DRC. Background Main articles: M23 offensive (2022\u2013present) , 2025 Goma offensive , and Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2013Rwanda tensions (2022\u2013present) Protests and riots The advancement of M23 forces into Goma , the capital of North Kivu and a major regional hub with a population of two million, sparked intense public anger in Kinshasa , particularly directed at nations perceived as failing to intervene in the conflict. Protests conducted on highlighted growing tensions over the international community's response to the ongoing conflict in eastern DRC, with demonstrators specifically calling for increased pressure on Rwanda regarding its alleged support of the M23 rebels. Anger was expressed towards European and neighboring African nations' perceived hypocrisy in demanding peace while continuing to diplomatically support Rwanda, with several protesters calling them complicit in the ongoing violence and humanitarian crisis. During the demonstrations, protesters targeted multiple diplomatic facilities in Kinshasa. The most significant damage occurred at the embassies of France , Rwanda , and Belgium , where demonstrators engaged in acts of vandalism and arson , setting fires to portions of the diplomatic compounds. The Kenyan and Ugandan diplomatic missions were also targeted during the unrest. Protesters burned tires in the streets and engaged in direct confrontations with security forces. In a security alert, the U.S. Embassy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported that large crowds were throwing rocks, attacking vehicles, setting up roadblocks, and setting small fires amid the unrest. In addition, local markets and supermarkets were looted across the city. Response Law enforcement responded to the situation by deploying tear gas and firing warning shots to disperse the crowds. The DRC's Minister of Communications Patrick Muyaya Katembwe addressed the situation on national television, calling for peaceful demonstrations and urging protesters to respect diplomatic infrastructure. The US Embassy issued guidance to its citizens, recommending they shelter in place before seeking safe departure from the country while commercial travel options remained available. The embassy specifically warned about potential roadblocks and protests affecting routes to airports. Reactions The European Union issued a formal condemnation of the embassy attacks, with a spokesperson for EU Foreign Affairs Chief Kaja Kallas emphasizing the necessity of protecting diplomatic missions under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations . Foreign Minister of France Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot specifically addressed the attack on France's embassy, declaring the actions \"unacceptable\" and assuring that measures were being implemented to protect diplomatic personnel and citizens. Kenya's Prime Cabinet Secretary and Minister of Foreign and Diaspora Affairs Musalia Mudavadi issued a statement expressing deep concern over the attacks on their embassy offices and personnel, characterizing the incidents as grave violations of international law.

{"id": "doc_random_050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._E._Marsh", "text": "Douglas Earle Marsh (1862\u20131933) was an English railway engineer, and was the Locomotive, Carriage and Wagon Superintendent of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway from November 1904 until his early retirement on health grounds in July 1911. Early career Marsh was born at Aylsham , Norfolk on 4 January 1862, and was educated at Brighton College and University College London . He worked for the Great Western Railway under William Dean becoming an Assistant Works Manager at Swindon in 1888. In 1896 he became Chief Assistant Mechanical Engineer of the Great Northern Railway at Doncaster railway works under H.A. Ivatt , where he participated in the design of the Ivatt Atlantics . LB&SCR Marsh succeeded R. J. Billinton as the Locomotive, Carriage and Wagon Superintendent at Brighton Works on 23 November 1904. Marsh's locomotive classes included two designs of Atlantic 4-4-2 ( H1 Class and H2 Class ), and four designs of 4-4-2 T ( I1 , I2 , I3 , and I4 ). In 1910 he designed two 4-6-2T tank locomotives of the J1 and J2 classes . His least successful design was the LB&SCR C3 class 0-6-0 freight locomotives. Marsh also rebuilt many of his predecessors' locomotives with larger boilers thereby creating the A1X , B2X , C2X , E4X , E5X and E6X classes. In 1907 he introduced an example of the Schmidt superheater on one of his LB&SCR I3 class locomotives, with dramatically improved results. Whilst at Brighton he abolished the Stroudley yellow livery for passenger locomotives and removed the names from them. During Marsh's period in office Brighton railway works built up a serious backlog of locomotives awaiting repair, and by 1910 30% of the locomotive stock was unusable. Marsh received much of the blame for this, although it was partly because the works was overwhelmed at the time. Resignation and retirement Marsh was never popular within the workforce at Brighton. He resigned on the grounds of deteriorating health in July 1911, following accusations of a number of irregularities in his accounting. Shortly after his resignation he became a consulting engineer for the Rio Tinto Company until 1932. He died in Bath in May 1933.

{"id": "doc_random_051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heyington_railway_station", "text": "Heyington station is a railway station operated by Metro Trains Melbourne on the Glen Waverley line , which is part of the Melbourne rail network . It serves the eastern suburb of Toorak , in Melbourne , Victoria, Australia. Heyington station is a ground level staffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 24 March 1890, with the current station provided in 1975. The station does not have any transport connections unlike the majority of Melbourne train stations. The journey to Southern Cross railway station is approximately 7.12 kilometres (4.42\u00a0mi) and takes 25 minutes. Description The footbridge with stair only access Heyington railway station located in the suburb of Toorak, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. North of the station is the Yarra River and east of the station is St Kevin's College . The station is owned by VicTrack , a state government agency, and the station is operated by Metro Trains . The station is 7.12 kilometres (4.42\u00a0mi), or a 15-minute train journey, from Southern Cross station . The adjacent stations are Burnley station up towards Melbourne, and Kooyong station down towards Glen Waverley . The station consists of two side platforms two platform edges. Standard in Melbourne, the platform has an asphalt surface with concrete on the edges. The platforms are approximately 160 metres (524\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) long, enough for a Metro Trains 7-car HCMT . The station features one main station building, located on platform 1. This building acts as toilet, automated ticketing, and PSO facilities. The station building is made from wood and ribbed metal roofing. The station building, concourse, and platform are largely the same as when the station was rebuilt in 1975. There is no bike or car parking are available at the station. The station is the only one in Melbourne accessed solely by stairs, with both platforms requiring stair access from the pedestrian footbridge. History Heyington railway station was opened on 24 March 1890 with the line through the station originally built to link Burnley to the Outer Circle line at Waverley Road , before continuing onto Oakleigh . The station was named after nearby Heyington Place, which provides access to the station. The line underwent numerous extensions over its life, with extensions to East Malvern in 1929 and to Glen Waverley in 1930. In 1926, duplication of the line between Heyington and Burnley stations occurred, with duplication between Heyington and Kooyong stations occurring in 1955. Duplication of the line to Darling occurred in 1956, with the line fully duplicated to Glen Waverley by 1964. In 1969, the current overpass , located just beyond the up end of the station, was provided. In 1975, the current station building on Platform 1 was provided, with parcel facilities also being abolished around this time. On 23 June 1979, the new station building was partially damaged by fire. Minor upgrades have occurred at the station since 1975, with a new roof installed on the Platform 1 station structure in 2022 and other technological, safety, and signage upgrades. February 2014 fatality The station platforms in the setup that they were in at the time of the accident, 2007 On 22 February 2014, an 18 year old male was fatally injured when he fell between a moving train and the platform. He was running alongside the moving train when he fell attempting to board it, while passengers inside the train were forcibly holding the carriage doors open. An Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) report found that due to the pressure applied by passengers, the traction interlock system (as designed) automatically deactivated after a period of time. This allowed traction to be applied and the train to depart with the carriage doors open. Large platform gaps as a result of platform curvature also contributed to the accident. The report found a total of four main issues, those being the inadequacy of the doors open warning device, the standards for train and platform clearances, the ability for the train to move with the carriage doors open, and the platform clearances. In a bid to prevent further fatalities from arising, Metro Trains Melbourne (MTM) has realigned the track at Heyington station and installed rubber \"bridges\" along the entire edge of the platform face. Furthermore, a barrier has also been installed at the platform entrance to deter passengers from running for the train. On the wider network, MTM has also completed a survey of all stations with curved track and platforms that are at a higher risk of an issue occurring. In the short term, these platforms have had \u2018Mind the Gap\u2019 signs painted on them with the addition of announcement to alert passengers of the presence of a gap. In the long term, plans and strategies have been adopted to remove these safety issues permanently from the network. Platforms and services Heyington has two side platforms with two faces. The station is currently served by the Glen Waverley line\u2014a service on the metropolitan rail network. The Glen Waverley line runs from Glen Waverley station south east of Melbourne, joining the Belgrave , Lilydale , and Alamein lines at Burnley station before travelling through the city loop . Transport links Rare amongst Melbourne train stations, Heyington station has no other transport connections. There are some transport connections on Toorak Road, however, these are over 200 metres (220\u00a0yd) away from the station. Heyington station does however have train replacement bus stops located adjacent to the station.

{"id": "doc_random_054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_style", "text": "Liberty style ( Italian : stile Liberty [\u02c8sti\u02d0le \u02c8li\u02d0berti] ) was the Italian variant of Art Nouveau , which flourished between about 1890 and 1914. It was also sometimes known as stile floreale (\"floral style\"), arte nuova (\"new art\"), or stile moderno (\"modern style\" not to be confused with the Spanish variant of Art Nouveau which is Art Nouveau in Madrid ). It took its name from Arthur Lasenby Liberty and the store he founded in 1874 in London, Liberty Department Store , which specialized in importing ornaments, textiles and art objects from Japan and the Far East. Major Italian designers using the style included Ernesto Basile , Ettore De Maria Bergler , Vittorio Ducrot, Carlo Bugatti , Raimondo D'Aronco , Eugenio Quarti , and Galileo Chini . Liberty style was especially popular in large cities outside of Rome (the capital) which were eager to establish a distinct cultural identity, particularly Milan , Palermo and Turin , the city where the first major exposition of the style in Italy was held in 1902. This marked a major event and featured works of both Italian designers and other Art Nouveau designers from around Europe. Liberty style, like other versions of Art Nouveau, had the ambition of turning ordinary objects, such as chairs and windows, into works of art. Unlike the French and Belgian Art Nouveau, based primarily on nature, Liberty style was more strongly influenced by the Baroque style, with very lavish ornament and color, both on the interior and exterior. The Italian poet and critic Gabriele d'Annunzio wrote in 1889, as the style was just beginning, \"the genial sensual debauche of the Baroque sensibility is one of the determining variants of the Italian Art Nouveau.\" Liberty style is considered to be a western offshoot of the 19th-century British Arts and Crafts movement , which was a response against the mechanization and dehumanizing of the artistic process. Palermo in the late 1800s The first examples of the liberty style in Italy are found in Palermo , in particular Villa Favaloro, and in the large building of Teatro Massimo and in its square with kiosks in this style dating back to the end of the nineteenth century. In particular, two architects were the first representatives of this new style: Giovan Battista Filippo Basile and his son Ernesto Basile . Liberty kiosk dating 1894, is located in Piazza Verdi in front of the Teatro Massimo in Palermo Villa Favaloro was built in 1889 in liberty style by Giovan Battista Filippo Basile in Palermo Villino Favaloro, Liberty decoration of the entrance door to the loggia, in Palermo The 1902 Turin Exposition Main article: Prima Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa Moderna The 1902 Turin Exposition, formally titled, Torino 1902: Le Arti Decorative Internazionali Del Nuovo Secolo , was the signature event of the style. It included designers from the United States, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, England, France, Holland, Norway, Austria, Scotland, Sweden and Hungary. Those displaying their works included Victor Horta , the pioneer Art Nouveau architect and furniture designer from Brussels. who displayed rooms with sets of furniture. Postcard of the 1902 Turin Exposition Poster for the 1902 Turin Exposition by Leonardo Bistolfi (1902) Art Nouveau furniture by Victor Horta displayed at Turin Exposition (1902) Furniture and interior design The Liberty style in interior design and furniture had three distinct tendencies. The first was very floral and sculptural, following the model of England and France. The major designers in this style were Vittorio Valebrega and Agostino Lauro, and particularly the furniture manufacturer Valabrega, which produced works in series. A second tendency was more discrete, and was similar to designs of the British Arts and Crafts movement, with linear forms, simplicity, and artisanal quality. The major designers in this school were Ernesto Basile and Giacomo Cometti . The third tendency was for forms that were much more original and exotic, often derived from the styles of North Africa and the Middle East. These works were The most influential designer in this style was Carlo Bugatti , a member of a large family of artists and father of Ettore Bugatti , the automobile designer. His works first reached international attention at the 1902 Turin Exposition. His furniture was thoroughly original, having little or no reference to other European versions of Art Nouveau. He used an extremely wide range of materials in his furniture, including ivory and rare woods. He was particularly fond of the keyhole form. His cobra chair, was inspired by the chairs of African chieftains, and was made of tropical woods, painted parchment and hammered copper. Bugatti's theory was that any object, no matter what its function, could be transformed into a work of art. An unusual example of the theory that anything could be made into a work of art is the statue of dancing elephant by Rembrandt Bugatti , the son of Carlo Bugatti, in 1908. In 1928, in a version made of silver, it was turned into a radiator cap for the Bugatti Royale automobile. Another notable designer of Liberty style furniture was Eugenio Quarti , who had won a prize at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900 . He apprenticed in Paris and worked for a time in the studio of Carlo Bugatti , but soon departed from Bugatti's exoticism and worked in a more classical style. He used traditional fine woods, such as mahogany and walnut , combined with inlays of ivory, and brass, glass, and other modern elements.

Pietro Fenoglio was one of the early figures in Liberty style architecture, with the Casa Fenoglio-Lafleur in Turin , which added Art Nouveau elements onto a more traditional facade. In Palermo the major figure was Ernesto Basile , who used curved forms similar to the Belgian-French Art Nouveau combined with symbolist murals, as in the Grand Hotel Villa Igiea (1899\u20131900). Basile also combined elements of a medieval castle with Liberty decoration to create the Villino Florio in Palermo (1899\u20131902). Milan had a large number of Liberty style houses. The most prominent architects included Giovanni Battista Bossi , whose Casa Galimberti had a facade drenched with decorative sculpture and murals. The decoration seemed to have been poured over the building. The sculpture somewhat recalls the work of the Renaissance painter Giuseppe Archimboldo .

One example is found in Livorno in the decoration of the thermal baths at Acque della Salute. The frescos were painted by Ernesto Bellandi (1842-1916). Painted interiors were a speciality of Ernesto Basile of Palermo, an architect devoted special attention to the fusion of the architecture decoration in the interiors. He created a series of villas around Palermo between 1899 and 1901. Interior decoration in the Liberty style continued longer in Italy than in other parts of Europe. An example is the decoration of interiors by Galileo Chini on the themes of autumn and spring, painted in 1922 for the Terme Berzieri in Salsomaggiore . Salon of the Grand Hotel Villa Igiea in Palermo by Ernesto Basile (1899-1900), with symbolist murals Frescos at the Thermal Baths in Livorno by Ernesto Bellandi Autumn and Spring frescoes by Galileo Chini in Salsomaggiore (1922) Glass and ceramics Glass and ceramics were important components of the Liberty style. Italian glass art particularly drew upon the tradition of Murano glass , from Venice. Galileo Chini was the dominant figure in glassware and ceramics. He created decorative floral designs which were produced in stained glass, majolica or ceramics. In 1897 he founded the Florentine Society of Ceramic Arts, and between 1902 and 1914 he decorated the salons of the Venice Biennale . He also became the chair of the department of decoration in the Italian Academy of Fine Arts. He was called to Bangkok in 1911\u201313 to decorate the throne room of the royal palace there. Later works by Chini, with more geometric rather than natural designs, showed the growing influence of the more geometric style of the Vienna Secession and the work of Gustav Klimt . Vase by Fratelli Toso (about 1910) with more geometric floral style Ceramic tile decoration by Galileo Chini , with influence of Vienna Secession Polychrome majolica ceramic vase from the workshop of Galileo Chini (1906-1911) Graphic arts As in France and other parts of Europe, the poster and other graphic arts was an important genre of the Liberty style, particularly for travel posters. Leonetto Cappiello was an important figure in the early style, though he moved to Paris and spent most of his career designing posters and graphics there. Leonardo Bistolfi designed the poster for the 1902 Exposition in Turin , with the combination of feminine and floral themes typical of the early style. In its later years, the Liberty Style in graphics and painting moved away from floral and feminine themes to more modernist subjects, under the influence of Futurism . The painter and graphic artist Umberto Boccioni became one of the major figures in Futurism.

He was one of the most renowned land snail experts of his time and had earned a reputation for his comprehensive revisions of mainly terrestrial pulmonates . He worked on land snails from all regions of the world but became particularly known for his revisions of land snails from Australasia and various Pacific Islands. His 140 academic papers dealt with the snail phylogeny , feeding patterns and reproductive strategies. He named many taxa , amongst them about 350 species of Australian land snails, and several genera. Some species named by him are: Ba humbugi Solem, 1983 \u2013 a species of Fijian land snail Hadra wilsoni Solem, 1979 \u2013 a species of Western Australian land snail Glyptorhagada janaslini Solem, 1992 \u2013 a species of land snail Aaadonta fuscozonata depressa Solem, 1976 \u2013 a subspecies of land snail Taxa described by Solem Aslintesta Solem, 1992 Caperantrum Solem, 1997 Carinotrachia Solem, 1985 Cooperconcha Solem, 1992 Cristilabrum Solem, 1981 Falspleuroxia Solem, 1997 Kendrickia Solem, 1985 Melostrachia Solem, 1979 Mesodontrachia Solem, 1985 Micromelon Solem, 1992 Minimelon Solem, 1993 Montanomelon Solem, 1993 Mouldingia Solem, 1984 Ningbingia Solem, 1981 Orangia Solem, 1976 Ordtrachia Solem, 1984 Promonturconchum Solem, 1997 Prototrachia Solem, 1984 Prymnbriareus Solem, 1981 Pseudcupedora Solem, 1992 Retroterra Solem, 1985 Strepsitaurus Solem, 1997 Tatemelon Solem, 1993 Turgenitubulus Solem, 1981 Vatusila Solem, 1983 Bibliography Solem, A. 1955.

{"id": "doc_random_056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percival_P.74", "text": "The Percival P.74 (later Hunting Percival P.74 ) was a British experimental helicopter designed in the 1950s that was based on the use of tip-jet powered rotors . Although innovative, the tip-rotor concept literally failed to get off the ground in the P.74, doomed by its inadequate power source. Rather than being modified, the P.74 was towed off the airfield and scrapped. Design and development In 1951, Percival Aircraft Company formed a helicopter division, and began design work on a medium-sized helicopter designated P.74. They designed the helicopter to meet Air Ministry Specification EH.125D issued in May 1952 for an experimental helicopter to test jet driven rotors. This experimental helicopter had a teardrop-shaped fuselage with a two-seat cockpit in the nose and a large cabin that ran the full length of the fuselage. Beneath the cabin floor, two Napier Oryx gas generators fed compressed air to the tips of the three rotor blades through triple ejector ducts. The rotor blades used ailerons on the trailing edges with pitch control achieved by a screw jack . The unusual engine location required that exhaust pipes pass through the cabin wall between the rows of seats. This created excessive noise and heat for intended passengers. The lack of a gearbox and the simplified rotor coupling to the aircraft meant that the design could employ a tilting rotor hub , and did not need drag hinges . The low torque coupling at the mast meant that very little was needed in the form of lateral control. The P.74 rotor was expected to be quieter in operation than tip jets, following tests with a Derwent engine powered rotor. The stainless-steel rotors were thick in cross section to accommodate the necessary ducting to the tips. They also were non-feathering , so ailerons were fitted to the blades. The P.74 prototype (designated the Hunting Percival P.74 after the company change its name in 1954) was completed in the spring of 1956, and given the military serial number XK889 . The final product looked decidedly ungainly, with a large bulbous fuselage that tapered to a tiny \"tailcone\" with an equally tiny tail rotor (deemed sufficient for control since there was no torque from the tip-rotors). The undercarriage consisted of four wheels on splayed-out stubs with castoring for the front two wheels. The large capacity of the P.74 was to show the possible commercial aspect. A larger commercial variant, the 10-passenger Percival P.105, with stub wing mounted engines either side of the rotor mast was envisaged, and the P.74 was expected to offer information into the necessary ducting required hence the engine was mounted underneath the fuselage with ducts running up through the cabin. Testing and evaluation Hunting Percival P.74 c. 1956 Ground testing in a static rig commenced in 1956, but the Oryx engines failed to develop full power and maximum gas flow. Even with modifications to the power units, the first flight was aborted when the P.74 failed to fly. This may have been providential as there were no escape provisions for the two pilots. The only entrance door was located at the rear on the port side. The primary test pilot was famously quoted as saying the hapless P.74 had, \"...the cockpit, flying controls and engine controls... designed without any input from a pilot.\" The designers planned to fit a more powerful Rolls-Royce RB108 turbine, and a further development of a 10-passenger (P.105) variant was on the \"drawing boards\" when the nationalisation of the helicopter industry later that year resulted in the P.74 project being cancelled and the prototype scrapped. Variants P.74 Experimental helicopter with a rotor powered by two Napier Oryx gas generators, one built but failed to fly and was scrapped. P.104 Proposed variant with non-laminar-flow rotor blades, not built. P.105 Proposed improved variant with the Oryx generators moved above the cabin, not built P.113 Proposed improved variant of the P.74 with a Rolls-Royce RB108 engine and redesigned rotor system, not built.

{"id": "doc_random_057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_Foote", "text": "Shelby Dade Foote Jr. (November 17, 1916 \u2013 June 27, 2005) was an American writer and journalist. Although he primarily viewed himself as a novelist, he is now best known for his authorship of The Civil War: A Narrative , a three-volume history of the American Civil War . With geographic and cultural roots in the Mississippi Delta , Foote's life and writing paralleled the radical shift from the agrarian planter system of the Old South to the Civil Rights era of the New South . Foote was little known to the general public until his appearance in Ken Burns 's PBS documentary The Civil War in 1990, where he introduced a generation of Americans to a war that he believed was \"central to all our lives.\" Foote did all his writing by hand with a nib pen , later transcribing the result into a typewritten copy. While Foote's work was mostly well-received during his lifetime, it has been criticized by professional historians and academics in the 21st century. Early life Foote was born in Greenville, Mississippi , the son of Shelby Dade Foote and his wife Lillian (n\u00e9e Rosenstock). Foote's paternal grandfather, Huger Lee Foote (1854\u20131915) was a planter who gambled away most of his assets. His paternal great-grandfather was Hezekiah William Foote (1813\u20131899), an American Confederate veteran, attorney, planter and politician from Mississippi . His maternal grandfather was a Jewish immigrant from Vienna . Foote was raised in his father's Episcopal faith. He also sometimes attended synagogue as a child, but says he \"never felt Jewish.\" Foote moved frequently as his father was promoted within Armour and Company , living in Greenville, Jackson , and Vicksburg , Mississippi; Pensacola, Florida ; and Mobile, Alabama . When Foote was five, his father died in Mobile, and his mother moved them back to Greenville. When Foote was 15 years old, he began lifelong friendships with Walker Percy and his brothers. Foote and Percy influenced each other greatly. Additional influences on Foote's writing were Tacitus , Thucydides , Gibbon and Proust . At Greenville High School , Foote edited the student newspaper, The Pica, and frequently used it to lampoon the school's principal, who in turn exacted revenge by recommending that the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill not admit Foote in 1935. Foote was able to gain admission only by passing a round of admission tests. In 1936, Foote was initiated in the Alpha Delta chapter of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. He often skipped class to explore the library, even spending a night among the shelves. He began contributing pieces of fiction to Carolina Magazine, UNC's award-winning literary journal. Foote returned to Greenville in 1937, where he worked in construction and for a local newspaper, the Delta Democrat Times . During Foote's time at Chapel Hill, his Jewish heritage led to discrimination, an experience that bolstered his later support for the Civil Rights Movement. In 1940, Foote joined the Mississippi National Guard and was commissioned as captain of artillery . His battalion was deployed to Northern Ireland in 1943. The following year, Foote was charged with falsifying a government document relating to the check-in of a vehicle he borrowed to visit his girlfriend in Belfast . He was court-martialed and dismissed from the service. Foote got a job with the Associated Press in New York City. In January 1945, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps but was discharged as a private in November 1945 without seeing combat. Foote returned to Greenville and took a job with a local radio station. He spent most of his time writing and submitted part of his first novel to The Saturday Evening Post . When the Post published \"Flood Burial\" in 1946, Foote earned $750 and quit his job to write full-time. Novels Foote's first novel, Tournament (1949), was inspired by his planter grandfather, who died two years before the author's birth. For his next novel, Follow Me Down (1950), Foote drew on the proceedings of a Greenville murder trial he attended in 1941. Love in a Dry Season (1951) was his attempt to deal with the \"upper classes of the Mississippi Delta\" around the time of the Great Depression. Foote often expressed great affection for this novel. In Shiloh (1952), Foote developed his use of historical narrative to tell the story of the bloodiest battle in American history to that point. The narrative is presented by 17 characters: Confederate soldiers Metcalf, Dade, and Polly and Union soldiers Fountain and Flickner, with each of the 12 named soldiers in the Indiana squad given one section of that chapter. The novel quickly sold 6,000 copies and was praised by critics. The book does showcase Foote's Southern chauvinism, as the author \"favored the South throughout the novel, portraying the Confederate cause as a fight for constitutional liberty and omitting any reference to slavery.\" Letter from Foote to childhood friend Grant Stockdale (1962) Jordan County: A Landscape in Narrative (1954) is a collection of novellas, short stories, and sketches from Foote's mythical Mississippi county. September, September (1978) is the story of three white Southerners who kidnap the 8-year-old son of a wealthy African American, told against the backdrop of Memphis in September 1957. Foote struggled to write realistic African-American characters. Writing black characters for the novel \"scared the hell out of\" him, and he particularly struggled with the novel's wealthy Theo Wiggins. Foote told Walker Percy the character was one of \"those bourgeois negroes, and I never really knew a single bourgeois nigger in my life.\" Although he was not one of America's best-known fiction writers, Foote was admired by peers like Eudora Welty and his literary hero William Faulkner . The latter once told a University of Virginia class that Foote \"shows promise, if he'll just stop trying to write Faulkner, and will write some Shelby Foote.\" Foote's fiction was recommended by both The New Yorker and critics from The New York Times Book Review . History Foote moved to Memphis, Tennessee in 1952. He worked on an epic called Two Gates to the City that he had begun outlining in 1951. He was struggling with the \"dark, horrible novel\" when Bennett Cerf of Random House asked Foote to write a short history of the Civil War. Cerf was impressed with the factual accuracy and rich detail of Shiloh , and he wanted to capitalize on the centenary of the war. Cerf offered him a contract for a work of approximately 200,000 words. Foote worked for several weeks on an outline and decided that Cerf's specifications were too small. He requested the project be expanded to three volumes of 5\u2013600,000 words each. He estimated it would take nine years. It took twenty. The finished work ran to 3000 pages and was titled The Civil War: A Narrative . The individual volumes are Fort Sumter to Perryville (1958), Fredericksburg to Meridian (1963), and Red River to Appomattox (1974). Foote had no training as a historian. He visited battlefields and read widely: standard biographies, campaign studies, and recent books by Hudson Strode , Bruce Catton , James G. Randall , Clifford Dowdey , T. Harry Williams , Kenneth M. Stampp and Allan Nevins . He also mined the primary sources in the 128-volume Official Records of the War of the Rebellion . He developed new respect for such disparate figures as Ulysses S. Grant , William T. Sherman , Patrick Cleburne , Edwin Stanton , and Jefferson Davis . By contrast, he grew to dislike such figures as Philip Sheridan and Joseph E. Johnston . Foote described himself as a \"novelist-historian\" who employed \"the historian\u2019s standards without his paraphernalia\" and \"employed the novelist\u2019s methods without his license.\" To heighten the storytelling of his book, Foote eschewed footnotes. Citations would have \"totally shattered what I was doing. I didn't want people glancing down at the bottom of the page every other sentence.\" Foote concluded most historians are \"so concerned with finding out what happened that they make the enormous mistake of equating facts with truth...you can't get the truth from facts. The truth is the way you feel about it.\" During the project, Foote lived off two Guggenheim Fellowships (1955\u20131960), Ford Foundation grants, and loans from Walker Percy. Reception Many reviews of The Civil War: A Narrative praised its style. Southern historian C. Vann Woodward argued Foote's work was acceptable \"narrative history,\" which \"nonprofessionals have all but taken over.\" The gradual withering of the narrative impulse in favor of the analytical urge among professional academic historians has resulted in a virtual abdication of the oldest and most honored role of the historian, that of storyteller. Having abdicated...the professional is in a poor position to patronize amateurs who fulfill the needed function he has abandoned...In no field is the abdication of the professionals more evident than in military history, the strictly martial, guns-and-battle aspect of war, the most essential aspect. Foote was criticized for his lack of interest in more current historical research, and for a less firm grasp of politics than of military affairs. John F. Marszalek praised Foote's grasp of military history, \"Twenty years of dedicated labor have resulted in a literary masterpiece which places Shelby Foote among those very few historians who are authors of major syntheses...this history will long stand with the volumes of Bruce Catton as the final word on the military history of the Civil War.\" In 1993, Richard N. Current argued that Foote too often depended on a single source for lifelike details, but \"probably is as accurate as most historians...Foote's monumental narrative most likely will continue to be read and remembered as a classic of its kind.\" Academic historians routinely lament Foote's lack of citations. Eric Foner and Leon Litwack felt Foote underplayed the extent of Southern white racism, treating \"white southerners\" as synonymous with all \"southerners.\" Litwack concluded that \"Foote is an engaging battlefield guide, a master of the anecdote, and a gifted and charming story teller, but he is not a good historian.\" Foote's biographer concluded, \"at its best, Foote's writing dramatised tensions related to racial and regional identity. At its worst, it fell back on the social prescriptions of Southern paternalism.\" Lost Cause Many critics read Foote as sympathetic to the Lost Cause of the Confederacy myth. He relied extensively on the work of Hudson Strode , whose sympathy for Lost Cause claims resulted in a portrait of Jefferson Davis as a tragic hero without many of the flaws attributed to him by other historians.\" Annette Gordon-Reed suggested Foote's work is powered by romantic nostalgia and bears \"the very strong mark of memory as opposed to history...the memories of that war which grew up with many white Southern males of his generation, are what power the narrative.\" Chandra Manning suggests Foote belongs to a school of Civil War historiography that \"answers 'where does slavery fit in the Union cause' by saying 'nowhere,' except maybe in the most reluctant and instrumental way.\" Joshua M. Zeitz described Foote as \"living proof that many Americans...remain under the spell of a century-old tendency to mystify the Confederacy's martial glory at the expense of recalling the intense ideological purpose associated with its cause...we remain very much under the spell of Robert E. Lee , even as we decry slavery and its legacy.\" In a 1997 interview, Foote stated that he would have fought for the Confederacy, \"What's more, I would fight for the Confederacy today if the circumstances were similar...States' rights is not just a theoretical excuse for oppressing people. You have to understand that the raggedy Confederate soldier who owned no slaves and probably couldn't even read the Constitution, let alone understand it, when he was captured by Union soldiers and asked, 'What are you fighting for?' replied, 'I'm fighting because you're down here.' So I certainly would have fought to keep people from invading my native state.\" Foote saw slavery as a cause of the Civil War, commenting that \"the people who say slavery had nothing to do with the war are just as wrong as the people who say it had everything to do with the war.\" He argued slavery was \"doomed to extinction\" and was used as \"propaganda.\" He insisted, \"no soldier on either side gave a damn about the slaves\u2014they were fighting for other reasons entirely in their minds.\" Praise of Nathan Bedford Forrest Foote kept Nathan Bedford Forrest 's portrait on his wall and lauded him as \"one of the most attractive men who ever walked through the pages of history.\" He dismissed Forrest's role in the Fort Pillow Massacre . He suggested the general had tried to prevent the massacre, despite evidence to the contrary. Foote also compared Forrest to John Keats and Abraham Lincoln . Foote argued, \" the French Maquis did far worse things than the Ku Klux Klan ever did\u2014who never blew up trains or burnt bridges or anything else,\" and that the First Klan \"didn't even have lynchings.\" In 1986, Foote strongly denounced the NAACP 's campaign to remove the Nathan Bedford Forrest Monument in Memphis, \"the day that black people admire Forrest as much as I do is the day when they will be free and equal, for they will have gotten prejudice out of their minds as we whites are trying to get it out of ours.\" Civil War historian Harold Holzer dismissed Foote's characterization of Forrest as \"one of the great geniuses of the war\" along with Lincoln, \"Ken Burns always looks for varied voices and...characters, and Shelby Foote was certainly a character.... Foote somehow compared the great emancipator with a man who owned slaves, murdered blacks and joined the Ku Klux Klan .\" Views Foote abhorred slavery, and believed emancipation was insufficient to address it: \"The institution of slavery is a stain on this nation's soul that will never be cleansed. It is just as wrong as wrong can be, a huge sin.... There's a second sin that's almost as great and that's emancipation.... There should have been a huge program for schools. There should have been all kinds of employment provided for them...there should have been some earnest effort to prepare these people for citizenship. They were not prepared, and operated under horrible disadvantages once the army was withdrawn, and some of the consequences are very much with us today.\" Foote condemned the Freedmen's Bureau , which \"did, perhaps, some good work, but it was mostly a joke, corrupt in all kinds of ways.\" Foote supported the civil rights movement , arguing in 1968 that \"the main problem facing the white, upper-class South is to decide whether or not the negro is a man...if he is a man, as of course he is, then the negro is entitled to the respect an honorable man will automatically feel to an equal.\" Foote retained complex, patriarchal and sympathetic views of African Americans and race relations. He called his native Southern culture \"perhaps the most racist society in the United States.\" However, he believed his knowledge of the South meant he understood African-Americans like Nat Turner better than Northern African-American intellectuals did: \"I think that I am closer to Nat Turner than James Baldwin is.... I consider somebody out of Harlem to be very different from someone out of Tidewater Virginia .\" Speaking in 1989, Foote stated that \"this black separatist movement is a bunch of junk,\" believing that African-Americans should model themselves on Jews, who Foote believed had a talent for making money. Foote, however, believed \"the odds against\" black people were to be \"too great\" for them to succeed in the US, as a result of \"having a different color skin.\" While writing his history of the war in the 1950s and 1960s, Foote was a liberal on racial issues. He supported school integration, opposed Eisenhower's hands-off approach to Southern racism, and championed Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. Foote protested against the KKK's use of the Confederate battle flag, believing 'that everything they stood for was almost exactly the opposite of everything the Confederacy had stood for'. Nonetheless, Foote felt the battle flag should still be flown because it \"represents many noble things.\" Later life After finishing September, September , Foote resumed work on Two Gates to the City , the novel he had set aside in 1954 to write the Civil War trilogy. The work still gave him trouble and he set it aside once more, in the summer of 1978, to write \"Echoes of Shiloh,\" an article for National Geographic Magazine . By 1981, he had given up on Two Gates altogether, though he told interviewers for years afterward that he continued to work on it. He served on the Naval Academy Advisory Board in the 1980s. In the late 1980s, Ken Burns had assembled a group of consultants to interview for his Civil War documentary. Foote was not in this initial group, though Burns had Foote's trilogy on his reading list. A phone call from Robert Penn Warren prompted Burns to contact Foote. Burns and crew traveled to Memphis in 1986 to film an interview with Foote in the anteroom of his study. In November 1986, Foote figured prominently at a meeting of dozens of consultants gathered to critique Burns' script. Burns interviewed Foote on-camera in Memphis and Vicksburg in 1987. That same year, he became a charter member of the Fellowship of Southern Writers at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga . The Civil War historian Judkin Browning has noted that Foote's outspoken praise of Nathan Bedford Forrest in the documentary ensured \"Lost Causers raised their beer mugs in salute while historians hurled their lagers at their televisions.\" Foote has been further criticized for repeating \"plainly wrong\" Lost Cause tropes in his commentary, particularly over the issue of apparently \"overwhelming\" Northern industrial advantage and his downplaying of the role of slavery in causing the Civil War. The extent of Foote's apparent apologia for white Southern racism and Lost Cause mythologizing was satirized in the character of Sherman Hoyle in the 2004 mockumentary C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America , a character defined by his \"consistent lamenting of and apologies for the good ole days.\" Foote professed to be a reluctant celebrity. When The Civil War was first broadcast, his telephone number was publicly listed and he received many phone calls from people who had seen him on television. Foote never unlisted his number, and the volume of calls increased each time the series re-aired. Many Memphis natives were known to pay Foote a visit at his East Parkway residence in Midtown Memphis. Horton Foote , the playwright and screenwriter ( To Kill A Mockingbird , Baby the Rain Must Fall and Tender Mercies ) was the voice of Jefferson Davis in the PBS series. The two Footes are third cousins; their great-grandfathers were brothers. \"And while we didn't grow up together, we have become friends; I was the voice of Jefferson Davis in that TV series,\" Horton Foote added proudly. In 1992, Foote received an honorary doctorate from the University of North Carolina. In the early 1990s, Foote was interviewed by journalist Tony Horwitz for a project on American memory of the Civil War that Horwitz eventually published as Confederates in the Attic (1998). Foote was also a member of The Modern Library 's editorial board for the re-launch of the series in the mid-1990s; this series published two books excerpted from his Civil War narrative. Foote also contributed a long introduction to their edition of Stephen Crane 's The Red Badge of Courage , giving a narrative biography of the author. He also received the 1992 St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates. Foote was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1994. Also in 1994, Foote joined Protect Historic America and was instrumental in opposing a Disney theme park near battlefield sites in Virginia. Along the way, Burns asked him to return for his upcoming documentary Baseball , where he appeared in both the 2nd Inning discussing his recollections of the dynamics of the crowds in his youth and in the 5th Inning , where he gave an account of his meeting Babe Ruth . In 1998, the author Tony Horwitz visited Foote for his book Confederates in the Attic , a meeting in which Foote declared he was \"dismayed\" by the \"behavior of blacks, who are fulfilling every dire prophesy the Ku Klux Klan made,\" and that African Americans were \"acting as if the utter lie about blacks being somewhere between ape and man were true.\" Foote emphasized that his loyalties during the 1860s would have been to Southerners: \"I\u2019d be with my people, right or wrong.\" Foote also argued that freedmen had led to the failure of Reconstruction and that the Confederate flag represented \"law, honour, love of country.\" Foote stated that he would have been willing to fight for the Confederacy: \"If I was against slavery, I'd still be with the South. I'm a man, my society needs me, here I am.\" In 1999, Foote received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement and an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from The College of William & Mary . On September 2, 2001, he was the focus of the C-SPAN television program In-Depth . In a three-hour interview, conducted by C-SPAN founder Brian Lamb , Foote shows off the library of his home, working room, and writing desk, and details the writing of his books as well as taking on-air calls and emails. Foote campaigned in the 2001 referendum on the Flag of Mississippi , arguing against a proposal which would have replaced the Confederate battle flag with a blue canton with 20 stars. Foote rejected the Confederate flag's association with white supremacy and argued \"I\u2019m for the Confederate flag always and forever. Many among the finest people this country has ever produced died in that war. To take it and call it a symbol of evil is a misrepresentation.\" In 2003, Foote received the Peggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author Award. The Helmerich Award is presented annually by the Tulsa Library Trust . Foote died at Baptist Hospital in Memphis on June 27, 2005, aged 88. He suffered a heart attack following a pulmonary embolism. He was interred in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis. His grave is beside the family plot of General Forrest. Legacy In 2013, the Sons of Confederate Veterans protested the removal of Nathan Bedford Forrest 's statue in Memphis by invoking Foote's characterization of him as a \"humane slave holder.\" Shelby Foote historical marker, Greenville, Mississippi (2019) In 2017, the conservative writer Bill Kauffman , writing in The American Conservative , argued for a revival of Foote's sympathetic portrayal of the South. In October 2017, John F. Kelly , the White House Chief of Staff under President Donald Trump , argued that \"the lack of ability to compromise led to the Civil War\" and praised Robert E. Lee as an \"honorable man.\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended Kelly's controversial remarks by citing Foote's work. On October 18, 2019, a Mississippi Writers Trail historical marker was installed in Greenville, Mississippi, to honor Foote's literary and historical contributions.

Both were also presented as unabridged audio books read by the author. Other Foote edited a modern edition of Chickamauga And Other Civil War Stories (previously published as The Night Before Chancellorsville And Other Civil War Stories ), an anthology of Civil War stories by various authors. Foote contributed a lengthy introduction to the 1993 Modern Library edition of Stephen Crane 's The Red Badge of Courage (which was published along with \"The Veteran,\" a short story that features the hero of the larger work at the end of his life). In this introduction, Foote recounts the biography of Crane in the same narrative style as Foote's Civil War work. Foote collaborated with his wife's cousin, photographer Nell Dickerson, to produce the book Gone: A Photographic Plea for Preservation . Dickerson used Foote's story \"Pillar of Fire,\" from his 1954 novel Jordan County: A Landscape in Narrative , as the text to illustrate her photographs of southern antebellum buildings in ruins. In popular culture Foote's distinctive Southern accent was the model for Daniel Craig 's character in the 2019 film Knives Out .

{"id": "doc_random_058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember_(coach_operator)", "text": "Ember is a coach operator based in Edinburgh , Scotland. It operates the first electric intercity coach services in Scotland. History Founding and early development (2019\u20132020) Ember was founded in 2019 by Pierce Glennie and Keith Bradbury, both of whom had previously worked for iwoca . Glennie has stated that the concept for the company was inspired by a long-distance bus journey he undertook from Namibia to South Africa . The name Ember was chosen to reflect the idea of \u201cthe end of fire\u201d. Ember\u2019s first planned route, numbered the E1 , was to operate between Dundee and Edinburgh . Originally scheduled to commence in March 2020, the launch was delayed due to government restrictions introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic , which also postponed the delivery of the company\u2019s first electric coach. To support the launch, Ember received a \u00a3490,000 Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan through Triodos Bank . The company ultimately began operations in October 2020 with two battery-electric coaches, which recharged using Dundee City Council charging infrastructure at Greenmarket. Expansion of routes and fleet (2021\u20132023) In February 2022, Ember was awarded \u00a35,562,126 from the Scottish Zero Emission Bus Challenge Fund (ScotZEB) to support the purchase of twenty-six battery-electric vehicles and the associated charging infrastructure. The company stated its intention to develop a national zero-emission coach network connecting Scotland\u2019s major cities. In August 2022, Ember launched a new route between Dundee and Glasgow , designated the E3. In July 2023, Ember placed an order for fourteen tri-axle Yutong GTe14 battery-electric coaches. This order increased Ember\u2019s total fleet of Yutong electric coaches to thirty-eight vehicles. Co-founder Pierce Glennie highlighted the reliability of the company\u2019s existing Yutong TCe12 coaches as a key factor in enabling the rapid expansion of its zero-emission route network within three years of launch. As of July 2024, three of the GTe14 coaches had entered service, with the remainder undergoing fit-out and branding. Network diversification and service enhancements (2024) In January 2024, Ember introduced the E10 service, described by the company as a \u201cshort but useful\u201d route, operating between Dundee Michelin Scotland Innovation Parc and Dundee city centre. The service operates more than forty times per day in each direction, calling at three pre-booked stops. The route was designed to make productive use of depot movements that would otherwise constitute dead mileage, while also providing connections with Ember\u2019s Edinburgh and Glasgow services, with future through-ticketing planned. In March 2024, Ember raised \u00a311 million in equity funding from climate-focused investors, including Pale Blue Dot and Contrarian Ventures. The funding was intended to support the expansion of the intercity network, charging infrastructure, and the company\u2019s in-house technology platform. In May 2024, Ember launched the E3X express service between Perth city centre and Glasgow , operating four services per day in each direction, with two services extending to Dundee . The service commenced on 7 May. During the same month, Ember introduced the E1X service operating between Dundee , Kinross , Edinburgh and Wallyford Park and Ride, where vehicles utilised newly installed charging facilities, before returning to Dundee. The E1X service was withdrawn on 22 October 2024. In September 2024, Ember announced plans to launch a new route linking Bridge of Don and Aberdeen city centre with Edinburgh via Dundee , with intermediate stops including Brechin and Forfar . The route also provides a connection to Edinburgh Airport . Full service commencement was scheduled for 22 October 2024, with twenty services per day operating throughout the week. The introduction of this route doubled the frequency between Dundee and Edinburgh to forty services per day, providing a half-hourly service for much of the day. To support operations, Ember established a new depot in Bridge of Don, complementing its existing depot in Dundee. Further network growth (2025) In April 2025, Ember announced the introduction of a new route between Fort William and Edinburgh . A further announcement in May 2025 confirmed the launch of a Fort William to Glasgow service. In June 2025, the E7 route between Aberdeen and Inverness commenced operations. In July 2025, Ember announced that the E6 route, operating between Inverness and Thurso & Scrabster , would begin on 9 July. Later that month, on 23 July, the company launched the E11 route between Dundee and Aberdeen via Braemar . In September 2025, Ember introduced the E4X express service between Edinburgh and Fort William . On 22 October 2025, Ember commenced operation of the E8 route between Glasgow and Inverness . This was followed by the launch of the E9 route between Edinburgh and Inverness on 5 November 2025. Coach hire and fleet expansion In September 2025, Ember expanded beyond scheduled intercity services with the launch of Ember Coach Hire, a zero-emission private hire service utilising its electric coach fleet. The service operates alongside Ember\u2019s scheduled routes and is supported by the company\u2019s proprietary technology platform, Ember OS, which manages vehicle allocation and live tracking. By late 2025, Ember operated a fully electric fleet of seventy-eight vehicles. A further tranche of coaches funded through the second round of the Scottish Zero Emission Bus Challenge Fund (ScotZEB2) is expected to increase the fleet to approximately 138 vehicles in Scotland by the end of the first quarter of 2026. In November 2025, Ember announced the launch of a dedicated electric coach hire service for group travel and stated its intention to expand its fleet further, with plans to add up to 100 additional electric coaches by 2026. Charging infrastructure Ember\u2019s charging infrastructure has expanded alongside its fleet growth. In addition to its original hub in Dundee , the company operates charging facilities in Fort William , Thurso and Inverness , with further sites under development in Oban , Perth , Livingston and Glasgow . The network supports both scheduled services and private hire operations. Routes E1 Bridge of Don \u2013 Edinburgh Half of the services will terminate in Dundee, the others will continue to Bridge of Don. Stops at Longforgan , Horn Milk Bar, St Madoes and Walnut Grove will only be operated by the short service which terminates in Dundee.

Most intermediate must be booked ten minutes before schedule to ensure that the bus will stop. Often these are stops in remote areas with poor WiFi and mobile phone connectivity. Passengers with a Scottish National Entitlement Card travel for free. Through tickets are available to Edinburgh Airport , which includes a short tram journey from Ingliston . At night, the buses go straight to Edinburgh Airport. In May 2024, Ember increased fares by an average of around 4%, followed by a further increase of approximately 8.5% in April 2025 and 6.1% in February 2026, citing rising operating costs and changes to concessionary reimbursement levels. The company maintains fixed pricing regardless of booking time and does not use dynamic yield-based fare systems. Services Tickets can be purchased online up to ten minutes before departure and, at most stops, onboard using contactless payment. Cash is not accepted. Many intermediate stops operate on a demand-responsive basis and must be booked in advance for the coach to call. Passengers holding a Scottish National Entitlement Card are entitled to free travel, including companion travel where applicable. Through tickets to Edinburgh Airport are available, with daytime services connecting via Edinburgh Trams at Ingliston Park & Ride and overnight services calling directly at the airport terminal. Ember coaches are equipped with passenger facilities including toilets on the majority of vehicles, free Wi-Fi, USB charging points at each seat, and accessible spaces for wheelchairs and bicycles, which can be reserved in advance. In addition to scheduled intercity services, Ember offers private coach hire using its all-electric fleet for schools, corporate travel, events and tourism within Scotland . Ember coaches are fitted with passenger amenities including free Wi-Fi, USB charging points at each seat, and accessible spaces for wheelchairs and bicycles, which can be reserved in advance. Services are tracked in real time via Ember\u2019s website, allowing passengers to monitor vehicle location and expected arrival times. Tickets can be amended or cancelled without charge prior to departure. Fleet Ember's first two Yutong TCe12 battery electric coaches were delivered in 2020. A further two were added in 2021, and four more in 2022, funded by the Scottish Utra-Low Emission Bus Scheme. Ember has taken delivery of fourteen Yutong GTe14 tri-axle electric coaches in early 2024 \u2013 the first operator to order the coach model. Ember was also awarded government funding in March 2021 for four single-deck Arrival buses , the development of which was ultimately postponed in 2022. The company also had eight new additions to the fleet of Yutong TCe12s in 2023. In 2023, Ember became the first bus operator in the United Kingdom to develop its own ITSO-certified smart ticketing system in-house. The system enables validation of Scottish National Entitlement Cards and integration with concessionary travel schemes, replacing third-party solutions that could not be integrated with Ember\u2019s platform. As of 2025, Ember operates its electric coach fleet exclusively on Michelin tyres, supplied directly by the manufacturer and fitted in-house. The arrangement applies to both Yutong TCe12 and GTe14 battery-electric coaches. References ^ \"EMBER CORE LTD overview\" . Companies House .

It consists of 37 stations from Howrah Junction to Midnapore . The entire line is at grade level. It has section of triple track starting from Howrah Junction and ends at Midnapore , Amta , Haldia and Digha stations in West Bengal. Amta line bound train is crossing Howrah south line near Mourigram. The South Eastern line in Kolkata consists of 3 major corridors, which bifurcate as they run into the suburban satellite towns. Two corridors (one local and other through) follow the South Eastern Railway run from Howrah Junction (HWH) to Midnapore (128\u00a0km). At the mainline there is a bifurcation into two branch lines \u2013 one from Panskura to Haldia (69\u00a0km) in the south-east and the other from Shalimar to Amta (50\u00a0km) in the west. These two corridors constitute the 'main' South Eastern line. The major car sheds on this line are at Tikiapara , Panskura & Kharagpur . There are fast and slow locals here for suburban service. Trains usually start from and terminate at important stations. Stations with Routes Routes The South Eastern line consists of the following routes: Howrah Jn \u2013 Midnapore Panskura Jn \u2013 Haldia Shalimar \u2013 Amta Tamluk Jn \u2013 Digha Andul - Dankuni Stations Names in bold indicate that the station is a fast train stop as well as important terminal.

{"id": "doc_random_062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_brain", "text": "Maternal affection, by Edward Hodges Baily Parental experience, as well as changing hormone levels during pregnancy and postpartum, cause changes in the parental brain . Displaying maternal sensitivity towards infant cues, processing those cues and being motivated to engage socially with her infant and attend to the infant's needs in any context could be described as mothering behavior and is regulated by many systems in the maternal brain. Research has shown that hormones such as oxytocin , prolactin , estradiol and progesterone are essential for the onset and the maintenance of maternal behavior in rats, and other mammals as well. Mothering behavior has also been classified within the basic drives (sexual desire, hunger and thirst, fear, power/dominance etc.). Less is known about the paternal brain , but changes in the father's brain occur alongside the mother. Research on this topic is continuing to expand as more researchers examine fathers. Many of the brain regions and networks responsible for parental behavior are responsible for parental behavior in human fathers after having a child. Changes in hormones, brain activation and brain structure (mainly changes in gray matter) are seen in both human mothers and fathers, with hormonal changes beginning in both males and females before the birth of their children, with changes continuing to develop after the birth of children. Maternal brain Maternal hormonal effect Different hormone levels in the maternal brain and the overall well being of the mother account for 40%\u201350% of differences in the mother's attachment to her infant. Mothers experience a decrease in estrogen and an increase in oxytocin and prolactin caused by lactation , pregnancy , parturition and interaction with the infant. Oxytocin The levels of oxytocin in the maternal brain correlate with maternal behaviors such as gazing, vocalization, positive affect, affectionate touch and other similar mother-infant relationship behaviors. Estradiol and progesterone High mother-infant attachment correlates with a higher ratio of estradiol / progesterone at the end of pregnancy , than at the beginning. Cortisol In the first few days after giving birth the levels of cortisol are high which correlates with maternal approach behavior and positive maternal attitudes. Mothers with high levels of cortisol were also found to be more vocal towards their children. Mothers who experienced adversity in their own childhood, had higher daily patterns of cortisol levels, and were less maternally sensitive . Glucocorticoids Glucocorticoids are not essential for displaying maternal behaviors, but in mothers, the levels of glucocorticoids are elevated as to initiate lactation. Neuroanatomy Different areas/structures of the brain are associated with different factors which contribute to maternal behavior. One's own infant acts as a special stimulus which triggers activation of different areas of the brain. These brain areas together allow for maternal behavior and related systems. The Medial Preoptic Area (MPOA) of the hypothalamus contains receptors for estradiol , progesterone , prolactin , oxytocin , vasopressin and opioids . All these hormones are involved in some way in activating maternal behavior in the brain. The following are other behavioral changes necessary for mothering that the MPOA is responsible for: mother's affect (changes made by the amygdala , prefrontal cortex ) stimulus salience (changes made by the amygdala and nucleus accumbens ) attention (changes made by the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex ) memory (changes made by the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex ). Skin-to-skin contact with a newborn helps to increase the mother's oxytocin The amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex also contain receptors for the hormones which are most likely to be changing behavior at the time of pregnancy, and may be the sites where these changes occur. Increased activity has also been observed in the amygdala as the mother is responding to emotions seen in negative (fearful) faces, positive faces or familiar faces that her baby makes. Primate mothers with damage to the prefrontal cortex have also been associated with disrupted maternal behavior. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays a role in the attention, cognitive flexibility and working memory of the mother. It helps the mother identify infant cues. In any environment and efficiently, it allows for the decision-making and action planning process involved in attending to the infant's cues. The thalamus , parietal cortex , and brain stem serve for processing the smell, touch and vocalization associated with the infant. Postpartum changes Changes in estrogen , oxytocin and prolactin in the early postpartum period cause changes in the structures of the maternal brain. In animal mothers Postpartum, new neuron production is suppressed due to decreased levels of estrogen and increased levels of glucocorticoids in mother rats. Mother-infant interaction is also thought to suppress neurogenesis in the hippocampus postpartum in the rat maternal brain. Maternal experience increases neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SBZ) which is responsible for producing the neurons of the olfactory bulb . Prolactin is the hormone which mediates the increase in neurogenesis in SBZ. In animals, structures of the mother's brain change postpartum due to the increased interaction of the mother with the infant. The volume of gray matter increases postpartum in the following brain regions: bilateral hypothalamus amygdala substantia nigra globus pallidus . These changes in the brain may occur in order to promote appropriate mothering behavior. The mother's positive attitude towards the infant can be used as a predictor for the increase in gray matter in the above stated brain structures. Also in rats, the increased interaction with pups causes an increase in density in the MPOA . Postpartum increase in gray matter volumes may help the mother activate the motivation to perform maternal behavior in response to cue from their offspring. Postpartum, the substantia nigra activates positive responses to the pup stimuli via dopamine neurons. In human mothers The amygdala , prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus begin to change during pregnancy due to the high levels of stress experienced by the mother during this time. In human mothers there was a correlation between increased gray matter volume in the substantia nigra and positive emotional feelings towards the infant. Other changes such as menstrual cycle , hydration , weight and nutrition may also be factors which trigger the maternal brain to change during pregnancy and postpartum . Maternal experience alters behaviors which stem from the hippocampus such as enhancing spatial navigation learning and behaviors linked with anxiety . Recent research has begun to look at how maternal psychopathology affects the maternal brain in relation to parenting. Daniel Schechter and colleagues have studied specifically interpersonal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid dissociation as associated with specific patterns of maternal neural activation in response to viewing silent video-stimuli of stressful parent-toddler interactions such as separation versus less-stressful ones such as play. Importantly, less medial prefrontal cortex activity and greater limbic system activity (i.e. entorhinal cortex and hippocampus ) were found among these post-traumatically stressed mothers of toddlers compared to mothers of toddlers without PTSD in response to stressful parent-child interactions as well as, within a different sample, in response to menacing adult male-female interactions. In the latter study, this pattern of corticolimbic dysregulation was linked to less observed maternal sensitivity during mother-child play. Decreased ventral-medial prefrontal cortex activity in violence-exposed mothers, in response to viewing their own and unfamiliar toddlers in video-clips of separation versus play, has also been associated with increased PTSD symptoms, parenting stress and decreased methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene. Early experiences and shaping Women who had a positive experience involving their family in their childhood are more likely to be more maternally sensitive and provide that same experience for their own children. Mothers that had negative experiences involving their families undergo neurobiological changes which lead to high stress reactivity and insecure attachment . This causes lower maternal responsiveness to their infant's needs. Rat mothers provide high levels of maternal care (licking and grooming) to their offspring if they themselves received high maternal care as a pup from their own mothers. Rat mothers who received low levels of maternal care as pups have lower levels of expression of the glucocorticoid receptor gene and lower synaptic density in the hippocampus . In human mothers, lower hippocampal volume has been associated with a lower ability to regulate emotions and stress, which can be linked with decreased maternal sensitivity as a mother. Mothers with insecure attachments to their own mothers display higher amygdala sensitivity to negative emotional stimuli, like hearing their infant cry. Having more difficulty dealing with stress makes mothers less responsive to their infant's cues. Larger gray matter and increased activations of the following brain areas occur in mothers who had experienced higher quality maternal care as infants: middle temporal gyrus superior temporal sulcus and middle frontal cortex . This allows the mother to be more sensitive to her own infant's needs. Postpartum depression has also been associated with mothers who received low quality maternal care early in their own life. Paternal brain In only 6% of mammalian species, including humans, the father plays a significant role in caring for his young. Similar to the changes that occur in the maternal brain, the same areas of the brain ( amygdala , hypothalamus , prefrontal cortex , olfactory bulb etc.) are activated in the father, and hormonal changes occur in the paternal brain to ensure display of parenting behavior. Paternal hormonal effect An increase in levels of oxytocin , glucocorticoids , estrogen and prolactin occur in the paternal brain. These hormonal changes occur through the father's interaction with the mother and his offspring. Oxytocin levels are positively correlated with the amount of affection the father displays towards the child. In humans, and in other primate species, lower levels of testosterone have been linked to the display of paternal behavior. In animal fathers In father rats, just as in the mother rats, a decrease in neurogenesis in the hippocampus occurs postpartum . Just like in mothers, fathers also have increased levels of glucocorticoids which are thought to suppress the production of new cells in the brain. Marmoset fathers have enhanced dendritic spine density in the prefrontal cortex . This increase correlates with increase in vasopressin receptors in this area of the paternal brain. With age, this effect is reversed, and is therefore believed to be driven by father-infant interactions. Changes in neurogenesis in the prefrontal cortex of the paternal brain have been linked in some species to recognition of kin. In human fathers Being exposed to crying babies activates the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala in both fathers and mothers, but not in non-parents. The level of testosterone in the paternal brain correlates with the effectiveness of the father's response to the baby's cry. Increased levels of prolactin in the paternal brain has also been correlated with a more positive response to the infant's cry. Similar to mothers, fathers have a reduction of gray matter in the orbitofrontal cortex areas, and increase of gray matter in the hypothalamus and amygdala after having a child.

{"id": "doc_random_063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadan_(subcaste)", "text": "Nadans (also referred as Nelamaikkarar ) are a small endogamous group of aristocratic Nadars from the regions south of the Thamirabarani River in the present-day state of Tamil Nadu , India. They were hereditary tax collectors during the Nayak and Pandyan rule and also served as petty lords under the poligars . The Nadans possessed vast tracts of land and were one of the few sub-castes among the Nadars to have practiced aristocracy . The term Nadan means lords of the land . History As hereditary tax collectors, the Nadans held civil authority over the lands in their control. The term Nadan means lords of the land . The Nadar climbers were totally dependent on these powerful landlords and treated them with great respect. In the regions dominated by the Nadans, even the Vellalar accountant or the Brahmin priest would show deference to the position of the Nadan lords. They rode horses and would buy slaves to work in their houses to retain their proud customs. The Nadan women followed strict gosha, revealing themselves only to the men of their own household, and rode in covered palanquins . The Nadans built Hindu temples and also bore festival expenses. The oldest and highest Nadans were the Adityans of Kayamozhi, who claimed they were the descendants of Surya , the sun god. The Adityans also had special rights at the Shiva temple in Thiruchendur , where they constructed one of its pavilions. They usually donated the huge wooden car to the temple and in return were given the privilege to be the first to touch the rope which would pull the car through the streets during festival times. Despite their great wealth and power the Nadans, however, were considered as a portion of the greater class of Nadars and were denied entrance into temples built by higher castes. The Nadans shared the pollution of the lowest climbers. The Nadans would not enter Hindu temples built by higher castes until the issue was solved through campaigning movements and legislation. They claim that they were stripped of their rights and privileges due to the Nayak invasion. The Nadar community was then divided into different opposing groups, with each Nadar climber owing allegiance to a Nadan family. The control of the lands may pass from one Nadan to another but the climbers remained always with the trees assigned to them. Opposing Christianity In 1680, the first congregation of Nadars was started at Vadakkankulam with the conversion of a Nadar woman. The Nadar converts came neither from the lowest sections ( Kalla Shanar ) of the castes nor from the highest ( Nadans ), but from the middle subgroups and particularly the climbers. The converts were provided protection by the missionaries from the oppressions of Nadan landlords. With their traditional dominance threatened, the Nadans became the missionaries' greatest adversaries. Many Nadans supported anti-Christian societies such as the Vibuthi Sangam(the Sacred Ashes Society). However, by the 1860s the opposition of the Nadans began to wane. Eventually a few Nadans actually converted to Christianity . Nadars of Travancore The Nadar climbers of Southern Travancore served as palmyra climbers on the lands of aristocratic Nadans in the eastern portion of Kanniyakumari . In the tradition of these Nadan families, the lands were bestowed by the kings of Travancore in return for the Nadans' services. Distinctions within the Nadar community today During the 1960s, the Nadan families had some aura of aristocracy and authority. The distinctions that separated them from the rest of the Nadar community were largely gone, as the Nadar climbers gained wealth. The once Nadar climbers are today widely into education, business and other important fields. References ^ Robert Hardgrave. The Nadars of Tamil Nadu .

Description The length of the shell varies between 24 mm and 80 mm. The shell is white or yellowish-brown, sometimes banded. The occasional varix is much thickened, being composed of a number of parallel, close laminae. The outer lip and the columella are tinged with yellow. The operculum is diamond-shaped, with two short sides above and two long ones below, the angles rounded. Distribution V. salebrosa is found on the tropical Pacific coast of America, from Baja California to Peru . It lives under rocks in the intertidal and subtidal zones. Feeding This species is an ectoparasite of other molluscs. Members of the species bore a hole through the host's shell and suck its blood or digestive organ (depending on the prey) over a period of months. Consistent with their suctorial feeding habit, they have a long proboscis, reduced buccal mass, and simplified digestive system compared to other Muricids. Prey include the oyster Ostrea cf. fisheri [4] , the limpet-like slipper shell Crucibulum spinosum , and the vermetid gastropod Tripsycha (Eualetes) tulipa .

The undivided province's representation encompassed what the present-day provinces of Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur , and the independent component city of Naga . History Ambos Camarines was initially represented in the lower house of the Philippine Legislature through three assembly districts. When seats for the upper house of the Philippine Legislature were elected from territory-based districts between 1916 and 1935, the province (and its successor provinces of Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur ) formed part of the sixth senatorial district which elected two out of the 24-member Senate . On March 3, 1919, the Philippine Legislature approved Act No. 2809 which divided Ambos Camarines into two provinces: per Section 3 of the said law the province's northern municipalities were constituted into Camarines Norte , while the remaining territory of Ambos Camarines was renamed Camarines Sur . Pursuant to Sections 4 and 5 of Act No. 2809 Camarines Norte was provided one lower house representative , and Camarines Sur two representatives ; both provinces elected their separate representatives starting in the November 1919 elections . 1st District (defunct) Municipalities : Capalonga , Daet , Gainza , Indan , Labo , Libmanan , Lupi , Mambulao , Milaor , Minalabac , Pamplona , Paracale , Pasacao , Ragay , San Fernando , San Vicente , Sipocot , Basud (re-established 1908) , Talisay (re-established 1908) , Cabusao (established 1914) 2nd District (defunct) Municipalities : Baao , Bato , Bula , Calabanga , Iriga , Magarao , Nabua , Nueva Caceres (Naga) , Pili , Camaligan (established 1909) , Canaman (established 1909) 3rd District (defunct) Municipalities : Buhi , Caramoan , Goa , Lagonoy , Sag\u00f1ay , San Jose , Siruma , Tigaon , Tinambac At-Large (defunct) See also Legislative district of Camarines Norte Legislative districts of Camarines Sur References ^ Philippine Legislature (1920).

{"id": "doc_random_070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-grunge", "text": "Post-grunge is an offshoot of grunge that has a less abrasive or intense tone than traditional grunge. Originally, the term was used derisively and indicated mid-1990s alternative rock bands such as Bush , Candlebox , Collective Soul , Live , Foo Fighters , and Silverchair , that emulated the original sound of grunge. In the late 1990s, post-grunge became a more clearly defined style that combined the sound and aesthetic of grunge with more commercially accessible songwriting, rising to prominence that lasted into the 2000s. Bands such as Foo Fighters, Creed , Matchbox Twenty , 3 Doors Down , Puddle of Mudd , Nickelback , Seether , and Staind achieved mainstream success in this second wave. Some bands in this wave also had crossover with the alternative metal and nu metal genres. Characteristics During the 1990s, a post-grunge sound emerged that emulated the attitudes and music of grunge, particularly its thick, distorted guitars , but with a less intense and less abrasive tone. Unlike many early grunge bands, post-grunge bands often worked through major record labels . Post-grunge music tends to be in mid-tempo and is noted for having \"a polished, radio-ready production\", oftentimes with pop song structures, and incorporated influences from other genres such as classic rock , pop rock , alternative metal , and nu metal . Tim Grierson of About.com wrote that musically, post-grunge bands \"split the difference between plaintive ballads and aggressive rockers, resulting in songs that combine the two extremes into a sad-eyed, propulsive middle ground\". On some occasions, post-grunge music features both an electric guitar and an acoustic guitar playing simultaneously. Post-grunge tends to have production quality that is more polished than grunge. Hence, Graham Hartmann of Metal Injection noted that the genre's second wave \"had a vice grip on rock radio from the mid-to-late 2000s\u2014arguably the last time a wave of rock experienced mainstream popularity.\" Post-grunge band Nickelback in 2008 A \"major rift\" between grunge and post-grunge is in the lyrical substance of the music; grunge often expressed emotion through loose metaphors or third-person narratives, while post-grunge was known for being direct and blunt. While describing lyrics that are common in post-grunge , Sasha Geffen of Consequence of Sound wrote that post-grunge \"plunged directly into the 'I.' \" Geffen also wrote that most post-grunge songs that achieved mainstream success \"call after a prospective or past companion in the first person\". Post-grunge lyrics also tend to be about topics such as relationships, romance and drug addiction. According to Geffen, \"grunge's frontmen posed with their addictions; post-grunge's songwriters sought redemption for them\". Geffen then states that post-grunge songs \"fit the mold of songs made for \u00a0 ... teenage boys and girls\" who were \"longing for a distant someone\". Etymology British band Bush ( pictured ) were described by Matt Diehl of Rolling Stone as \"the most successful and shameless mimics of Nirvana's music\". Originally, post-grunge was a label that was meant to be almost pejorative, suggesting that mid-1990s bands labelled as post-grunge were simply musically derivative, or a cynical response to the \" authentic \" rock movement of grunge. When grunge became a mainstream genre through bands such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam , record labels started signing bands with similar sonic identities, such as Bush , Candlebox and Collective Soul . In the late 1990s and early 2000s, post-grunge morphed via newer bands like Creed and Nickelback , becoming a more well-defined style that combined characteristics of grunge with a more commercially accessible sound. Grierson wrote that \"bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam were beloved partly because of their perceived integrity in avoiding the mainstream,\" whereas \"Post-grunge, by comparison, seemed to exist in order to court that very audience.\" \"Butt rock\" In the 2010s, the derogatory term \"butt rock\", which was previously used to refer to 1980s glam metal and hard rock such as M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce , Def Leppard , and Poison , gained traction when applied to many second-wave post-grunge artists. Notably, the term would be used to refer to the likes of Nickelback , Creed , Puddle of Mudd , Shinedown , Flyleaf and Hinder . Graham Hartmann of Metal Injection stated that the term \"usually refers to the second wave of post-grunge music, where bands like Bush and Candlebox ultimately turned into Nickelback and Seether .\" Angelica Leicht of Houston Press said: \"Butt-rock is that musical stank on your shoe that you can\u2019t get off. It\u2019s one part aggro noise, one part self-indulgent and whiny singer, and somehow a whole lot of douche.\" The origins of the term are debated, with some attributing it to the alleged radio slogan \"Nothing but rock\". The term \"butt rock\" is usually used by individuals critical of what they perceive to be derivative musicianship, overly clich\u00e9d or angsty lyrics, and over-reliance on raspy vocals (often described as imitations of Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder ). Eva Zhu of CBC said butt rock is \"a style of music that manages to be as popular as it is hated.\" According to Erica Banas of WMMR , some consider butt rock to be rock music that is \"watered down both musically and lyrically\" in order to maximize radio airplay and mainstream success. She added: \"Perhaps, Butt Rock is truly in the ear of the beholder. It might just be a derogatory term rock fans use on bands they don't like.\" Butt rock has also been referred to as a subgenre in itself, or a microgenre. A related term for second-wave post-grunge is \"divorced dad rock\". History 1993\u20131997: First wave and rise in popularity Even at the height of their popularity, after the release of Nevermind (1991) brought grunge to international attention, Nirvana experienced increasing problems, partly caused by Kurt Cobain 's drug addiction and growing dissatisfaction with commercial success. In late 1992, Cobain was photographed in a T-shirt with 'Grunge is Dead' printed on its front at which point the genre's decline started to be widely discussed. Cobain's suicide in 1994, as well as Pearl Jam's touring problems, marked a decline for grunge that year. Problems of addiction for Layne Staley of Alice in Chains led to the band cancelling scheduled dates in 1995. Addiction and legal problems for Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots led to the band having touring problems, causing the band to tour their album Purple for only four months, and their follow up album Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop for only 6 weeks. Live, one of the first post-grunge bands, performing in 2013 As the original grunge movement began to fade, major record labels began signing and promoting bands emulating the genre in a more mainstream style, dubbed by some writers as \"post-grunge\". Though bands such as Bush and Candlebox have been categorized as grunge, both bands have also been categorized as post-grunge. Collective Soul and Live are two other bands categorized as post-grunge that emerged along with Bush and Candlebox. Bush, Candlebox, Collective Soul and Live all achieved mainstream success; Candlebox's self-titled album (1993) was certified 4\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and, according to Nielsen SoundScan , sold at least 4,000,000 copies. Its song \"Far Behind\" peaked at number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 . Collective Soul's song \"Shine\" peaked at number 11 on the same chart and was certified gold by the RIAA in September 1994. The band's album Hints Allegations and Things Left Unsaid (1993) was certified 2\u00d7 platinum by the RIAA, and their self-titled 1995 album was certified 3\u00d7 platinum by the RIAA. Bush's debut studio album Sixteen Stone (1994) was certified 6\u00d7 platinum by the RIAA and the band's second studio album Razorblade Suitcase (1996), which peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200 , was certified 3\u00d7 platinum by the RIAA. Carl Williott of Stereogum called Bush's album Sixteen Stone \"a harbinger of post-grunge's pop dominance\". Live's album Throwing Copper (1994) was certified 8\u00d7 platinum by the RIAA, and the band's album Secret Samadhi (1997) was certified 2\u00d7 platinum by the RIAA. Both Throwing Copper and Secret Samadhi peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200. Consequence of Sound ' s Paolo Ragusa credits Throwing Copper with starting post-grunge and shifting rock music to a new direction after the death of Kurt Cobain by combining some harder rock influences with clearer vocals, softer guitar melodies, and the production of Jerry Harrison to make a distinct sound. In 1995, former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl 's newer band Foo Fighters released their self-titled debut album , becoming one of the most commercially successful rock bands in the United States, aided by considerable airplay on MTV . Like grunge bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden , and Alice in Chains, the post-grunge band Candlebox was from Seattle , but post-grunge was marked by a broadening of its geographical base, with bands such as York, Pennsylvania 's Live, Atlanta, Georgia 's Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair , and England's Bush. 1997\u20132010: Second wave and peak popularity Post-grunge band Creed in 2002 The 1997 breakup of Soundgarden was seen by some as the end of the original grunge movement. Post-grunge then morphed in the late 1990s and 2000s, gaining further popularity with newer acts such as Creed , Matchbox Twenty , Days of the New , Fuel , Oleander , Godsmack , 3 Doors Down , Puddle of Mudd , Staind , Nickelback , Seether , Three Days Grace , Switchfoot , 12 Stones , Breaking Benjamin , Shinedown , Stone Sour , Hinder , Daughtry , and Skillet . This wave retained some of the angst and anger of the earlier artists but also had more conventional anthems, narratives, and romantic songs. Creed's albums My Own Prison (1997) and Weathered (2001) were both certified 6\u00d7 platinum by the RIAA. Weathered sold at least 6,400,000 copies in the United States. Creed's album Human Clay , released in 1999, was certified diamond by the RIAA and sold at least 11,690,000 copies in the United States.

The Foo Fighters' second album The Colour and the Shape , which is considered a post-grunge album, became a hit and was certified Platinum by the RIAA having sold at least two million copies in the United States. Nickelback broke into the mainstream in the early 2000s; their song \" How You Remind Me \" peaked at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. The Nickelback album that featured the song, Silver Side Up , was certified 6\u00d7 platinum by the RIAA and sold at least 5,528,000 copies in the United States.

The album's song \" Someday \" peaked at number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 1 on both the Canadian Singles Chart and the Adult Top 40 chart.

{"id": "doc_random_071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Turkmenistan", "text": "Women comprise 50.8% of Turkmenistan 's population. They generally have assigned roles in society and reduced rights compared to men. Study of women's rights in the country is made difficult by government censorship and lack of reliable, official data. Under Article 18 of the Constitution of Turkmenistan , women are guaranteed equal rights to men. In practice, however, they face routine political and societal discrimination. Women are not allowed to form independent women's organizations, and all such organizations must be registered under the Women's Union of Turkmenistan. They make up 16.8% of the country's Parliament. Most women work in the home, as mothers or homemakers, or in the markets as sellers. Though the country's Islamic roots are several centuries old, Turkmen women never were and are not required to wear a face covering . Background Women in Turkmenistan Location of Turkmenistan Turkmenistan is a country in Central Asia . Throughout the centuries, the territory of present-day Turkmenistan has been subjected to numerous civilizations, such as Persian empires, the conquest of Alexander the Great, Muslims , Mongols , Turkic peoples , and Russians . Throughout most of the 20th century it was part of the Soviet Union, until its fall in 1991. As with other former Soviet states, in the 1990s the economy collapsed and the country experienced social problems. Today, Turkmenistan is about half urban and half rural; its population is largely Muslim (89%), but there is also a significant Eastern Orthodox minority. The total fertility rate is 2.09 children born/woman (2015 est.). During the Soviet period, women assumed responsibility for the observance of some Muslim rites to protect their husbands' careers. Many women entered the work force out of economic necessity, a factor that disrupted some traditional family practices and increased the incidence of divorce . At the same time, educated urban women entered professional services and careers. After the collapse of the Soviet Union , however, traditional values began to reassert themselves. This had led to increasing numbers of women confined to the home and dependent on their male counterparts. Cultural role Cooking is the main field of work for women. Neighbours or relatives sometimes arrive unasked to assist in housework, or they may bring their own household tasks to work on together and socialize. Food preparation is done in the open air as well as in in-house kitchens. Tasks such as smoking meat and popping corn, are done by men and often turn into a social opportunity. Men and women might sit and eat in one place, but they are segregated during social occasions. Some women carry on the practice of wearing a ya\u015fmak , head scarf, in the initial year after they are wed. The wife clenches the corner of her scarf in her teeth to show a significant barrier toward the male guests and to show respect to her parents-in-law. The scarf also stops her from communicating. The wife may stop covering her head with a ya\u015fmak after a year of her wedding, after the birth of her first born, or by a decision within the family. Practices Clothing Women are garbed in ankle-length garments of silk or velvet, which are commonly a mix of bright oranges, purples, yellows, blues, and greens. The necklines are embellished with elaborate gold-thread needlework that drops down, decorating the neckline right to the navel. Richly decorated headwear, jewelry and embroidery accents are a part of their routine. Face covering is not required by law. Work Manufacturing of ketene , a homespun silk, persists largely as a cottage skill. Garments prepared from ketene are worn by both men and women. Costumes made from ketene are used as a customary bridal dress. The embroidery on the garments reveal various patterns that are exclusively known as a family hallmark, distinguishing the family of its maker. Skilled Turkmen women use antique weaving looms known as tara, which were adopted in the ancient times. Turkmen teachers and healthcare workers are primarily women. Job cuts in both these sectors, however, have led to a dramatic rise in unemployment for both men and women. Marriage Article 25 of the Constitution of Turkmenistan requires mutual consent for marriage. Both individuals must also be above the age of 18. Turkmen marriages feature numerous unique customs and rituals. Turkmen wedding dresses are often richly decorated and covered in silver-colored pendants which are believed to drive away evil spirits. Political influence Women comprise 16.8% of the Turkmen Parliament, and domestic law guarantees women the right to political participation. However, the actual participation of women in government is stifled by the curtailing of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).

{"id": "doc_random_072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macarena_Vald%C3%A9s", "text": "In this Chilean name , the first or paternal surname is Vald\u00e9s and the second or maternal family name is Mu\u00f1oz . Yudy Macarena Vald\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz (23 December 1983\u201322 August 2016) was a Mapuche human rights activist who led a campaign against the construction of a hydroelectric plant on the Tranguil River. Following her death, she has been compared to other murdered South American female activists including Berta C\u00e1ceres and Marielle Franco . Biography Vald\u00e9s was born in Huala\u00f1\u00e9 , Maule Region , but spent most of her life in Santiago . In 2014, after wishing to live according to Mapuche culture and principles, Vald\u00e9s, alongside her partner, Rub\u00e9n Coll\u00edo, and their children moved to Tranguil, Los R\u00edos Region , where they joined the Mapuche community of Newen. Coll\u00edo was subsequently elected as the community's werk\u00e9n , increasing Vald\u00e9s' visibility and profile in the local community. A hydroelectric plant was under construction on the Tranguil River by the Austrian company RP Global and the Chilean company SAESA, which had resulted in the felling of native forests and the flooding of two eltuwe (ancestral cemeteries). Coll\u00edo led the Mapuche campaign to halt the plant's construction, with him and Vald\u00e9s leading a series of demonstrations, including one on 1 August 2016 which saw Vald\u00e9s and other members of the community block route CH 201, a national highway leading to a border crossing with Argentina . The demonstrations resulted in the Provincial Government of Valdivia initiating a dialogue between RP Global, SAESA, and local communities about the plans for the plant. Death and investigation Vald\u00e9s was last seen alive at around 13:00 on 22 August 2016 by Coll\u00edo. She was due to attend a routine medical appointment with her infant son in the town of Liqui\u00f1e and had planned to catch a bus at 14:30. Vald\u00e9s' 11-year-old son returned home and found Vald\u00e9s hanging from a rope tied to a beam, with her youngest son still present. Coll\u00edo filed a criminal complaint following Vald\u00e9s' death. The investigation was led by public prosecutor Alejandra Anabal\u00f3n from the Panguipulli Local Prosecutor's Office. The first autopsy, performed by the Legal Medical Service of Valdivia, classified Vald\u00e9s' cause of death as \"asphysxiation by hanging\" and noted that her body showed no injuries attributable to third parties. The prosecutor's office interviewed Vald\u00e9s' relatives about her psychological state and concluded that she had suffered from depression and so closed the investigation with the verdict that she had likely died by suicide . Vald\u00e9s' family and the Newen community in Tranguil questioned the verdict of suicide in light of previous death threats Vald\u00e9s had received for taking part in demonstrations against the construction of the hydroelectric plant. In 2018, a forensic doctor hired by Vald\u00e9s' family completed an analysis of Vald\u00e9s' autopsy report and questioned the results, concluding that she was likely already dead at the point at which she was hanged due to her neck not showing any injuries ordinarily caused from hanging whilst alive; a second autopsy was recommended. On 21 August 2017, the prosecutor's office officially reopened the investigation, and a second autopsy was completed, concluding that \"the existence of objective signs that support that the victim had been alive at the time of being suspended by a rope or noose... is not confirmed\". A histopathological study of tissue from Vald\u00e9s' neck by scientists at the University of Chile established the absence of vital lesions, meaning that she was likely dead at the point of being hung from the beam. At the end of 2018, the official investigation into Vald\u00e9s' death was reclassified from \"suicide\" to \"discovery of a corpse\". Following the second autopsy, pathologist John Clark issued a report, published on 12 August 2019, highlighting the lack of detailed description of how she was found deceased in the official investigation report, in addition to \"deficient\" initial forensic examinations of Vald\u00e9s' body. Clark concluded that Vald\u00e9s had died from ligature strangulation and that her body may have been suspended later to simulate suicide. Response Following Vald\u00e9s' death, activist groups denounced that she had been murdered in a form of corporate femicide due to her being a Mapuche woman defending indigenous land from being plundered from companies. The social media campaigns #FueHomicidio and #ALaNegraLaMatron\" demanded justice for Vald\u00e9s and were used as slogans at demonstrations held in Chile demanding justice for Vald\u00e9s.

Robinson in 1917 William Edward Robinson (1863 \u2013 10 May 1927) was an English merchant and Liberal Party politician. Family and career Robinson was born in Burslem , Staffordshire the son of William Robinson of Stoke on Trent . He married in 1892. By profession he was a potter's merchant and in religion he was a member of the United Methodist Church . His grandson was Neville Robinson physicist. Local politics He was an elected member of Stoke on Trent council, becoming an Alderman and was later Mayor of the town circa 1918 for three years in succession. He had a particular interest in housing and transport issues. Parliament He stood for Parliament only once being elected Liberal MP for Stoke-on-Trent, Burslem at the 1923 general election . In a straight fight (apparently with Unionist support) he defeated the sitting Labour MP, Andrew MacLaren by the narrow margin of 63 votes, just 0.2% of the total poll. Robinson, perhaps mindful of his local arrangement with the Conservatives, voted against his own party in the division which brought in the first Labour government . Robinson was also one of a minority of Liberal MPs who voted with the Tories to force a debate on unemployment in May 1924 and again on an employment issue in August. He decided not to defend his Burslem seat in 1924 when Labour was opposed by a Constitutionalist candidate, the former Liberal William Allen . Allen later won election in Burslem at the 1931 general election . Constitutionalist was a label used by some anti- socialist candidates in UK general elections in the early 1920s. Most of the candidates were former Liberal Party members, and many of them joined the Conservative Party soon after being elected. The best known Constitutionalist candidate was Winston Churchill . Robinson did not try to re-enter the House of Commons . Death Robinson died on 10 May 1927 aged 63 years.

Biographical information Meletopoulos was born in Vostitsa ( Aigio ) and was one of the six children of Aggelis Meletopoulos and Anastasia Charalampi. His grandfather was Christodoulos Meletopoulos, a notable who actively participated in the Orlov Revolt of 1770. Before 1821, Dimitrios Meletopoulos worked as a raisin merchant. He became member of Filiki Eteria in 1819 through his father, who served in Constantinople as vekil and participated in the assembly of Vostitsa. Together with Andreas Londos and Leontas Messinezis, the younger Meletopoulos supported the proposal of Papaflessas for the immediate start of the Revolution. During the Revolution he initially supported the Londos family. On 26 March 1821 he seized Vostitsa from the Ottomans . He also participated in the battles of Patras, in the repelling of the army of Dramali Pasha and in the military operations in Central Greece. He eventually rose to head his own military force and in 1823 he was appointed a lieutenant general. During the Greek civil wars of 1823\u201325 , although initially he took the side of Londos, he shifted to support the government faction of Georgios Kountouriotis . In 1824 he was promoted to general. Later, he participated in the operations against the army of Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt , and the subjugation of the regions of the Peloponnese that had surrendered to the Ottomans. Meletopoulos participated actively in the Third and Fifth National assemblies in the following years. He continued in politics in the independent Greek state, where he was elected as mayor of Aigio. He was appointed as Minister of the Interior, Minister of Military Affairs, and twice served as prefect of the Attica and Boeotia Prefecture . During the reign of King Otto of Greece , Meletopoulos was appointed lieutenant general in the regular army. He died in 1858 in Athens from apoplexy (or stroke). At the end of his life, he was destitute. From his marriage to a daughter of Anagnostis Deligiannis , he had three sons: Leonidas, Angelos and Charilaos.

{"id": "doc_random_081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Elodia_Ghinescu", "text": "The disappearance of Elodia Ghinescu was a heavily covered missing-person-become-murder case in Romania , according to several news sources, it was the most covered case of this kind in the history of mass media in the country. Background Ghinescu (born September 27, 1968) was a lawyer, whose disappearance and alleged murder in August of 2007 led to her husband, policeman Cristian Cioac\u0103, being arrested on December 5, 2012. The two got married on July 18, 2004 and had a baby boy named Patrick in January 2005. Cioac\u0103 was sentenced on July 2, 2013 to 22 years in jail, although he continues to maintain his innocence. The case is still undergoing the appeals process; most recently, on December 3, 2013, the High Court of Cassation and Justice decided that Cioac\u0103 should remain in custody while the appeals are ongoing. According to the prosecution, the motive for the murder was jealousy caused by an extramarital affair that Ghinescu had; her disappearance occurred right after she returned from a trip to Dubai with her alleged lover, a former SPP officer, who testified in court to their relationship. Cioac\u0103 examined her e-mails to search for evidence that she was cheating, without her permission. He tried to hide the blood stains in their apartment by painting the walls. A dirty police uniform, pictures with Ghinescu and her son, a perfume bottle and a pair of blood-stained gloves were found on 8 October, somewhere between Poiana Bra\u0219ov and R\u00e2\u0219nov . She was officially declared missing on February 12, 2009. Although Ghinescu's body was never found, the prosecution invoked forensic evidence , including blood droplets found in the couple's apartment and on a number of objects formerly found in the apartment, later discovered in a ravine . Media coverage Several television stations were officially warned by the National Audiovisual Council (the Romanian telecommunications agency) for their inappropriate coverage of the case, and some of them, including OTV and Curier TV , were fined for their unbalanced coverage. The 2009 Media Sustainability Index noted that \"From 2007 to 2008, OTV organized several hundred so-called episodes about the disappearance of Elodia Ghinescu, a lawyer who married a police officer. In one episode, Diaconescu [the OTV owner/host] instigated a hacker to break into Ghinescu\u2019s e-mail inbox and show her personal messages on the air. Meanwhile, the mainstream media took over the case and followed OTV\u2019s example in revealing personal details about her family.\" Indeed, while OTV profited greatly from the cases, doubling its viewing numbers a few months after beginning to cover the disappearance, more established channels also contributed to the media circus . Pro TV launched a screenwriting contest named \"Elodia's Enigma\", promising to turn the winning entry into a film, with over 2000 people submitting their version. Reactions Ghinescu became a popular icon, although she continues to be missing. She has been described as becoming a part of Romanian folklore or even \"being turned into a brand\". A browser game with the title Find Elodia! enjoyed popularity, while her disappearance even became the subject of stadium chants at football matches. Writer Radu Paraschivescu described the Ghinescu case having become \"the codename for a massive operation of prostituting the idea of television\".

{"id": "doc_random_082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_Burrell", "text": "The Burrell Collection, Glasgow Constance Mary Lockhart, Lady Burrell ( n\u00e9e Mitchell; 1875\u20131961) was a Scottish businesswoman, art collector and philanthropist. She was married to Glasgow ship owner and art collector Sir William Burrell . Their collection is displayed at the Burrell Collection museum in Glasgow. Biography Constance Mary Lockhart Mitchell was born in 1875 in Hamilton, Lanarkshire. She was the daughter of the leading merchant and shipowner James Lockhart Mitchell. By 1881 her family had moved to a fashionable townhouse at 10 Great Western Terrace, Glasgow. When her father died in 1893, she inherited a large part of his fortune. On 19 September 1901, she married the prominent Glasgow ship owner and art collector William Burrell. They were married at the Westbourne United Free Church, Glasgow. They set up home at 8 Great Western Terrace where they had one child, Marion, born on 6 August 1902. In 1927, they moved to Hutton Castle in Berwickshire. When William Burrell was knighted in 1927, she became known as Constance, Lady Burrell. Business Interests This ship was built at the SS Strathardle in 1910. Constance Burrell owned 5 shares in the Strathardle Steam Ship Co. Ltd. Constance was a major investor in the Burrell & Son shipping company. She held shares in most of the ships built after 1904 and was one of the principal proposers in the establishment of all but two of the 32 single-ship companies managed by Burrell & Son. She acquired additional shares following the death of her mother in law, Isabella Burrell in 1912. She was accused of acting on her husband's behalf in this sale, but the court decreed that she had acted on her own behalf, using her own estate and that it was her own business decision. After William and Constance moved to Hutton Castle the estate was divided into individual private limited companies. Constance was appointed chairman of the three companies. The Hutton Estate Company Ltd was the largest, with a capital of \u00a316,100. The Blackburn Estate Company had a capital of \u00a38,100 and the Whiterig Estate Company \u00a36,100. At the time of her death in 1961 she was described as a property owner and her estate was valued at \u00a342,542. Art Collecting Constance shared William's love of art. She grew up in a house where art was appreciated and later started collecting in her own right. She was particularly interested in textiles, especially lace. In 1917 she lent some lace items to an exhibition of antique furniture, tapestries and 'allied domestic arts' that Robert Lorimer had organised in Edinburgh for the aid of Edenhall Hostel in Kelso, for limbless sailors and soldiers. In 1934 she lent an old Venetian Reticella work chalice veil made in the late 17th century to an exhibition of old silver and lace in Hawick Town Hall in aid of the Scottish Women's Rural Institute . Her collection was later assimilated into the overall Burrell Collection. The two shared a passion for collecting and Constance played an active role in developing the collection. In his will Burrell was very particular in stating: 'I have had the benefit of my wife's help in many ways including financial help and have received from her the greatest assistance and most wholehearted support in forming the collection . . . it is my desire that it be distinctly understood that the entire gift is from my wife and myself and that her name shall always be associated with mine and shall receive full acknowledgement in all official literature relating to the collection'. In the years after Sir William's death, Constance continued to keep an eye on auction catalogues for potential additions. She was very knowledgeable about art and antiquities and used her expert judgement to assess the suitability of items proposed for purchase by the museum, rejecting some items on the grounds of quality, date, or their appeal to her and Sir William's taste. Charitable Work Constance was greatly interested in matters relating to health and was actively involved in a variety of charitable causes. Her interest in social and medical affairs can be seen in her membership of the Berwickshire Committee of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and she later became vice-president of the Chirnside and District Nursing Association. This was a local branch of the British Nurses Association , which united nurses who sought professional registration. She also fundraised for the Scottish Children's League of Pity, which was affiliated with the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. She also became chair of the local Red Cross Society. In 1928 she offered a gift of \u00a310,000 to purchase one gramme of radium for the Glasgow Royal Cancer Hospital. This initiative came through the persuasion of Sir George Beatson , head of the hospital and one of the country's leading oncologists. Her gift enabled the establishment of the Glasgow and West of Scotland Radium Institute in 1930, now known as the Beatson Cancer Research Institute. She also paid for the building of a new parish church hall in Hutton village , Berwickshire. At the opening ceremony in 1931 William Burrell made the gift on Constance's behalf, stating that handing over the hall to the parish was 'a great pleasure to his wife, and she hoped that the hall would prove not only useful, but a joy to themselves and all their neighbours'. The Rev. D. S. Leslie, chairman of the hall, responded to the gift by saying that it was one of the happiest moments of his life to receive 'the most generous gift of such a beautiful hall'. Every year thereafter Constance hosted a Christmas party in the hall for the parishioners, with lively entertainment, refreshments and presents for the children. In 1944 she and Sir William gifted their collection to the city of Glasgow. Health Concerns Constance did not have an easy birth and she suffered terribly as a result. She endured great physical pain and developed what we now call postnatal depression. A couple of years later Constance had to have an operation on her kidney and again had a long and difficult convalescence. As a result, Constance was to suffer physical and mental ill health for the rest of her life. She later suffered from phlebitis, an inflammation of the veins and in 1932 she underwent a series of operations which took a long time to recover from. She often travelled to continental Europe for periodic rest cures. As William Burrell explained: 'warm weather is my wife's best friend and cold her worst'. During the 1930s they regularly spent the winter months in Jamaica. Prolonged ill health compromised Constance socially and after years of declining health, she died of heart failure on 15 August 1961 at Hutton Castle, aged 85. She is buried in Largs.

{"id": "doc_random_083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imiquimod", "text": "Imiquimod , sold under the brand name Aldara among others, is a medication that acts as an immune response modifier that is used to treat genital warts , superficial basal cell carcinoma , and actinic keratosis . Scientists at 3M 's pharmaceuticals division discovered the drug and 3M obtained the first FDA approval in 1997. As of 2015, imiquimod is generic and is available worldwide under many brands. In 2021, it was the 290th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 600,000 prescriptions. Medical uses Imiquimod is a patient-applied cream prescribed to treat genital warts , Bowens disease ( squamous cell carcinoma in situ), and, secondary to surgery, for basal cell carcinoma , as well as actinic keratosis . Imiquimod 5% cream is indicated for the topical treatment of: external genital and perianal warts (condylomata acuminata) in adults; small superficial basal-cell carcinomas (sBCCs) in adults; clinically typical, non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic actinic keratoses (AKs) on the face or scalp in immunocompetent adults when size or number of lesions limit the efficacy and / or acceptability of cryotherapy and other topical treatment options are contraindicated or less appropriate. Imiquimod 3.75% cream is indicated for the topical treatment of clinically typical, non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic, visible or palpable actinic keratosis of the full face or balding scalp in immunocompetent adults when other topical treatment options are contraindicated or less appropriate. Side effects Side effects include local inflammatory reactions, such as blisters, a burning sensation, skin redness, dry skin, itching, skin breakdown, skin crusting or scabbing, skin drainage, skin flaking or scaling, skin ulceration, sores, swelling, as well as systemic reactions, such as fever, \"flu-like\" symptoms, headache, and tiredness. People who have had an organ transplant and are taking immune-suppressing drugs should not use imiquimod. Mechanism of action Imiquimod yields profound antitumoral activity by acting on several immunological levels synergistically. Imiquimod stimulates the innate immune system by activating toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), commonly involved in pathogen recognition. Cells activated by imiquimod via TLR-7 secrete cytokines (primarily interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)). There is evidence that imiquimod, when applied to skin, can lead to the activation of Langerhans cells , which subsequently migrate to local lymph nodes to activate the adaptive immune system . Other cell types activated by imiquimod include natural killer cells , macrophages and B-lymphocytes . Imiquimod exerts its effect by increasing levels of the opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr). In experiments, blocking OGFr function with siRNA technology resulted in loss of any antiproliferative effect of imiquimod. History Scientists at 3M's pharmaceutical division discovered imiquimod as part of a program to discover inhibitors of herpes simplex virus replication based on a known adenine derivative. 3M obtained the first FDA approval for it in 1997 as a treatment for external genital and perianal warts under the brand \"Aldara\". In 2004, 3M obtained FDA approval to market imiquimod as a treatment for superficial basal cell carcinoma . In 2006, 3M sold its pharmaceutical business in the Americas to Graceway Pharmaceuticals , its European pharmaceutical business to Meda AB , and its pharmaceutical business in other territories to two private equity firms. Graceway declared bankruptcy in 2011, after the expiration of the patents on imiquimod, and its assets, including the rights to imiquimod branding and approvals in the Americas, were purchased by Medicis Pharmaceutical . Imiquimod 5% was approved for medical use in the European Union in September 1998. Imiquimod 3.75% was approved for medical use in the European Union in August 2012. As of 2015, imiquimod is generic and is available worldwide under many brands. Research One randomized double-blind Phase III clinical study found clearance of genital warts (an FDA-approved indication) improved from 9% with placebo to 24.9% with 3.75% imiquimod cream applied for up to eight weeks. Imiquimod has been tested for treatment of molluscum contagiosum . Two large randomized controlled trials, however, found no evidence of effectiveness of imiquimod in treating children with molluscum contagiosum, and concerning adverse effects were also noted. These disprove earlier anecdotal claims and smaller, less reliable studies. Imiquimod has also been tested for treatment of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia , vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia , common warts (a 2012 Cochrane review found no randomized controlled trials), plantar warts , warts in people with suppressed immune systems, flat warts on face and neck, and warts under and around fingernails and toenails. As of 2014, insufficient evidence exists to recommend treatment of warts (other than genital warts) with imiquimod, due to the small size of and lack of controls in existing studies.

It ran from Washington D.C. to Chicago , Illinois , through Baltimore , Harrisburg and Pittsburgh . It began running on September 27, 1925, as a replacement for the Washington\u2013Broadway Limited , which had been introduced in 1923. It originally was scheduled to complete its route in 19 hours. In June 1938 it became one of the original trains making up the Pennsylvania Railroad's \"Fleet of Modernism\", using modern streamlined lightweight equipment, along with the General , the Broadway Limited and the Spirit of St. Louis . Beside streamlining, its travel time was reduced to 16 hours 25 mins; 30 mins slower than B&O's premier train the Royal Blue. The train consisted of one lounge Car (Drawing-room, three Double Bedrooms, Buffet), a 14 sections heavyweight Pullman sleeper, a 12-5 and a 10-5 lightweight Pullman sleeper, one dining car, one coach with reclining seat which was regularly assigned, an observation car with two master bedrooms, one double bedroom and a buffet lounge. Prime power was PRR K4s , PRR S1 #6100, T1s and diesel engines. Its primary competition were the Baltimore & Ohio 's Royal Blue and Capitol Limited . It last ran on October 27, 1957, after which its equipment was moved to the Chicago\u2013New York General , which also picked up a leg connecting from Harrisburg to Washington, D.C.

The train was created from Levin's historic private stock and joined with private cars from other supporters. The Army-Navy Liberty Limited run was repeated in later years (2006, 2010 ). A 2005 Ronnie Polaneczky, Liberty Limited, Philadelphia Daily News story was reprinted in 2015 as a photo blog by Michael Froio. The Army-Navy commemorative train runs were the subject of a 2017 podcast interview with Bennet Levin on YouTube: Honoring Our Veterans: The Story of the Liberty Limited Special . The 2005 Polaneczky story has been the source of a 'the media never tells' fake news campaign, where the 2005 article is repeated but the game date is changed to a recent year.

It was directed by Eric Armstrong, produced by Jacquie Barnbrook, and written by Jeff Wolverton. The ChubbChubbs! won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 2003. Plot Meeper, the janitor of an alien pub called the Ale-E-Inn, has higher aspirations\u2014a karaoke performer. After he accidentally electrocutes a singer, he is ejected from the pub. Outside, he is told by an incautious Gungan that \"The ChubbChubbs are coming!\" Meeper sees aircraft land in the distance, and huge, weapon-bearing monsters exit the craft. He assumes these are the ChubbChubbs. Meeper rushes to warn the pub, and some chicks he finds pecking at the ground outside, but each of his attempts further injures the singer. Once the patrons are finally warned by a different visitor, the pub is promptly emptied due to said patrons taking off in panic, leaving Meeper behind during the process. When the monsters begin closing in to the pub, Meeper hides four chicks under his bucket in an attempt to save them. He then launches into a rendition of \" Why Can't We Be Friends? \" until, caught up in the song, he accidentally trips over the bucket, revealing the chicks. The monsters flee, screaming, \"It's the ChubbChubbs!\" The chicks reveal their razor sharp teeth and devour the monsters, who are actually known as Zyzaks. They gather around Meeper, who says, \"So... You guys into karaoke?\" As the credits roll, Meeper and the ChubbChubbs sing a rewrite of Aretha Franklin 's \" Respect \" in the pub. When the song is finished, there is dead silence. The ChubbChubbs glare and reveal their teeth in a sense of threat, and the crowd hastily bursts into applause.

{"id": "doc_random_086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.nl", "text": "This article is about the top-level domain .nl. For the file format, see nl (format) . Logo of Stichting Internet Domeinregistratie Nederland , which administers the domain .nl is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Netherlands . It is one of the most popular ccTLDs with over six million registered .nl domains as of 29\u00a0September\u00a02020 . When cwi.nl was registered by Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica on 1986-05-01, .nl became the first active ccTLD outside the United States . Registry Since 31 January 1996, .nl domains are registered by the Stichting Internet Domeinregistratie Nederland (SIDN, in English: Foundation for Internet Domain Registration Netherlands), based in Arnhem . Most registrars are Internet service providers , IT service bureaus and media service bureaus, but several large enterprises with many brand names have also become a registrar, or participant as SIDN calls them, which is a quite uncommon phenomenon in the domain name industry. Registrars have to pay SIDN a fee for each domain since 1 April 1996, until then registration was free. SIDN does not deal directly with registrants. In the early days, most of the registrants were universities and research departments of large companies, such as Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium . Second-level domains Official second-level domains do not exist. A number of companies have taken the opportunity to register domains like co.nl and com.nl, using them to sell third-level domains. These are not affiliated with SIDN. Individuals were allowed to register a second-level .nl domain since 2003. As a forerunner, individuals were allowed to register a third-level domain since 2000. Such 'personal domains' had the form of janjansen.123.nl . They never became popular, and registration has been suspended since 2006. Because there were only around 500 of such domains registered, in contrast to about 5 million second-level domains, SIDN announced the discontinuance of personal domains as of 2008 on 4 July 2007. Technical limitations Unlike the majority of top level domains , .nl requires each nameserver to use a unique IP address . There must be at least two nameservers set, meaning at least two different IP addresses must be used. Other TLDs with this requirement are .ca and .cn .

Events The hotel opened with an evening event on Sunday 1 June 1969. Around 400 guests attended the event, including Solomon Islands politician Tommy Chan's father Chan Wing. During the April and May riots of 2006 in Honiara , Sir Tommy Chan (owner of the Honiara Hotel and a naturalized citizen of the Solomon Islands ), the hotel, and his son's shop were targeted. However, they escaped damage and destruction due to support from local islanders, the Christian brotherhood, and the police. Facilities and Services The Honiara Hotel offers a range of comforts and services for guests. Rooms usually include air conditioning , a private bathroom, and a balcony. Independent travel and hotel profiles also mention extra features like a wardrobe, an electric kettle, and a work desk. Guests can use various services at the property, including an airport shuttle , a 24-hour front desk, housekeeping, room service, and free private parking on site. The hotel has several facilities for leisure and dining. According to independent travel profiles, there is a restaurant , a bar , and an swimming pool outdoors, along with other on-site amenities that support guests during their stay. These kinds of features are common in full-service hotels in Honiara and are designed to suit both long-term and short-term visitors. History and Development Historical research on tourism in the Solomon Islands shows that visitor accommodation in Honiara grew as the capital expanded after the Second World War . In this period, a small hotel in Honiara\u2019s Chinatown area, where the Honiara Hotel now stands, was one of the early accommodation places that later developed into the modern hotel. This shows the wider pattern of post-war growth in the city\u2019s hospitality and tourism infrastructure. The Honiara Hotel in Chinatown popped up during a time when tourism spots were slowly expanding in the Solomon Islands. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, small resorts and guesthouses had been set up in places like Guadalcanal , due to the increasing number of international visitors. These new accommodations contribute to the growth of tourism in Honiara and its surroundings.

{"id": "doc_random_089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrington_Borough_Council", "text": "Warrington Borough Council is the local authority of the Borough of Warrington , a local government district in the ceremonial county of Cheshire , England. Warrington has had a borough council since 1847, which has been reformed on several occasions. Since 1998 the council has been a unitary authority , being a district council which also performs the functions of a county council . The council has been under Labour majority control since 2011. It meets at Warrington Town Hall and has its main offices at 1 Time Square. History The town of Warrington was made a municipal borough in 1847, governed by a body formally called the \"mayor, aldermen and burgesses of the borough of Warrington\", generally known as the corporation, town council or borough council. This first incarnation of the borough council replaced an earlier body of improvement commissioners which had governed the town since 1813. From its creation in 1847 the borough straddled Lancashire and Cheshire , with the county boundary being the River Mersey ; the town centre and most of the built-up area was on the north bank of the river in Lancashire, but the borough also included the built-up parts of Latchford on the south bank of the river in Cheshire. In 1889 boroughs which straddled county boundaries were placed entirely in the county which had the majority of the population, and so the part of the borough south of the Mersey was transferred from Cheshire to Lancashire. The borough boundaries were subsequently enlarged on several occasions, notably in 1890, 1933 and 1954. In 1900 Warrington was made a county borough , making it independent from Lancashire County Council , whilst remaining part of Lancashire for ceremonial purposes. The borough was substantially enlarged in 1974, taking in a number of surrounding parishes from both Lancashire and Cheshire, including Lymm , which had been a separate urban district . The enlarged borough was transferred from Lancashire to Cheshire and was redesignated as a non-metropolitan district , with Cheshire County Council providing county-level services. The borough council regained control of county-level functions 24 years later in 1998. The way this change was implemented was by creating a new non-metropolitan county called Warrington covering the borough, but with no separate county council. Instead, the existing borough council took on county council functions, making it a unitary authority. It remains part of Cheshire for ceremonial purposes. Governance As a unitary authority, Warrington Borough Council has the functions of a county council and district council combined. In its capacity as a district council it is a billing authority collecting Council Tax and business rates, it processes local planning applications, it is responsible for housing , waste collection and environmental health. In its capacity as a county council it is a local education authority , responsible for social services, libraries and waste disposal. Parts of the borough are also covered by civil parishes , which form a second tier of local government for their areas. Political control The council has been under Labour majority control since 2011. Political control of the council since the 1974 reforms has been as follows: Non-metropolitan district Unitary authority Leadership The role of Mayor of Warrington is largely ceremonial. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council . The leaders since 1985 have been: The Mayors since 1998 have been: The Mayor's role is to perform civic duties across the Borough, such as attending large events in different communities and taking the lead on certain recognised days, such as Remembrance Sunday. The Mayor has no power over policies, as that is the job of the Leader. The Mayor also chairs Full Council meetings. Though elected as a Councillor representing a particular Party, the Mayor remains impartial when chairing but also has a vote of their own (often voting with their Party line). Composition Following the 2024 election , plus a defection from the Labour administration in October 2024, and a by-election in Bewsey and Whitecross ward in July 2025 ward, the composition of the council was: The next elections are due in May 2028. Elections See also: Warrington Borough Council elections Since the last boundary changes in 2016 the council has comprised 58 councillors representing 22 wards , with each ward electing two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years. Premises The council generally meets at Warrington Town Hall on Sankey Street. The building was originally built in 1750 as a large house, and was formerly called Bank Hall. It was bought by the borough council in 1870 and converted into a town hall, with its grounds becoming a public park. The council's main offices are at 1 Time Square which was completed in 2020, replacing earlier offices at New Town House on Scotland Road which have since been demolished. Investments Elected members have approved a number of significant commercial investments by the local authority. In September 2016, Warrington Borough Council became one of the first local councils in the UK to buy clean-tech bonds in Swindon Solar Park through its owner, specialist investment management firm Rockfire Capital . In September 2019, the council acquired a 50% shareholding in Clydebank-based energy retailer Together Energy for \u00a318m. In September 2020, Bristol Energy 's brand and residential accounts \u2013 155,000 meter points \u2013 were sold by Bristol City Council to Together Energy for \u00a314 million. In August 2021, Warrington Council's total financial exposure to Together Energy was reported to be \u00a341.2m. In October 2021, Ofgem issued a provisional order to several suppliers, including Together Energy, who had not made Renewables Obligation payments; Together Energy's obligation was over \u00a312m. Following sharp increases in wholesale gas and electricity prices which began in autumn 2021, Together Energy Retail Ltd announced on 18 January 2022 that it was ceasing to trade. Other loans and investments include almost \u00a330 million paid in stages between 2017 and 2019 for a 33% stake in Redwood Bank, a \" challenger bank \" which has a Warrington office. In 2021 a \u00a3202m loan facility, secured against commercial property, was provided to Matt Moulding , founder of Cheshire-based e-commerce business The Hut Group . In September 2021, the council confirmed that its borrowing had reached \u00a31.7 billion, but that the current value of its investment assets were \u00a32.173 billion. In May 2024, just after the local election , it was announced by the Government that they had commissioned a \"Best Value\" inspection into the council's finances. In June 2024 Moody's Ratings withdrew its credit rating from the council after it failed to provide accounts signed-off by an auditor. In January 2025, S&P Global Ratings gave the council a BBB+ credit rating with a stable outlook. References ^ \"Warrington welcomes new Mayor\" . Warrington Borough Council .

Biography He was born in 1799 at Darlington , County Durham to Charlotte Key and her husband Anthony Hall, the latter dying later the same year. At the age of thirteen he successfully claimed the estate of his distant cousin Sir Frank Standish, Bt., (as the great grandson of Margaret Standish, Sir Frank's aunt), which included the manor of Duxbury and Duxbury Hall near Chorley , Lancashire . He attained the right to bear his benefactor's surname and arms, but failed in his attempts to succeed to the baronetcy which was extinguished. During his adult years Standish travelled extensively on the continent, spending much of his very substantial income on the purchase of art works and books. He lived chiefly in Seville . He published a number of long poems, and books of travel and topography. Frank Hall Standish died in 1840 at C\u00e1diz , unmarried and probably without issue, and was buried in the Standish crypt at St Laurence's, Chorley. The manor of Duxbury and the estates passed to his second cousin, William Standish Carr. \"Piqued at the English ministry's refusal to revive the baronetcy\", however, or \"as a mark of respect to the French\" he gave his book and art collections to the French king Louis Philippe . Until the revolution of 1848 , the art works were displayed in the Standish gallery in the Louvre . Subsequently, Louis Philippe reclaimed them as his private property and the whole was sold in 1852\u20133, the drawings, etc., in Paris and the paintings in London. The books passed to his son, Henri d'Orl\u00e9ans, duc d'Aumale and formed part of the collection which he bequeathed to the Institut de France along with the Ch\u00e2teau de Chantilly .

Biography Giovanni Ludovico Bianconi was born in Bologna in 1717. His brother Carlo Bianconi , a neoclassical painter of some reputation, served as secretary to the Brera Academy , Milan. He graduated in 1741 from the University of Bologna in philosophy and medicine and between 1743 and 1744 translated Jacob B. Winslow \u2019s treatise on anatomy , Exposition anatomique de la structure du corps humain . From 1744 he served as doctor to Louis VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt , and following this, from 1750, to Frederick-Augustus II, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland. Between 1748 and 1749 Bianconi founded, and thereafter published, the Journal des savans d\u2019Italie , which discussed the latest ideas in scientific and literary studies in Italy. Frederick-Augustus commissioned him to purchase in Italy artworks for the Dresden Gem\u00e4ldegalerie , the most famous acquisition being Raphael \u2019s Sistine Madonna (c. 1512\u201314), bought in 1753. During this period Bianconi consolidated friendships with many artists and men of letters. His connections were strongest in Bologna, even among picture dealers who were his rivals in supplying Dresden, and in Florence, through Ignazio Hugford . During the Seven Years' War he followed Crown Prince (later Elector) Frederick-Christian of Saxony , first to Prague and then to Munich , where he wrote his Lettere al marchese Filippo Hercolani , a brief treatise on the artistic beauties of Munich. Works In the changed atmosphere and straightened finances following the Seven Years' War , Bianconi found it time to return to Italy. He accepted the honorary appointment of Saxony\u2019s minister to the Holy See , and he spent the rest of his life in Rome. There he devoted himself exclusively to the study of antiquities and the fine arts. His most important writing on antiquities was the disquisition on the Baths of Caracalla , Descrizione dei circhi particolarmente di quello di Caracalla (1789). Also of importance are his pages of art criticism in which he expounded ideas heavily influenced by Neoclassical poetics. He also published extensively Winckelmann's reports from Herculaneum . Among his published work were a book on Piranesi (1779), Anton Raphael Mengs (1780). His Scritti tedeschi (1763) sent from Dresden to Marchese Filippo Hercolani and to Francesco Algarotti , described the assembly and furnishing of the Electoral paintings gallery, with which Algarotti had been closely concerned. These Scritti tedeschi were edited and set in their historical context by Giovanna Perini (Argelato, 1998). Writings Elogio storico del cav. Giambattista Piranesi (Rome, 1779).

{"id": "doc_random_094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroluminescent_display", "text": "1966 Dodge Charger Electroluminescent Instrument Cluster Electroluminescent displays ( ELDs ) are a type of flat panel display created by sandwiching a layer of electroluminescent material such as gallium arsenide between two layers of conductors. When current flows, the layer of material emits radiation in the form of visible light. Electroluminescence (EL) is an optical and electrical phenomenon where a material emits light in response to an electric current passed through it, or to a strong electric field. The term \"electroluminescent display\" describes displays that use neither LED nor OLED devices, that instead use traditional electroluminescent materials. Beneq is the only manufacturer of TFEL (Thin Film Electroluminescent Display) and TAESL displays, which are branded as LUMINEQ Displays. The structure of a TFEL is similar to that of a passive matrix LCD or OLED display, and TAESL displays are essentially transparent TEFL displays with transparent electrodes. TAESL displays can have a transparency of 80%. Both TEFL and TAESL displays use chip-on-glass technology, which mounts the display driver IC directly on one of the edges of the display. TAESL displays can be embedded onto glass sheets. Unlike LCDs, TFELs are much more rugged and can operate at temperatures from \u221260 to 105 \u00a0 \u00b0C and unlike OLEDs, TFELs can operate for 100,000 hours without considerable burn-in, retaining about 85% of their initial brightness. The electroluminescent material is deposited using atomic layer deposition, which is a process that deposits one 1-atom thick layer at a time. Mechanism EL works by exciting atoms by passing an electric current through them, causing them to emit photons . By varying the material being excited, the colour of the light emitted can be changed. The actual ELD is constructed using flat, opaque electrode strips running parallel to each other, covered by a layer of electroluminescent material, followed by another layer of electrodes, running perpendicular to the bottom layer. This top layer must be transparent in order to let light escape. At each intersection, the material lights, creating a pixel. Uses Electroluminescent (EL) displays have been a niche format and are rarely used nowadays. Some uses have included the Apollo Guidance Computer 7-segment numerical displays, to indicate speed and altitude at the front of the Concorde , and as floor indicators on Otis Elevators from around 1989 to 2007, mostly only available to high-rise buildings and modernizations. EL displays have a wider operating temperature range than LED displays.

{"id": "doc_random_096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Au_nom_de_la_rose", "text": "\" Au Nom de la rose \" is a 1999 song recorded by French singer Moos . The song was released on 13 April 1999 as the second single from his sole album Le Crabe est \u00e9rotique . It became a smash hit in France and Belgium (Wallonia) where it remained for several months atop of the singles chart. Song information The song is a partly cover version in French-language of the Francis Lai song (Where Do I Begin?) Love Story , originally recorded as theme song for the 1970 movie Love Story directed by Arthur Hiller . Only the chorus is similar, and the lyrics are changed and deal with loss and love in a sensual way. The lyrics were written by Moos, and Lai's music reworked by Moos and Pascal Castro. The song has been added to many French compilations such as Hit Express 8 , Hit Connection \u2013 Best Of 1999 (released as the time of the song), and Top 50\u00a0: 20 ans de tubes Vol. 1 (2007). It has also been included on Hits de diamant , a best of containing big hits in France. Chart performance In France, the song debuted at No. 6 on SNEP chart on 17 April 1999. It reached number one three weeks later and stayed there for nine consecutive weeks. It remained for 17 weeks in the top ten, 23 weeks in the top 50 and 29 weeks in the top 100. It achieved Diamond status after about two months and half and was the third best-selling single of 1999. In Belgium (Wallonia), the song was very successful too: it started at #24 on the Ultratop 40 on 15 May 1999, climbed to #5 and eventually topped the chart for eight weeks, before dropping. It totaled 14 weeks in the top ten and 21 weeks in the top 40. The song was ranked No. 2 on the annual chart.

{"id": "doc_random_097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_molybdate", "text": "Silver molybdate is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula Ag 2 MoO 4 . It is a yellow solid that crystallizes in the cubic system and exhibits dimorphism . It is often used in glass. Structure Silver molybdate crystals present two types of electronic structure, depending on the pressure conditions to which the crystal is subjected. At room temperature, it exhibits a spinel-type cubic structure, known as \u03b2-Ag 2 MoO 4 , which is more stable in nature. However, when exposed to high hydrostatic pressure, the tetragonal \u03b1-Ag 2 MoO 4 forms as a metastable phase. Synthesis and properties \u03b1-Ag2MoO4 \u03b1-Ag 2 MoO 4 can be prepared by solution-phase precipitation under ambient conditions, using 3-bis(2-pyridyl)pyrazine (dpp) as a doping agent . The pH of the starting solution influences the growth and formation processes of distinct heterostructures (brooms, flowers and rods). \u03b2-Ag2MoO4 \u03b2-Ag 2 MoO 4 crystals can be prepared by solid-state reaction or oxide mixture at high temperature, melt-quenching, and Czochralski growth . Additional methods include co-precipitation , microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis , a dynamic template route using polymerization of acrylamide assisted templates, and an impregnation/ calcination method. \u03b2-Ag 2 MoO 4 microcrystals can be synthesized by precipitation employing polar solvents . Photocatalytic properties of \u03b2\u2013Ag 2 MoO 4 crystals can be improved through hydrothermal processing at different temperatures. The replacement of Ag atoms with Zn to form silver-zinc molybdate [\u03b2\u2013(Ag 2\u22122x Znx)MoO 4 ] microcrystals by a sonochemical method also leads to improvements. These crystals are able to degrade rhodamine B and Remazol Brilliant Violet 5R. Ag-Ag2MoO4 composites Ag-Ag 2 MoO 4 composites can be prepared by microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis. These composites present photocatalytic activity for the degradation of rhodamine B under visible light. Other properties Ag 2 MoO 4 mixed with graphite acts as a good lubricant for Ni-based composites, improving the tribological properties of the system. References ^ Arora, A.

{"id": "doc_random_101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_McKeeby", "text": "Byron Gordon McKeeby (1936-1984) was an American artist, educator and master printmaker known primarily for lithography . McKeeby's interest dovetailed with a burgeoning contemporary community in advancing lithography as an art form. He was active in all form of print exhibition. He built a full scope printmaking department of rank at the University of Tennessee that exists today. Biography Early years McKeeby, son of Byron J. and Miriam McKeeby, was born on February 27, 1936, in Humboldt, Iowa , later growing up in Cedar Rapids , IA. Growing up after the Great Depression and during the World War II 1940s, McKeeby knew the hardships of the day, particularly after his father died while he was still a teenager. McKeeby's youth, however, was enriched by his mother's interest in art, particularly Rosa Bonheur . McKeeby was the grandson of Byron H. McKeeby, a Cedar Rapids dentist, who posed as the farmer in Grant Wood's American Gothic . Ultimately he referenced this relationship in an untitled, uneditioned lithograph (embedded with the wording 'The American Farmer Can Grow Just About Anything') known to be from 1984, which features his grandfather, Byron H. McKeeby's image. Education Like his parents, McKeeby was a Coe College graduate and while at Coe he became interested in art through Professor Marvin Cone , who was a lifelong friend of painter Grant Wood . Years later in a Coe College interview McKeeby acknowledged that Cone was \"an extraordinary human, and a lasting influence on his life\". Upon graduating Coe College in 1959 he proceeded to the Art Institute of Chicago where he studied painting, graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1963. Several of his class contemporaries, one of which was Jim Nutt , ultimately formed The Hairy Who , a group reflective of the 1960s independence of American art. Subsequently, McKeeby earned a Master of Fine Arts at Tulane University studying with innovative printmaker Jim Steg , it was there his interest and rising success as a lithographer was realized. His Master's thesis paper focused on the macabre in art, entitled, \"The Grotesque as a Positive Element in Art\". A representative image from that time is \"Okina\". Post M.F.A. McKeeby was awarded a Tamarind Institute Artist-Teacher Fellow in 1965 where he was mentored by Garo Antreasian deepening his interest and expertise in Lithography . During this time two lithographic prints, Monogatari and Okina, were produced. McKeeby detailed his work as found in the Tamarind Print Record Archives. The record includes the specifics of the lithographic limestone grain, transfer and drawing materials, notes on etching and printing as well as notes of any surface treatment. McKeeby credits Antreasian (co-author of The Tamarind Book of Lithography; Art & Technique) with an 'acid tint' method. The record of edition printing reveals specific color runs, paper types such as Arches paper , and the print edition including proofs such as bon \u00e0 tirer, printer's, Artist's proof , trial, Tamarind, cancellation, or presentation proofs as well as the final edition size. The records also reveal the artist's creative hand side-by-side with the rigor of producing professional prints. Particular to McKeeby, the Tamarind record shows his interest in experimentation as part of the creative process. This approach became visible in the span of his life's art work and his approach in teaching. McKeeby\u2019s Tamarind edition lithographs also fell under the Tamarind Collector\u2019s Agreement (1961-1965), where the first seven sets were sold to collectors with six month subscriptions. The guiding principles of the Tamarind Institute of creating master artist-printers, embracing diversity of style and fostering collaboration were employed in Fall of 1965 when McKeeby joined the University of Tennessee , Knoxville, Art Department (now called the School of Art). There he became professor and head of the printmaking program until his death. Family McKeeby and Ana McKeeby were married from 1964 to 1981, with two sons. Upon McKeeby's death on November 3, 1984, in Knoxville, Tennessee of diabetes , he left sons Paulo and Neal, who had influenced his imagery. Career Educator As an educator, McKeeby taught all levels and aspects of printmaking during his tenure. Students in his printmaking classes learned lithography, engraving , viscosity printing , linocut , wood engraving , collagraphy , screen printing and monotyping . His expertise and teaching style was epitomized by then Art Department Head, Donald F. Kurka, as being 'dedicated to a professional standard of printmaking' and having 'a high tolerance toward divergent attitudes'. Influencing McKeeby was his education and contemporary printmakers pushing technical experimentation. In support of this McKeeby hosted workshops with academic and professional printmakers, such as Donald Saff , for student benefit. In 1981 the university built a new Art & Architecture building; it was opportunity for McKeeby to design a state-of-the-art printshop in support of teaching and creation. Subsequent Printmaking Professor, Beauvais Lyons, credited McKeeby's open studio design that accommodates traditional and experimental techniques in a 2015 statement \"The open plan encourages a climate of experimentation and the use of all techniques\". Further realization of the concept became part of \"the incorporation of computer methods in print education\". Artist McKeeby's work was dominated by black and white lithographs. His interest lead him to personally advance what had nearly become a dying art of stone lithography. Drawing was essential for McKeeby, evidenced in the retrospective exhibit title, however, he often used experimentation techniques such as acetone transfer of printed images. Early works incorporated transfer images with drawn compositions. His lifetime of work defied singular categorization; Art Historian Dale G Cleaver described McKeeby's art as 'posited dualities of existence: the contrasts of good and evil, compassion and violence, mechanical and organic, esoteric and mundane' which 'didn't fit any contemporary styles'. McKeeby's art was also referred to as puckish, mischievously playful. His interest spanned social issues, the natural world, language and through his personal use of imagery he achieved humor and satire. McKeeby's creative process was observed and commented upon by fellow printmaker, Brian R. Wells, as 'He was absorbed in the difference between improvisation and thinking a piece through'. Career-long McKeeby was active in exhibit competition and shown by invitation, his record was regional, national and international; he was awarded the Chairman's Prize at the 1983 International Biennial Print Exhibit ROC in Taipei, Taiwan . McKeeby was described as prodigious by fellow Art Department faculty F. Clark Stewart and in total McKeeby amassed 200 group exhibitions and 19 one\u2014man shows over twenty-two years. Posthumous Retrospective Indicative of McKeeby's energy and inertia, and at the time of his sudden death, the beginnings of an invitational show of printmakers and their student's work entitled \"Printmakers Select Printmakers\" was in progress. The Art Department with Gallery Directory Sam Yates' guidance from having worked with McKeeby on the invitational, realized the show in McKeeby's honor February 22- March 16, 1985. Donald F Kurka wrote in dedication \"Ironically, with his untimely death in November 1984, he unwittingly created his own memorial and final tribute to the major passion of his life: printmaking. It would be hard to imagine a more appropriate way to honor and exemplify his lifelong commitment to the field than to bring together the work of some of America's best printmakers and the work of some of their present and former students. His respect and support for his printmaking colleagues across the nation and, in turn, their influence on a new generation of printmakers demonstrate through the exhibition, Byron's devotion to printmaking in America and its future. His life's work centered around making prints, teaching others to make prints and supporting his fellow printmakers. An artist's artist, a teacher's teacher, as a totally committed colleague, Byron had few equals. His personal integrity and the force of his dedication made all of us work harder, be truer to the best in ourselves and, above all, make art, not just talk art. He selected this invitational show on those same principles - choosing people who are equally engaged in their art as demonstrated through the quality of what they produce.\" In 1986 the Ewing Gallery, School of Art at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, mounted a posthumous retrospective exhibit entitled Byron McKeeby\u00a0: prints and drawings from 1964-1984 held February 16 - March 20, 1986. The exhibit comprised sixty-six framed works selected from McKeeby's personal oeuvre by Art Historian Dale G. Cleaver who also wrote the catalog essay; the exhibit was coordinated by Gallery Director Sam Yates. After opening in Knoxville, the exhibit traveled primarily through the southeast. An exhibit catalog was produced featuring a six-page essay with 20 black and white plates. The color cover reproduction is of a 1979 McKeeby viscosity print, Untitled(frog). Additionally McKeeby was honored during the 20th Annual Southern Graphics Council Conference, March 19\u201321, 1992, with a show of thirty retrospective prints. A reception and talk, 'A Tribute To Byron McKeeby', by Dale Cleaver honored McKeeby's art, leadership, professional accomplishments, high standards and teaching. Great art concerns itself not with art, but with awakening the human consciousness to itself. \u2014\u200aByron McKeeby Permanent collections The largest repository of McKeeby artwork is browsable

History When the Brooklyn City Rail Road was granted franchises in 1853, one of them was through Furman Street from Atlantic Avenue north to Fulton Ferry. The City Railroad did not begin construction until late 1859; it was claimed by one side that this was only done after the Brooklyn Central and Jamaica Railroad threatened (and later received permission) to build it, and by the other side that the City Railroad had delayed until it was clear that the Central Railroad would stop using steam propulsion to South Ferry (which happened September 30, 1861). The line was opened by June 1860, and the Central Railroad also used it from their track on Atlantic Avenue, but only until September. In October, the Board of Aldermen decided that neither company had the right to use the tracks, since the City Railroad had been given a completion deadline of December 1, 1857, and that if the two companies did not come to an agreement within five days, the Central Railroad would have the right to operate trains in Furman Street. The City Railroad continued to operate A compromise was finally agreed to in late February 1861, in which the City Railroad would allow the Central Railroad to use the Furman Street Line, and the Central Railroad would allow the City Railroad to cross it at Furman Street and Atlantic Avenue.

Format The qualifying competition consists of five stages: Preliminary round : The lowest-ranked 24 teams play in the preliminary round, and are drawn into six groups of four teams. The winners and runners-up of each group advance to the main round to join the 24 highest-ranked teams which receive byes to the main round. Main round : The 36 teams are drawn into twelve groups of three. The 12 winners and four best runners-up progress directly to the elite round. The remaining eight runners-up enter main round play-offs. Main round play-offs : The eight teams are drawn into four ties, to be played home and away. The four winners of the ties complete the elite round line-up. Elite round : The 20 teams are drawn into five groups of four. The winners of each group qualify directly for the World Cup, while the four best runners-up advance to the play-offs. Elite round play-offs : The four teams are drawn into two ties to play home-and-away two-legged matches to determine the last two European qualified teams. If only two teams enter, a draw will be held to determine the order of matches. In the preliminary round each group is played as a round-robin mini-tournament at the pre-selected hosts. In the main and the elite round, each team plays one home and one away match against each other team in its group. Tiebreakers In the preliminary round teams are ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss), and if tied on points, the following tiebreaking criteria are applied, in the order given, to determine the rankings (Regulations Articles 15.01 and 15.02): Points in head-to-head matches among tied teams; Goal difference in head-to-head matches among tied teams; Goals scored in head-to-head matches among tied teams; If more than two teams are tied, and after applying all head-to-head criteria above, a subset of teams are still tied, all head-to-head criteria above are reapplied exclusively to this subset of teams; Goal difference in all group matches; Goals scored in all group matches; Penalty shoot-out if only two teams have the same number of points, and they met in the last round of the group and are tied after applying all criteria above (not used if more than two teams have the same number of points, or if their rankings are not relevant for qualification for the next stage); Disciplinary points (red card = 3 points, yellow card = 1 point, expulsion for two yellow cards in one match = 3 points); UEFA coefficient; In the main and the elite round, teams are ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss), and if tied on points, the following tiebreaking criteria are applied, in the order given, to determine the rankings (Regulations Articles 15.01 and 15.02): Points in head-to-head matches among tied teams; Goal difference in head-to-head matches among tied teams; Goals scored in head-to-head matches among tied teams; If more than two teams are tied, and after applying all head-to-head criteria above, a subset of teams are still tied, all head-to-head criteria above are reapplied exclusively to this subset of teams; Goal difference in all group matches; Goals scored in all group matches; Penalty shoot-out if only two teams have the same number of points, and they met in the last round of the group and are tied after applying all criteria above (not used if more than two teams have the same number of points, or if their rankings are not relevant for qualification for the next stage); Away goals scored in all group matches; Wins in all group matches; Away wins in all group matches; Disciplinary points (red card = 3 points, yellow card = 1 point, expulsion for two yellow cards in one match = 3 points); UEFA coefficient used for the group phase draw; In the play-offs, the team that scores more goals on aggregate over the two legs qualifies for the final tournament. As there is no away goals rule , if the aggregate score is level, an extra time of two 5-minute periods is played. If both teams score the same number of goals or no goals are scored during extra time, the tie is decided by penalty shoot-out (Regulations Article 16.01). Teams The 48 teams were seeded according to the coefficient ranking. Seeded teams were determined based in November 2021 UEFA coefficient (shown in brackets). Six teams were pre-selected as hosts for the preliminary round. The draw for the preliminary round was held on 7 December 2021. Notes NR \u2013 No rank (Team has been inactive on the previous 36 months) Schedule The qualifying matches are played on dates that fall within the FIFA Futsal International Match Calendar.

However, after FIFA threatened with disciplinary actions, the Lithuanian Federation requested UEFA their home match against Belarus to be played at a neutral venue. The decision means that both home and away matches will be played in Armenia. ^ a b c d Due to the country's involvement in the Russian invasion of Ukraine , Belarusian teams were required to play their home matches at neutral venues and behind closed doors until further notice.

{"id": "doc_random_104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redford_Theatre", "text": "The Redford Theatre is an atmospheric theatre in the Old Redford neighborhood of Detroit . The theatre opened in January 1928, advertised as \"Detroit's most unique suburban theatre,\" due to its grand design, featuring Japanese and Chinese motifs. The Redford is part of a series of three grand cinemas in the Detroit suburbs operated by the Kunsky circuit, all of which stand today. The Redford features its original 3- manual /10-rank Barton organ , which is played regularly. The Redford's ownership passed to the Goldberg family and their Community Theatre chain in the 1930s. The Motor City Theatre Organ Society purchased the theatre in 1977, and continues to operate and renovate the space, presenting organ shows and classic movies. The theatre was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. History Interior of the auditorium, showing the starry sky and the Japanese theme The Redford was built during a short-lived period of rapid expansion of the City of Detroit, its namesake neighborhood having been annexed into the city in 1926 from Redford Township . The annexation was accompanied by promises of further development and increased access to city services, and the construction of the Redford Theatre became a key part of that development. The theatre's construction was financed by bonds sold by Backus, Fordson, and Company in the amount of $225,000, equivalent to $3,260,000 in 2024. The opening of the theatre was the culmination of a weeklong festival, sponsored by local businesses. At its opening, the Redford was advertised as \"Detroit's most unique suburban theatre,\" likening the experience of seeing a show there to \"sitting in a Japanese garden.\" The theatre's interior also featured standard components of an atmospheric theatre, including a blue plaster ceiling evoking clouds and twinkling stars. The interior theme of the theatre extended to its 3- manual /10-rank Barton theatre organ , which was installed with Japanese and Chinese-themed instruments. During World War II, many of the original Japanese-style decorations, including the lobby chandeliers, were covered up or removed as part of a broader trend of anti-Japanese sentiment . Organ performances ended around the same time, although the organ remained intact. The original marquee was scrapped for the war effort. In 1966, the Motor City Theatre Organ Society, a local chapter of the American Theatre Organ Society , began a series of organ performances at the theatre. The MTCOS had begun to restore the organ the year prior, and initially performed their organ shows after the last film showing of the evening. The organ shows were successful, showing a continued desire for programming at the Redford. The MCTOS arranged to buy the theatre in 1977, and owned it outright by 1985, the same year as it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places . Work began that year to restore the Redford to its original 1928 appearance. The theatre currently seats 1610, lower than the original capacity of over 2000. The Redford continues to be operated by the all-volunteer staff of the MTCOS, and is committed to keeping prices for admission and concessions low. The theatre derives its revenue from admission, concession sales, and the rental of the venue for private events, including weddings. Organ The organ console, with the lift in the lowered position The Redford Theatre features a 3- manual /10-rank theatre organ , built by the Bartola Musical Instrument Company . The \"Golden-Voiced Barton\" has been altered only slightly from its original state, with the addition of a piano and modifications to the tuba. The organ is played regularly at public events, including overtures before classic films, accompaniment for silent films , and full-length organ concerts. The Redford's organ is one of two theatre organs in Detroit that remain in their original venue, and one of fewer than forty Bartons in their original installations. A contemporaneous original-installation Barton organ is located nearby at the Michigan Theater in Ann Arbor . The Redford's sibling theatres, the Kunsky-Birmingham (now an Emagine multiplex ) and the Kunsky-Royal Oak (now the Royal Oak Music Theatre ), featured similar Barton organs, but neither remain in their original venues. It has been digitally sampled and available for free for softwares like GrandOrgue and Hauptwerk . Programming Because of its location on the outskirts of Detroit, the spacious Redford often has not been a first-run movie theatre. However, like many current second-run theatres, it has shown films that were market-tested at other movie houses. For example, on May 16, 1956, the Redford presented two prominent 1955 films - The Rose Tattoo and The Trouble with Harry . When most of the movie theaters in the Detroit area were in the city of Detroit, the Redford Theatre screened many films that were first shown at one of the large theaters in the Grand Circus Park area of downtown Detroit. Cimarron opened at the Redford on April 19, 1931, after its Detroit premiere at the Fox Theatre on February 5, 1931. In 1956, The Searchers opened at the Palms on May 18 and arrived at the Redford on August 15. In the early 1930s, the Redford often showed three movies in one week (usually starting on Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays). During one week in 1931, patrons enjoyed Joan Crawford and Clark Gable in Laughing Sinners (July 12\u201314), Lew Ayres in Iron Man (July 15\u201316) and Spencer Tracy in Six Cylinder Love (July 17\u201318). Accompanying Redford films of the 1930s were comedy shorts ( Laurel and Hardy , Charley Chase and Our Gang ), cartoons ( Mickey Mouse , Bugs Bunny and Mighty Mouse ), golf instructional films with Bobby Jones and vaudeville acts. In the 1950s, the Redford often showed double features, along with \"Kiddie Matinees\" on Saturday afternoons that included cartoons and special movies. Occasionally, the Redford hosted Detroit area premieres, such as the December 25, 1956 opening of Friendly Persuasion , which was crowded out of the larger theaters by blockbusters like The Ten Commandments . When movies started opening outside of downtown Detroit in the 1960s, the Redford was a first run theater for many prominent movies, including One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961), Hud (1963), Von Ryan's Express (1965), You Only Live Twice (1967), Cool Hand Luke (1967), and The Graduate (1967). In the 1970s, when socioeconomic forces closed many Detroit theaters and opened many others in the Detroit suburbs, the Redford went into decline and later was reborn with a still-running series of classic Hollywood movies. The Redford is one of the few remaining theaters mentioned in a September 11, 1981 Detroit News article about film repertory houses in the Detroit area. Current film programming at the Redford Theatre consists of a bi-weekly movie series that ranges from silent films through the musicals of the 40s, 50s and 60s to some films from the 2000s. Spring and Fall festivals featuring films of the Three Stooges have grown in popularity. In addition to the classic film series and organ concerts produced by MCTOS, the theatre is available for rental by community groups wishing to produce their own shows.

{"id": "doc_random_105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchard_Supply_Hardware", "text": "Orchard Supply Hardware ( OSH ) was an American retailer of home improvement and gardening products. Headquartered in San Jose , California , Orchard Supply Hardware had dozens of locations throughout California, with expansions into Oregon and Florida . After starting as a non-profit cooperative in 1931, the company later turned into a for-profit corporation before it was bought and sold by a number of different corporations during the 1980s. In 1996, the company was acquired by Sears . After a brief period as a public company in 2012\u201313, the company filed for a Chapter 11 reorganization . In 2013, the bulk of OSH's assets and locations were purchased by the home improvement store chain, Lowe's . For the next five years, the chain was operated as a subsidiary of Lowe's and used for strategic expansion of retail operations. All stores were closed in November 2018. In January 2020, the Memphis-based Central Network Retail Group purchased the OSH brand from Lowe's. History Co-op member certificate from 1942 signed by founder Stanley B. Smith Original neon sign for Orchard Supply Hardware, store #3, at 720 W San Carlos Street, San Jose, CA, as shown in 2013 Orchard Supply was formed in 1931 as the Orchard Supply Farmers Co-op by 30 farmers, consisting mostly of orchardists and fruit tree ranchers who banded together to form a cooperative to buy essential farm supplies. Each farmer put up $30 and in the midst of the Great Depression a new company was formed. Stanley B. Smith served as the company's first general manager and president. Operations started in a rented warehouse at 230 Bassett Street in San Jose, California . In spite of the Great Depression , the cooperative was successful. In 1933 the co-op had moved to a larger location at 44 Vine Street in San Jose. The new location featured a large retail display area, off-street parking, and an adjoining warehouse. In 1946, the company moved to a site at 720 West San Carlos Street in San Jose. By then, there were almost 2,000 members. In 1962, Albert B. Smith (Stanley's son) became president, expanding the business into a chain of stores which, at 25,000 square feet (2,300\u00a0m 2 ) each, were considered large at the time. By 1950, the electronics industry began booming in the Santa Clara Valley , and with it came an abundance of new home owners in the San Francisco Bay Area . The orchards gradually became residential neighborhoods, and the \"Orchard Supply Farmers Co-op\" became a for-profit corporation, \"Orchard Supply Hardware\" retail stores. In 1977, the company purchased a 19-acre warehouse and office complex from Sunsweet Growers to serve as a distribution center . In the 1980s, Loren S. Smith (another son of Stanley) became president and continued the expansion. In 1992 the distribution center was moved to Tracy, California . Interior of an Orchard Supply Hardware store in San Rafael, California as shown in 2016 Corporate acquisitions Orchard Supply Hardware ceased to be a privately owned company when it and its seven stores were acquired by the conglomerate W.R. Grace and Company in 1979. W.R. Grace began to sell off its 660-store retail division piecemeal in 1985. OSH and another hardware chain, Home Centers West, were sold to Wickes Companies in May 1986. Wickes had already owned the Builders Emporium hardware chain. It was restructuring after emerging from bankruptcy under the leadership of turnaround specialist Sanford Sigoloff . Under Wickes ownership, OSH grew to 31 stores in California, and was spun out again April 1989. The $134 million management buyout was led by OSH president Maynard Jenkins and Freeman Spogli & Company . In March 1993, OSH made an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ORH. In the same year, OSH expanded into Southern California by acquiring several hardware stores from the Builders Emporium chain when the former sibling chain went out of business. OSH was purchased by Sears in 1996 after seven years of independence. By the end of 2000, OSH had grown to 274 stores. In 2005, Sears sold a 19.9% interest in the company to Ares Management of Los Angeles for US$58.7 million, announcing expansion plans at the time. Ares had the option to later purchase another 30.2% stake in the company for US$126.8 million, but did not exercise this right. OSH had eighty-four stores at the time. At roughly the same time, Sears Holdings announced that its Sears, Roebuck & Co. subsidiary expected to receive a dividend from OSH of about US$450 million. In connection with the initial investment, OSH was expected to issue US$405 million in debt. This debt was later cited as one of the primary reasons for its 2013 Chapter 11 filing. Mark Baker took over leadership of OSH as President and CEO in March 2011. Mr. Baker was a veteran of the major hardware chains HomeBase , Home Depot , Scotty's , as well as Gander Mountain and Scotts Miracle-Gro companies. OSH was spun out of Sears Holdings in 2012 and became a public company . In January 2012 shares began trading on the Nasdaq stock market under the symbol OSH. Expansion In April 2013, OSH expanded beyond California, opening stores in the suburban Portland metropolitan area of Oregon . Bankruptcy and Lowe's acquisition On June 17, 2013, Orchard Supply Hardware announced it filed for Chapter 11 under the U.S. bankruptcy code and that most of its assets would be sold to the Lowe's Home Improvement chain for $205M in cash. Lowe's agreed to acquire no fewer than sixty of the (at the time) ninety-one Orchard Supply stores, operating them separately from Lowe's. At the close of the process, Orchard Supply remained a separate brand and operating entity from the Lowe's chain. In August 2013, preparations were made to close seventeen of the ninety-nine stores. Two of the stores were closed in June as a part of normal operations. This left seventy of the pre-Chapter 11 announcement stores still in operation. According to a company spokesperson, workers at the stores that closed were not eligible for severance pay due to the bankruptcy proceeding, but Orchard Supply is \"providing incentive bonuses to key employees.\" Lowe's also committed to investing US$200 million in OSH over the next five years. In November 2014, the company opened its first location in the city of San Francisco . The North Beach store located at 2598 Taylor Street was a former Petco and had a planned June 2015 opening. The store represented a new strategy for Lowe's to enter urban regions and markets using the OSH brand. This was following the opening of a store in the population dense Mid-Wilshire district of Los Angeles. In 2016, Lowe's announced the expansion of the Orchard brand to South Florida. Lowe's robotics Via a technology program launched initially by Lowe's in 2014, OSH announced a pilot program using \"robot employees\" at their San Jose store at 377 Royal Avenue. The devices, called OSHbots , were supplied by a Mountain View, California , company called Fellow Robots. The OSHbots resembled white columns with two large LCD screens and were equipped with 3D cameras, so they could identify items brought in by customers, and had wheels on either side that helped them move. Customers could research items on the screens and then the robot could lead them to the aisle where an item was located. The robots spoke English and Spanish and were connected to an inventory database so they could inform customers if an item was out of stock. Post-Lowes On August 22, 2018, Lowe's publicly announced that Orchard Supply Hardware would be closed down nationwide, and would begin liquidation . It said stores would be closed by the following February, and all had been closed by November. Outdoor Supply Hardware In 2019, Central Network Retail Group (CNRG) purchased leases to 7 former OSH locations in the San Francisco Bay Area . New hardware stores in these locations were branded \"Outdoor Supply Hardware\", and kept a similar appearance and experience as the old OSH stores. CNRG bought the full \"Orchard Supply Hardware\" trademark in January 2020. Marketing Boxcar Orchard Supply Hardware boxcar (OSHX 1) at History Park at Kelley Park In the early 1960s, the city of San Jose denied Al Smith permission to install a sign along Auzerais Street to promote his Orchard Supply Hardware store because a sign for the store already existed facing San Carlos Street. Undeterred, Smith bought a railroad boxcar from Southern Pacific, painted the car with the OSH logo, and placed it at the end of the spur track behind his store and alongside Auzerais Street. It remained in that spot for nearly 50 years, and was occasionally featured in OSH's promotional material. Recognizing its historic relationship to the San Jose community, OSH donated the boxcar to the California Trolley and Railroad Corporation in 2013 for display in History Park at Kelley Park . Calendars Originally conceived as a marketing program, company president, Al Smith who had worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad , had a love of trains and is credited with the theme. One aspect that initially made these calendars unique was that all original paintings were commissioned as artwork for each month. The theme of these calendars has primarily been trains and railroad history , with only a few diversions, including the 1981 calendar which celebrated the Santa Clara Valley . Other images have featured landscapes, steam-powered machines, automobiles, historical drawings, produce from the Santa Clara Valley . From 1975 until 1992, railroad artist and local politician Michael Kotowski created each painting with the exception of the 1977 and 1979 calendars. The 1977 edition was a selection of \u201cStill Live\u201d paintings by the Santa Cruz Art League and the 1979 edition was a series of Southwestern style paintings by Northern California artist Anthony Quartuccio, Sr . The 1982 calendar had a flight and aviation theme called \u201cUp, Up and Away\u201d for which Kotowski created the original artwork even though it was not train related. Kotowski did the layout design and production on the entire series under his tenure as artist. OSH's calendars have featured the works of twenty-three different artists who have created over 450 unique pieces including railroad artists such as Kotowski, John Winfield, James R Mann, 2017 Calendar, and Ken Muramoto; Muramoto has the distinction of being the youngest artist to provide paintings for the calendar.

{"id": "doc_random_108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale-class_tanker", "text": "For the Dale class oilers of the Second World War, see Dale-class oiler . The Dale class consisted of three tankers chartered for service with the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), the naval auxiliary fleet of the United Kingdom . In 1967. They served for a number of years supporting Royal Navy and allied fleet operations, during which one, Ennerdale , was lost. The remaining two were returned to their original owners in the mid-1970s. Overview Three large modern tankers, built to varying designs in the mid-1960s, were charted by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary to support naval operations east of the Suez Canal , in the waters of the Indian Ocean and the Far East . They were given traditional RFA names , reusing three names that had been used for the Second World War -era Dale-class oilers . They were not fitted with equipment to allow them to replenish ships at sea, and were classified instead as 'Mobile Reserve Tankers'. The smallest, RFA Ennerdale was also the shortest lived. She hit a coral reef and sank off Port Victoria on 1 June 1970. The wreck was subsequently destroyed with explosives fired from Wessex helicopters to prevent an oil spillage from threatening the Seychelles . RFA\u00a0 Derwentdale was returned to her original owners in 1974, but RFA\u00a0 Dewdale remained in service until 1977. During this time Dewdale saw service with the Aden task force during the British withdrawal in 1967, and was then active then on the Beira Patrols . She was the last to leave service with the RFA, being returned in 1977 and commencing service under her old name of Edenfield . Background In July 1967, the MOD announced that it had bareboat chartered, for a period of seven years, three large tankers for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. These vessels were the largest in the RFA fleet at the time. Comparison Ships Derwentdale Main article: RFA Derwentdale (A221) Derwentdale was launched as Halcyon Breeze by Hitachi Zosen Corporation at its Innoshima, Hiroshima shipyard on 18 January 1964, for Caribbean Tankers Ltd, managed by Court Line(Ship Management) Ltd, London. She began her RFA charter on 17 June 1967. Dewdale Main article: RFA Dewdale (A129) Dewdale was launched as Edenfield for Hunting (Eden) Tankers Ltd, managed by Hunting & Son Ltd, by Harland & Wolff on 5 March 1965 and began her charter on 14 August 1967.

{"id": "doc_random_109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zawiya_of_Sidi_Muhammad_Ben_Sliman_al-Jazuli", "text": "The Zawiya of Sidi Muhammad Ben Sliman al-Jazuli is a zawiya (Islamic Sufi religious complex) in Marrakesh , Morocco. It is centered around the tomb of Muhammad al-Jazuli , a 15th-century Muslim scholar and Sufi saint who is one of the Seven Saints of Marrakesh . The complex was established around 1523\u20134, when the Saadian ruler Ahmad al-'Araj transferred al-Jazuli's body here. It was subsequently restored and modified in later periods. The complex consists mainly of a mosque and a mausoleum chamber, with other smaller elements including an ablutions facility, a street fountain, a hospice, a residence, and a school room. A small cemetery next to the complex contains the tombs of Ahmad al-'Araj and other members of his family. Historical background Al-Jazuli was a major figure in the history of Moroccan Sufism . He lived at a time when local Sufi movements were also filling a void of political leadership against the encroachment of Portuguese and Spanish forces into the country. Originating from the Sous region in southern Morocco, he spent much time in Fes where he wrote his most famous work, the Dala'il al-Khayrat , and gained enormous influence over zawiyas and followers across the country. He subsequently moved around the coast of Morocco until he died near Essaouira in 1465 and was buried in the village of Afoughal. Later on, the early Saadians , who were also from the Sous region, associated themselves with al-Jazuli's followers as they established their own political power in southern Morocco. Thus, when Ahmad al-'Araj (the effective founder of the Saadian dynasty) moved to Marrakesh in 1521 he quickly arranged for the transfer of al-Jazuli's body here, probably in 1523\u20134, along with that of his own father (who had been buried near al-Jazuli in 1517). The Saadians built a religious complex and mosque around the new mausoleum. After the reign of Muhammad al-Sheikh (Ahmad's brother, who had managed to dethrone him), the dynasty distanced itself from al-Jazuli's disciples. Nonetheless, al-Jazuli came to be considered one of the Seven Saints of Marrakesh and his tomb was a prominent stop for pilgrims to the city. While the mosque of the complex may still date from the Saadian period, the rest of the zawiya was frequently modified and restored over the years, particularly in the 18th century. The Alaouite sultan Moulay Isma'il was responsible for building the current mausoleum chamber with its large pyramidal cupola as well as for expanding the attached mosque and converting it to a Friday mosque . The street fountain of the complex also dates from this period. The zawiya was significantly restored or modified under Moulay Muhammad ibn Abdallah (who was made governor of Marrakesh in 1746 and ruled as sultan from 1757 to 1790) and was repaired in 1867-68 under Moulay Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman . Architecture and layout One of the main entrances (left) of the zawiya and, next to it (right), the zawiya's street fountain. The decoration includes carved stucco , a carved wooden canopy, and zellij tilework. The mosque and mausoleum complex The zawiya is a complex of structures and facilities which provide for a number of services and functions. Their architecture is similar to that of other Saadian religious complexes in the late 16th century such as the Mouassine Mosque and Bab Doukkala Mosque , as well as the later Zawiya of Sidi Bel Abbes . The center of the complex is occupied by a mosque with a rectangular floor plan consisting of a nearly square courtyard ( sahn ) and an interior prayer hall divided into five naves by rows of arches. The interior of the mosque is not heavily decorated. North of the sahn is another courtyard which leads to the mausoleum chamber of al-Jazuli: a large square chamber higher than the surrounding structures and covered by a wood-frame cupola and, from the exterior, a pyramidal roof with green tiles, visible from the street and typical of Moroccan royal and religious structures. Immediately on the east side of the mausoleum are two of the zawiya's main entrances, alongside a decorated street fountain . Behind these is a small chamber which served as a madrasa or school. The rest of the complex, on its eastern side, is occupied by the house of the muqaddam , a hospice for pilgrims, and a large midha ( ablutions house) with a central water basin and 14 latrines. The cemetery and the Saadian mausoleum The establishment of the zawiya also led to the development of a small cemetery along its western flank (separate from al-Jazuli's actual mausoleum chamber) which also served as the very first burial site of the Saadian dynasty in Marrakesh (before the later Saadian Tombs in the Kasbah ). Soon after Muhammad al-Sheikh was assassinated by the Ottomans in 1557, Ahmad al-'Araj (his brother) was put to death, along with all his possible male heirs, allowing Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib to accede to power unchallenged. After a time, Ahmad and his sons were buried near al-Jazuli's mausoleum on the initiative of the local scholar Abu 'Amru al-Qastali al-Murrakshi. According to his tombstone's inscription, his daughter 'Aysha was responsible for erecting the domed mausoleum, known as the Qub\u016br al-Ashraf , over his tomb. His tombstone, carved in black marble , disappeared sometime after 1946. Another tombstone within the mausoleum is believed to be for Ahmad's father, Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Rahman (also known as al-Qa'im bi-'Amrillah), though this is not confirmed by any inscription. The mausoleum structure is a simple chamber made in brick with a dome on an octagonal base. Inside, the upper walls of the chamber are decorated with arabesque and epigraphic motifs carved in plaster . See also Zawiya of Sidi Abd el-Aziz Notes ^ Also rendered as Zaouia of Sidi Ben Slimane al-Jazouli . ^ Historian Gaston Deverdun notes that, depending on which numbers in the historical sources are used to calculate this date, the transfer could have occurred in a range of years after this. He concludes that the date indicated by the historical author al-Ifrani,1523\u20134, is the most likely. References ^ a b c d e f g h Deverdun, Gaston (1959).

{"id": "doc_random_111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Nishapur_(1221)", "text": "The siege of Nishapur (Persian: \u0645\u062d\u0627\u0635\u0631\u0647 \u0646\u06cc\u0634\u0627\u067e\u0648\u0631 ) took place in April 1221 (Muharram 618 AH), during the Mongol invasion of Khorasan . The siege was led by Tolui Khan , son of Genghis Khan , following the death of Genghis Khan's son-in-law Taghaqchar during an earlier engagement at Nishapur. The fall of the city resulted in a large-scale massacre and the near-total destruction of Nishapur. The city of Nishapur was a major center of learning, trade, and culture in Khorasan . Located on the Silk Road , it thrived as a regional capital known for its bustling markets, pottery, and production of textiles and turquoise. Then it became part of the Khwarazmian Empire. In the spring of 1221 a Mongol force, estimated to number between 10,000 and 15,000 men and led by Tolui , son of Genghis Khan , besieged the city and after breaching its defences, the entire population was put to the sword and the city laid waste as an act of vengeance. According to the Persian chronicler Ata-Malik Juvayni , the settlement was so thoroughly destroyed that not even cats and dogs were spared, and its site was sown with barley. Historical accounts state that Nishapurs population was massacred following its capture by the Mongols in 1221. Medieval sources, including Ata-Malik Juvayni , report death tolls exceeding 1,747,000 people, while some modern scholars call these exaggerations and estimate casualties between 100,000 and 200,000. Background Main article: Nishapur Nishapur was located on a plain surrounded by mountains and had both surface and underground channels (qanat) that supplied water to the city and nearby farms. It had a citadel (kuhandiz or qohandez), an intramural city (shahrist\u00e1n or \u0161ahrest\u0101n), and extramural suburbs (rabad or rabaz), in addition to an Aljama mosque, a government palace, and markets. The citadel stood on an artificial platform, constructed by the Samanids, a dynasty that carried out similar works in Bukhara and Samarkand . Nishapur was a major Iranian city located in Khorasan and was a major crossroads on the Silk Road . It served as the capital of several dynasties throughout its history and became one of eastern Iran\u2019s principal urban centres. Under the Samanids , Nishapur became a provincial capital and hub of trade and culture. During the Seljuk period, the city rose to even greater prominence, often serving as a royal residence. In its prosperous eras, the city was noted for vibrant trade (silk, cotton textiles, turquoise ), skilled artisans, and intellectual activity. During the 11th to 13th centuries, shortly before the Mongol conquest, Nishapur was one of the largest and most prosperous cities in the region, with a population estimated between 100,000 and 200,000. Prelude See also: Mongol invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire and Mongol invasion of Khorasan Campaigns of Genghis Khan between 1207 and 1225 Swedish scholar Carl Fredrick Sverdrup interprets that the Mongol generals Jebe , Subutai and Taghachar were sent to pursue the fleeing Shah Mohammed II of Khwarazm in 1220, but after crossing the Amu Daria, Taghaqchar stayed behind in Balkh . In May 1220 Jebe and Subutai arrived in Nishapur demanding provisions, which were delivered quickly, before they continued towards Tus to pursue the Shah. They left Nishapur on June, but in the following months, false rumors of Mongolian defeats led their city's inhabitants to rebel. The khagan then sent Taghaqchar to pacify Khorasan. He attacked enemy positions near Herat. This attack may have been a breach of the agreement between Nishapur\u2019s inhabitants and Jebe and Subutai, although Taghaqchar did not attack the city directly. Following the fall of Urgench in early 1221, Genghis Khan split his forces to subdue the regions actively rebelling against the Mongols throughout Persia and Central Asia. hearing about the successes of the Khwarazmian prince Jalal al-Din Mangburni , Genghis Khan instructed his fourth son, Tolui , to lead an army of 80,000 men to Khorasan, with the mission of destroying the remaining Khwarazmian strongholds, including Merv , Nishapur , and Herat . Nishapur 's governor, Sharaf al-Din Amir Majlis, resolved to resist the Mongol advance, supported by local militias and a force of 12,000 archers stationed at each of the four city gates, totaling 48,000. Siege Envoys of Genghis Khan at the gates of Nishapur, 15th-century Persian miniature Tolui's army reached Nishapur in \u1e62afar 618 AH (March\u2013April 1221 CE). The Mongols surrounded the city and began bombardment using a large arsenal that, according to Persian chroniclers, included 3,000 siege crossbows, 100 mangonels and ballistae, 1,000 scaffolds, 4,000 scaling ladders, and 1,700 naphtha-throwers. Although the accuracy of these figures is uncertain, they illustrate the scale and sophistication of the Mongol siege machinery, influenced by Chinese technology . For eight days, the defenders roughly 12,000 archers repelled several attacks. They saw no hope of salvation except in sending the city\u2019s chief qadi, Mawl\u0101n\u0101 Rukn al-D\u012bn \u02bfAl\u012b ibn Ibr\u0101h\u012bm al-Mugh\u012bs\u012b (al-Margh\u012bs\u012b), to Tolui. Upon reaching him, he pleaded for quarter on behalf of the people of Nishapur and agreed to pay tribute in an attempt to secure their safety. His efforts however were unsuccessful, and he himself was not permitted to return. The Mongols launched a concentrated attack the next day, breaking through the walls in over 70 locations. Assault troops climbed the battlements using ladders, and Tolui\u2019s forces poured into the city, engaging in brutal street fighting. The collapse of organized resistance was caused by the combat death of Governor Sharaf al-Din. Taghachars wife allegedly led 10,000 cavalry to punish Nishapur following her husband\u2019s death. The story may be a narrative motif, and the city\u2019s inhabitants are described as having suffered extremely, \u201cquaffing from the goblet of martyrdom.\u201d It is estimated that potentially up to 1,747,000 people were slaughtered. Historical accounts describe the Mongol forces as having stacked the severed heads of men, women, and children separately into three large pyramids as a calculated act meant to instill terror and intimidation. Notable casualties Mausoleum of Attar of Nishapur in Nishapur Miniature painting by Kam\u0101l ud-D\u012bn Behz\u0101d illustrating the funeral of Attar of Nishapur The distinguished Persian poet, Sufi mystic, and hagiographer Attar of Nishapur was one of those slain during the Mongol massacre. Attar, who is regarded as one of the most important figures in classical Persian literature, was allegedly killed by a Mongol soldier when the city was being sacked when he was about seventy-eight years old. Both Persian chronicles and contemporary scholarship have cited his death during the fall of Nishapur as a major cultural loss, signifying the annihilation of the city's literary and intellectual legacy in addition to its populace. Aftermath After the fall of Nishapur in 1221 by the Mongols, the structures of the city were weakened and the agricultural output of the city was reduced. Following the capture of the city, Tolui decided to advance toward Herat , but before departing, he appointed an emir with a detachment of four hundred Taziks, ordering them to scour the ruins of Nishapur and execute any inhabitants who had survived the initial massacre, thereby ensuring that no resistance or population would remain. Mahmud Ghazan and Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan tried to make the city flourish again and the city's population grew once more and some of the villages around the city were improved and rebuilt. Hamdallah Mustawfi had visited the city of Nishapur in the Year 1339 or 1340. During this era, the ambassador of Henry III of Castile , Ruy Gonz\u00e1lez de Clavijo reached Nishapur and according to him, Nishapur had become a highly productive agricultural center with 40 non-stop working mills along the \"Abe Bostan\" (Mir Ab River of Nishapur). After the massacre, a much smaller settlement was established just north of the ancient town, and the once bustling metropolis lay underground\u2014until a team of excavators from the Metropolitan Museum of Art arrived in the mid-20th century. They worked at Nishapur between 1935 and 1940, returning for a final season in the winter of 1947\u201348. What remains of old Nishapur is a 3500-hectare \"Kohandejh ( Persian : \u06a9\u0647\u0646 \u062f\u0698)\" area, south of the current city of Nishapur.

He is prominent for his research on democratization . In his seminal 1970 article 'Transitions to Democracy: Toward a Dynamic Model,' Rustow broke from the prevailing schools of thought on how countries became democratic. Disagreeing with the heavy focus on necessary social and economic pre-conditions for democracy, he argued that national unity was the necessary precondition for democracy. Life and career Rustow was born in 1924 in Berlin . From 1933 until 1938, he was a student at the Odenwaldschule in Heppenheim , Germany. He then moved to Istanbul / Turkey , where his father Alexander R\u00fcstow had fled in 1933. He graduated from Queens College and received a PhD in political science in 1951 from Yale . He taught for one year at Oglethorpe College outside Atlanta, then at Princeton and Columbia , and finally at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York (CUNY) for 25 years. He retired in June 1995 as distinguished professor of political science and sociology . He was a visiting professor at Harvard and other institutions, a vice president of the Middle East Studies Association of North America and the recipient of a Guggenheim fellowship . He died in the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan in August 1996. The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma . He was 71 and lived on the Upper West Side. His marriages to Rachel Aubrey Rustow, a daughter of Adolph Lowe , and Tamar Gottlieb Rustow ended in divorce. In addition to his son Timothy of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife of 18 years, Dr. Margrit Wreschner, a psychoanalyst; another son, Stephen of Manhattan; two daughters, Janet of Cambridge, Mass., and Marina of Manhattan; three grandchildren; two sisters, Maria Funk, and Friedburg Lorenz (died in 2007); a half-brother, Helmut \u2013 all of them of Heppenheim , Germany; and his stepmother, Lorena (died in 1999) of Heidelberg , Germany. Major contributions Dankwart Rustow argued that the modernizationists, such as Seymour Lipset , asked a functional question: what can enhance or preserve the health of a democracy ? Rustow thought the question of transition from authoritarianism was a much more interesting one: how does a democracy come into being in the first place? Using Turkey and Sweden as his case studies, he sketched a general route through which countries travel during democratization. This had four phases: National unity : The formation of an uncontested sense of nationhood (among the \"vast majority of citizens\") was a necessary precondition. Before people could decide how to rule, there must be clarity on who 'the people' are. A prolonged and inconclusive political struggle : This occurs differently in all countries, but is typically centered around the emerging power of a new social force (i.e. a manufacturing elite). Democracy is eventually born of this conflict. It is thus not a \u2018rosy love-in,\u2019 but can be violent and bloody. This struggle can be so intense as to lead to the dominance of one group and the closing of doors to democratization. When this political struggle reaches stalemate, a window of opportunity opens up for democratization. Decision phase : When the conflicting parties realise that they are at a point of stalemate in their inconclusive political struggle they decide to compromise and adopt democratic forms of rule. For Rustow, there is always a conscious decision on the part of elites to adopt democratic rules. Habituation phase : Gradually the rules of democracy become a habit. His work laid the conceptual foundations for the later work of scholars known as 'transitologists.' Studying the decline in authoritarianism in Latin America and Southern Europe in the 1970s and 1980s, scholars such as Larry Diamond , Lawrence Whitehead, and Philip Schmitter explained transitions from authoritarianism not in terms of socio-economic or structural changes, but rather in terms of consensus and pacts between elites. The impetus for change comes not from international or socio-economic changes, but from splits within a ruling regime. Rustow's model of democratization was criticized by Adam Przeworski . Michael McFaul argued that post-Cold War Russia supported Rustow's argument that national unity was a precondition for successful democratization. A 1997 special issue of Comparative Politics and the 1999 edited collection Transitions to Democracy (edited by Lisa Anderson) focused on Rustow's work.

Josephine was the second daughter of Charles, Grand Duke of Baden , and St\u00e9phanie de Beauharnais . She was the mother of the first king of Romania , Carol I . Through her younger daughter Marie , she is the ancestress of the Belgian royal family , the grand ducal family of Luxembourg as well as the last Queen of Italy and her descendants. Through her son, Leopold , she is also ancestress of the Romanian royal family and the Serbian and Yugoslav Royal House . Life Undated portrait On 21 October 1834 at Karlsruhe , she married Karl Anton Joachim Zephyrinus Friedrich Meinrad, Prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen , son of Charles, Prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (1785\u20131853) and Princess Marie Antoinette Murat (1793\u20131847). They had six children: Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern (22 September 1835 \u2013 8 June 1905) he married Infanta Ant\u00f3nia of Portugal on 12 September 1861. They had three sons, including Ferdinand I of Romania . Princess Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (15 July 1837 \u2013 17 July 1859) she married King Pedro V of Portugal on 18 May 1858, without issue. Carol I of Romania (27 April 1839 \u2013 10 October 1914) he married Princess Elisabeth of Wied on 15 November 1869. They had one daughter . Prince Anton of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (7 October 1841 \u2013 6 August 1866) killed in the Austro-Prussian War at the age of 24. Prince Frederick of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (25 June 1843 \u2013 2 December 1904) he married Princess Louise of Thurn and Taxis on 21 June 1879, without issue. Princess Marie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (17 November 1845 \u2013 26 November 1912) she married Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders on 25 April 1867. They had five children, including Albert I of Belgium . She died at Sigmaringen on 19 June 1900. The Austrian court ordered a 12-day mourning for her death, during which members of the Habsburg dynasty were barred from participating in any festivities. This ensured that most members of the Habsburg imperial family were prevented from attending the wedding of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria to Countess Sophie Chotek on 1 July. Legacy Marie of Romania , wife of her grandson Ferdinand I , described Princess Josephine in her memoirs: \"Quite the most fascinating member of the family, besides F\u00fcrst Leopold, was his charming old mother, born a Princess of Baden. Small and frail, she had exquisite features framed in veils and laces which heightened their delicacy. Her gowns and cloaks were just as they should be... she always wore gloves much too long on the fingers, which she had not the strength to pull on properly. Being stone-deaf she had expressive little gestures indicating when she had understood your pantomimic conversation; she liked a good joke and had a sweet way of lifting her hand and covering her mouth when amused or pleasantly shocked. Dear old Grandmamma Josephine had the most lovely nose I have ever seen; it was one of God's perfections.\" Honours Dame of the Order of Louise .

For the former colony of Scotland, see Darien scheme . New Caledonia is a French territory comprising a group of islands in the southwest Pacific Ocean , 220\u00a0km (140\u00a0mi) southwest of Vanuatu and 1,210\u00a0km (750\u00a0mi) east of Australia . Located 16,100\u00a0km (10,000\u00a0mi) from Metropolitan France , it forms a sui generis collectivity of the French Republic , a legal status unique in overseas France , enshrined in a dedicated chapter of the French Constitution and with an on-going project to a status of State of New Caledonia . The archipelago , part of the Melanesia subregion, includes the main island of Grande Terre , the Loyalty Islands , the Chesterfield Islands , the Belep archipelago, the Isle of Pines , and a few remote islets. The Chesterfield Islands are in the Coral Sea . French people, especially locals, call Grande Terre le Caillou , a nickname also used more generally for the entire New Caledonia. Pro-independence Kanak parties use the name (la) Kanaky ( pron. [(la) kanaki] ) to refer to New Caledonia, a term coined in the 1980s from the ethnic name of the indigenous Melanesian Kanak people who make up 41% of New Caledonia's population. New Caledonia is associated with the European Union as an overseas country and territory (OCT) . New Caledonia has a land area of 18,575\u00a0km 2 (7,172\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) divided into three provinces . The North and South Provinces are on the New Caledonian mainland, while the Loyalty Islands Province is a series of four inhabited islands off the east coast of mainland (from north to south: Ouv\u00e9a , Lifou , Tiga , and Mar\u00e9 ). New Caledonia's population of 264,596 (April 2025 census) is of diverse origins and varies by geography; in the North and Loyalty Islands Provinces , the indigenous Kanak people predominate, while the wealthy South Province contains significant populations of European ( Caldoches and Metropolitan French ), Kanak , and Polynesian (mostly Wallisian ) origin, as well as smaller groups of Southeast Asian , Pied-Noir , and North African heritage. The capital of New Caledonia is Noum\u00e9a . History New Caledonia was part of the continent Zealandia , which broke off from the supercontinent Gondwana and sank between 79 million and 83 million years ago. The earliest traces of human presence in New Caledonia date back to the period when the Lapita culture was influential in large parts of the Pacific, c. \u20091600 \u2013500 BC or 1300\u2013200 BC. The Lapita were highly skilled navigators and agriculturists . The first settlements were concentrated around the coast and date back to the period between c. 1100 BC and AD 200. Two Kanak warriors posing with penis gourds and spears, around 1880 British explorer James Cook was one of the first Europeans to sight New Caledonia, on 4 September 1774, during his second voyage. He named it \"New Caledonia \", as the northeast of the island reminded him of Scotland . The west coast of Grande Terre was approached by the Comte de Lap\u00e9rouse in 1788, shortly before his disappearance, and the Loyalty Islands were first visited between 1793 and 1796 when Mare, Lifou, Tiga, and Ouvea were mapped by English whaler William Raven . Raven encountered the island then named Britania, and today known as Mar\u00e9 (Loyalty Is.), in November 1793. From 1796 until 1840, only a few sporadic contacts with the archipelago were recorded. About 50 American whalers left record of being in the region (Grande Terre, Loyalty Is., Walpole and Hunter) between 1793 and 1887. Contacts with visiting ships became more frequent after 1840, because of their interest in sandalwood . As trade in sandalwood declined, it was replaced by a new business enterprise, \" blackbirding \", a euphemism for taking Melanesian or Western Pacific Islanders from New Caledonia, the Loyalty Islands, New Hebrides , New Guinea , and the Solomon Islands into slavery , indentured or forced labour in the sugarcane plantations in Fiji and Queensland by various methods of trickery and deception. Blackbirding was practised by both French and Australian traders, but in New Caledonia's case, the trade in the early decades of the twentieth century involved kidnapping children from the Loyalty Islands to the Grand Terre for forced labour in plantation agriculture. New Caledonia's primary experience with blackbirding revolved around a trade from the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu ) to the Grand Terre for labour in plantation agriculture, mines, as well as guards over convicts and in some public works. In the early years of the trade, coercion was used to lure Melanesian islanders onto ships. In later years indenture systems were developed; however, when it came to the French slave trade, which took place between its Melanesian colonies of the New Hebrides and New Caledonia, very few regulations were implemented. This represented a departure from contemporary developments in Australia, since increased regulations were developed to mitigate the abuses of blackbirding and 'recruitment' strategies on the coastlines. The first missionaries from the London Missionary Society and the Marist Brothers arrived in the 1840s. In 1849, the crew of the American ship Cutter was killed and eaten by the Pouma clan. Human cannibalism was widespread throughout New Caledonia. French colonisation Further information: Communards \u00a7\u00a0Life in New Caledonia On 24 September 1853, under orders from Emperor Napoleon III , Admiral Febvrier Despointes took formal possession of New Caledonia. Captain Louis-Marie-Fran\u00e7ois Tardy de Montravel founded Port-de-France (Noum\u00e9a) on 25 June 1854. A few dozen free settlers settled on the west coast in the following years. New Caledonia became a penal colony in 1864, and from the 1860s until the end of the transportations in 1897, France sent about 22,000 criminals and political prisoners to New Caledonia. The Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des prisons for 1888 indicates that 10,428 convicts, including 2,329 freed ones, were on the island as of 1 May 1888, by far the largest number of convicts detained in French overseas penitentiaries. The convicts included many Communards , arrested after the failed Paris Commune of 1871, including Henri de Rochefort and Louise Michel . Between 1873 and 1876, 4,200 political prisoners were \"relegated\" to New Caledonia. Only 40 of them settled in the colony; the rest returned to France after being granted amnesty in 1879 and 1880. Chief\u00a0King Jacques and his Queen, from The Romance of the South Seas , Clement Lindley Wragge, Chatto & Windus, 1906 In 1864, nickel was discovered on the banks of the Diahot River ; with the establishment of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Le Nickel in 1876, mining began in earnest. To work the mines the French imported labourers from neighbouring islands and from the New Hebrides, and later from Japan , the Dutch East Indies , and French Indochina . The French government also attempted to encourage European immigration, without much success. The indigenous Kanak people were excluded from the French economy and from mining work, and ultimately confined to reservations. This sparked a violent reaction in 1878, when High Chief Ata\u00ef of La Foa managed to unite many of the central tribes and launched a guerrilla war that killed 200 Frenchmen and 1,000 Kanaks. A second uprising occurred in 1917, with Protestant missionaries like Maurice Leenhardt functioning as witnesses to the events of this war. Leenhardt would pen a number of ethnographic works on the Kanak of New Caledonia. No\u00ebl of Tiamou led the 1917 rebellion, which resulted in a number of orphaned children, one of whom was taken into the care of Protestant missionary Alphonse Rouel. This child, Wenceslas Thi, would become the father of Jean-Marie Tjibaou (1936\u20131989). Europeans brought new diseases such as smallpox and measles , which caused the deaths of many natives. The Kanak population declined from around 60,000 in 1878 to 27,100 in 1921, and their numbers did not increase again until the 1930s. World War II Further information: Pacific Islands home front during World War II \u00a7\u00a0Employment In June 1940, after the fall of France , the General Council of New Caledonia voted to reject the Vichy government and continue supporting the Allied military effort against Germany. However, the colonial governor Georges-Marc P\u00e9licier promulgated the Vichy government's Constitutional Law , which sparked street demonstrations and an assassination attempt. By this time Caldoches had been in contact with Charles de Gaulle who encouraged them to form a Free French committee and appointed Henri Sautot as governor. The Vichy government dispatched a warship, Dumont d'Urville , at P\u00e9licier's request, but soon deemed him incompetent and appointed an acting governor. By this time the Australian government had agreed to intervene and dispatched HMAS Adelaide to oversee the installation of Sautot as governor. A stand-off between Dumont d'Urville and Adelaide followed, with P\u00e9licier and other pro-Vichy officials ultimately deported to French Indochina. In 1941, some 300 men from the territory volunteered for service overseas. They were joined, in April, by 300 men from French Polynesia ('the Tahitians'), plus a handful from the French districts of the New Hebrides: together they formed the Bataillon du Pacifique . The Caledonians formed two of the companies, and the Polynesians the other two. In May 1941, they sailed to Australia and boarded the RMS\u00a0 Queen Elizabeth for the onward voyage to Africa. They joined the other Free French (FF) battalions in Qastina in August, before moving to the Western Desert with the 1st FF Brigade ( 1 re BFL ). There they were one of the four battalions who took part in the breakout after the Battle of Bir Hakeim in 1942. Their losses could not easily be replaced from the Pacific and they were therefore amalgamated with the Frenchmen of another battalion wearing the anchor of la Coloniale , the BIM, to form the Bataillon de l'infanterie de marine et du Pacifique . The combined battalion formed part of the Gaulliste 1 re Division Motoris\u00e9e d'Infanterie / Division de Marche d'Infanterie , alongside three divisions from the French North African forces, in the French Expeditionary Corps during the Italian Campaign. They landed in Provence in 1944, when they were posted out and replaced by local French volunteers and r\u00e9sistants. Meanwhile, in March 1942, with the assistance of Australia, New Caledonia became an important Allied base, and the main South Pacific Fleet base of the United States Navy in the South Pacific moved to Noum\u00e9a in 1942\u20131943. The fleet that turned back the Japanese Navy in the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942 was based at Noum\u00e9a. American troops stationed on New Caledonia numbered as many as 50,000, matching the entire local population at the time. French overseas territory In 1946, New Caledonia became an overseas territory. By 1953, French citizenship had been granted to all New Caledonians, regardless of ethnicity. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, New Caledonia strengthened its economic links with Australia, particularly as turmoil within France and its empire weakened New Caledonia's traditional economic links to metropolitan France; New Caledonia supplied nickel to Australia in exchange for coal vital for smelting nickel. New Caledonian exports of iron ore and timber to Australia also increased during this time period. The European and Polynesian populations gradually increased in the years leading to the nickel boom of 1969\u20131972, and the indigenous Kanak Melanesians became a minority, though they were still the largest ethnic group. The Events Between 1976 and 1988, a period referred to as \"the Events\" ( French : Les \u00c9v\u00e9nements ), conflicts between French government actions and the Kanak independence movement saw periods of serious violence and disorder. In 1983, a statute of \"enlarged autonomy\" for the territory proposed a five-year transition period and a referendum in 1989. In March 1984, the Front Ind\u00e9pendantiste, a Kanak resistance group, seized farms and the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS) formed a provisional government. In January 1985, the French Left-wing government offered sovereignty to the Kanaks and legal protection for European settlers. The plan faltered as violence escalated. The government declared a state of emergency; however, regional elections went ahead , and the FLNKS won control of three out of four provinces. The centre-right government elected in France in March 1986 began eroding the arrangements established under the Socialists, redistributing lands mostly without consideration of native land claims, resulting in over two-thirds going to Europeans and less than a third to the Kanaks. By the end of 1987, roadblocks, gun battles and the destruction of property culminated in the Ouv\u00e9a cave hostage taking , a dramatic hostage crisis just days before the 1988 French presidential election began. Pro-independence militants on Ouv\u00e9a killed four gendarmes and took 27 hostage. The military assaulted the cave to rescue the hostages. Nineteen Kanak hostage takers were killed and another three died in custody, while two soldiers were killed during the assault. Noum\u00e9a Accord and independence referendums Flags side by side on the same pole, Noum\u00e9a, March 2011 The Matignon Agreements , signed on 26 June 1988, ensured a decade of stability. The Noum\u00e9a Accord , signed 5 May 1998, set the groundwork for a 20-year transition that gradually transfers competences to the local government. Following the timeline set by the Noum\u00e9a Accord that stated a vote must take place by the end of 2018, the groundwork was laid for a referendum on full independence from France at a meeting chaired by the French Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe on 2 November 2017, to be held by November 2018. Voter list eligibility was the subject of a long dispute, but the details were resolved in an electoral list that granted automatic eligibility to voters of Kanak origin but excluded those of other origins who had not been longtime residents of the territory. The referendum was held on 4 November 2018 , with independence being rejected. Another referendum was held in October 2020 , with voters once again choosing to remain a part of France. In the 2018 referendum, 56.7% of voters chose to remain in France. In the 2020 referendum, this percentage dropped with 53.4% of voters choosing to remain part of France. The third referendum was held on 12 December 2021. The referendum was boycotted by pro-independence forces, who argued for a delayed vote due to the impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic ; when the French government declined to do so, they called for a boycott. This led to 96% of voters choosing to stay with France. In May 2024, riots broke out amid debate over a proposed electoral reform in the territory. In October 2024, then-French Prime Minister Michel Barnier scrapped the bill, citing the need to restore calm and telling the National Assembly that \"avoiding further unrest\" was a priority. On 2 December 2024, curfew was officially lifted as the riots were over. In July 2025, a deal was struck between the French Government and New Caledonia, to establish a new \u201c\u00c9tat de Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie\u201d, the \u201cState of New Caledonia\u201d, with the status to be enshrined in the Constitution of the French Republic . Residents of New Caledonia who have lived in New Caledonia for at least ten years will be given the right to vote, starting with the 2031 provincial elections. Such deal is to be confirmed by the French Parliament in the fourth quartile of 2025, with the deal to then be voted on by New Caledonians in 2026 as a referendum. Politics Main article: Politics of New Caledonia New Caledonia is a territory sui generis to which France has gradually transferred certain powers. As such its citizens have French nationality and vote for the president of France . They have the right to vote in elections to the European Parliament . It is governed by a 54-member Territorial Congress , a legislative body composed of members of three provincial assemblies. The French State is represented in the territory by a High Commissioner . At a national level, New Caledonia is represented in the French Parliament by two deputies and two senators. At the 2012 French presidential election , the voter turnout in New Caledonia was 61.19%. For 25 years, the party system in New Caledonia was dominated by the anti-independence The Rally\u2013UMP . This dominance ended with the emergence of a new party, Avenir Ensemble , also opposed to independence, but considered more open to dialogue with the Kanak movement, which is part of the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front , a coalition of several pro-independence groups. In January 2025, Alcide Ponga was sworn in as President of the Government of New Caledonia , forming a new government following the collapse of the pro-independence government led by Louis Mapou . His leadership has been described as bringing stability following the 2024 unrest and a continuation for the country to remain within the French Republic . On October 2025, it was reported that that French MPs are fighting over the bill to delay New Caledonia\u2019s provincial elections to June 2026 under the Bougival Agreement. FLNKS and left MPs objected, filing approximately 1,600 amendments, and forced a referral to a joint committee. Customary authority Kanak society has several layers of customary authority, from the 4,000\u20135,000 family-based clans to the eight customary areas ( aires coutumi\u00e8res ) that make up the territory. Clans are led by clan chiefs and constitute 341 tribes, each headed by a tribal chief. The tribes are further grouped into 57 customary chiefdoms ( chefferies ), each headed by a head chief, and forming the administrative subdivisions of the customary areas. Jean L\u00e8ques during a ceremony honouring U.S. service members who helped ensure the freedom of New Caledonia during World War II The Customary Senate is the assembly of the various traditional councils of the Kanaks, and has jurisdiction over the law proposals concerning the Kanak identity. The Customary Senate is composed of 16 members appointed by each traditional council, with two representatives per customary area. In its advisory role, the Customary Senate must be consulted on law proposals \"concerning the Kanak identity\" as defined in the Noum\u00e9a Accord. It also has a deliberative role on law proposals that would affect identity, the civil customary statute, and the land system. A new president is appointed each year in August or September, and the presidency rotates between the eight customary areas. Kanak people have recourse to customary authorities regarding civil matters such as marriage, adoption, inheritance, and some land issues. The French administration typically respects decisions made in the customary system. However, their jurisdiction is sharply limited in penal matters, as some matters relating to the customary justice system, including the use of corporal punishment , are seen as clashing with the human rights obligations of France. Military and gendarmerie The Armed Forces of New Caledonia ( French : Forces arm\u00e9es de Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie , or FANC ) include about 2,000 soldiers, mainly deployed in Koumac , Nanda\u00ef , Tontouta , Plum , and Noum\u00e9a . The land forces consist of a regiment of the Troupes de marine , the R\u00e9giment d'infanterie de marine du Pacifique . About 80 percent of the 700-member regiment is composed of soldiers on short-term (four month) deployments from metropolitan France. As of 2018, only about 30 personnel in the regiment were locally recruited. The naval forces incorporate several vessels of the French Navy including: one Flor\u00e9al -class frigate , Vend\u00e9miaire , the patrol and support vessel D'Entrecasteaux and Auguste Benebig , the lead ship of the F\u00e9lix \u00c9bou\u00e9 class of patrol vessels. One EDA-S landing craft ( Sabre ) is also deployed to support operations in the territory. The French Navy will further reinforce its offshore patrol capabilities in New Caledonia by deploying a second vessel of the F\u00e9lix \u00c9bou\u00e9 class ( Jean Tranape ) to the territory by 2026. As of 2025/26, French naval aviation and air force elements in New Caledonia included two Navy Falcon 200 Gardian maritime surveillance aircraft (drawn from Flotilla 25F), which, as of 2025/26 are being replaced, on an interim basis, by the more advanced Falcon 50 aircraft . These aircraft will in turn be superseded by the new Falcon 2000 Albatros starting in about 2030. Two Casa CN235 transport aircraft and three Puma helicopters from the Air Force's 52 \"Tontouta\" Squadron are also deployed in New Caledonia. Prior to 2022, the frigate Vend\u00e9miaire operated the Alouette III helicopter . However, with the retirement of the type in 2022, it is being replaced by the Eurocopter Dauphin N3 . In 2022, the French Air Force demonstrated a capacity to reinforce the territory by deploying three Rafale fighters, supported by A400M transport aircraft and A330 MRTT Ph\u00e9nix tankers, from France to New Caledonia for a three-week exercise. In addition, some 855 personnel from the National Gendarmerie are stationed on the archipelago, divided into 4 companies, 27 brigades and several specialized, and mobile Gendarmerie units. During periods such the 2021 referendum on independence, these forces have been significantly reinforced with personnel deployed from metropolitan France. The air component includes two \u00c9cureuil helicopters while the Maritime Gendarmerie deploys the patrol boat Dumbea in the territory. Status Further information: Foreign relations of New Caledonia New Caledonia has been a member of the Pacific Community since 1983 with Noum\u00e9a the home of the organization's regional headquarters. Since 1986, the United Nations Committee on Decolonization has included New Caledonia on the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories . An independence referendum was held the following year, but independence was rejected by a large majority. Pyramid graph illustrating the administration of New Caledonia Under the Noum\u00e9a Accord , signed in 1998 following a period of secessionist unrest in the 1980s and approved in a referendum , New Caledonia was granted special status. Twenty years after inception, the Noum\u00e9a Accord required an referendum on independence which was held on 4 November 2018. The result was that 56.9% of voters chose to remain with France. The Noum\u00e9a Accord required another independence referendum , which was held on 4 October 2020. The result was that 53.26% of voters chose to remain with France. The third and last referendum permitted by the Noum\u00e9a Accord was held on 12 December 2021 , confirming New Caledonia as part of the French Republic with 96% voting \"no\" to independence after the vote was boycotted by the bulk of the Kanak population. The official name of the territory, Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie , could be changed in the near future due to the accord, which states that \"a name, a flag, an anthem, a motto, and the design of banknotes will have to be sought by all parties together, to express the Kanak identity and the future shared by all parties.\" To date, however, there has been no consensus on a new name for the territory, although Kanak Republic is popular among 40% of the population. New Caledonia has increasingly adopted its own symbols, choosing an anthem, a motto, and a new design for its banknotes. In July 2010, the Congress of New Caledonia voted in favour of a wish to fly the Kanak flag of the independence movement FLNKS alongside the French tricolour , as dual flags of the territory . The wish, legally non-binding, proved controversial. A majority of New Caledonian communes, but not all, now fly both flags, the rest flying only the French Tricolour. The non-official adoption made New Caledonia one of the few countries or territories in the world with two flags. The decision to wish for the use of two flags has been a constant battleground between the two sides and led the coalition government to collapse in February 2011. 2025 political talks in Paris Main article: Bougival Accord On 24 June 2025, President Emmanuel Macron extended an invitation to both pro\u2011 and anti\u2011independence leaders from New Caledonia to participate in talks in Paris starting 2 July 2025, aimed at negotiating the territory\u2019s future governance and status. Objectives of the talks include a revised political framework for New Caledonia, potentially including greater autonomy and redesigned electoral rules, socioeconomic challenges, such as the nickel-dependent economy, youth employment, and post\u2011unrest recovery. On 13 July 2025, weeks of negotiations concluded with an agreement between all parties that New Caledonia should remain within France, but with far greater levels of autonomy, the status of a state, and a dual citizenship arrangement for those that wish it. The agreement will require ratification by both chambers of the French parliamentary system, followed by a referendum in New Caledonia in 2026. Initial thoughts on the deal suggest it is not what independence supporters hoped for, but statehood is a major concession by France. On 13 August 2025, the FLNKS stated in a press conference that they had voted to reject the agreement on the basis that an independence referendum prior to France's 2027 presidential election was absent from the deal. On 16 September 2025, the New Caledonia Congress approved once again for the third time, another postponement, regarding the election within the territory. The votes were divided to 39 out of 52 Congress members (75%) voted in favor of the postponement, while the FLNKS pro-independence group cast 13 votes against (25%). Administrative divisions Main article: Administrative divisions of New Caledonia The institutional organization is the result of the organic law and ordinary law passed by the Parliament on 16 February 1999. The archipelago is divided into three provinces: South Province ( province Sud ). Provincial capital: Noum\u00e9a . Area: 9,407\u00a0km 2 . Population: 212,082 inhabitants (2019). North Province ( province Nord ). Provincial capital: Kon\u00e9 . Area: 7,348\u00a0km 2 . Population: 49,910 inhabitants (2019). Loyalty Islands Province ( province des \u00eeles Loyaut\u00e9 ). Provincial capital: Lifou . Area: 1,981\u00a0km 2 . Population: 18,353 inhabitants (2019). New Caledonia is further divided into 33 communes (municipalities). One commune, Poya , is divided between two provinces. The northern half of Poya, with the main settlement and most of the population, is part of the North Province, while the southern half of the commune, with only 210 inhabitants in 2019, is part of the South Province. Geography Main article: Geography of New Caledonia New Caledonia from space Coral reefs of New Caledonia from ISS, September 9, 2020 New Caledonia is part of Zealandia , a fragment of the ancient Gondwana super-continent, which is part of Oceania . It is speculated that New Caledonia separated from Australia roughly 66 million years ago, subsequently drifting in a north-easterly direction, reaching its present position about 50 million years ago. The mainland is divided in length by a central mountain range whose highest peaks are Mont Pani\u00e9 (1,629\u00a0m or 5,344\u00a0ft) in the north and Mont Humboldt (1,618\u00a0m or 5,308\u00a0ft) in the southeast. The east coast is covered by lush vegetation. The west coast, with its large savannahs and plains suitable for farming, is a drier area. Many ore-rich massifs are found along this coast. The Diahot River is the longest river of New Caledonia, flowing for some 100 kilometres (62\u00a0mi). It has a catchment area of 620\u00a0km 2 (240\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and opens north-westward into the Baie d'Harcourt , flowing towards the northern point of the island along the western escarpment of the Mount Pani\u00e9. Most of the island is covered by wet evergreen forests, while savannahs dominate the lower elevations. The New Caledonian lagoon, with a total area of 24,000 square kilometres (9,300\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) is one of the largest lagoons in the world. The lagoon and the surrounding New Caledonia Barrier Reef was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008 for its exceptional beauty and marine biodiversity. In May 2023, there was an earthquake and tsunami in New Caledonia. This triggered a tsunami warning here as well as in other nearby countries. Climate The climate is tropical , with a hot and humid season from November to March with temperatures between 27 and 30\u00a0\u00b0C (81 and 86\u00a0\u00b0F), and a cooler, dry season from June to August with temperatures between 20 and 23\u00a0\u00b0C (68 and 73\u00a0\u00b0F), linked by two short interstices. The tropical climate is strongly moderated by the oceanic influence and the trade winds that attenuate humidity, which can be close to 80%. The average annual temperature is 23\u00a0\u00b0C, with historical extremes of 2.3 and 39.1\u00a0\u00b0C (36.1 and 102.4\u00a0\u00b0F). The rainfall records show that precipitation differs greatly within the island. The 3,000 millimetres (120\u00a0in) of rainfall recorded in Galarino are three times the average of the west coast. There are also dry periods, because of the effects of El Ni\u00f1o . Between December and April, tropical depressions and cyclones can cause winds to exceed a speed of 100 kilometres per hour (62\u00a0mph), with gusts of 250 kilometres per hour (160\u00a0mph) and very abundant rainfall. The last cyclone affecting New Caledonia was Cyclone Niran , in March 2021. Environment See also: Biodiversity of New Caledonia Landscape in the south of New Caledonia New Caledonia has many unique taxa, especially birds and plants. It has the richest diversity in the world per square kilometre. The biodiversity is caused by Grande Terre's central mountain range, which has created a variety of niches, landforms and micro-climates where endemic species thrive. Largely due to its nickel industry, New Caledonia emits a high level of carbon dioxide per person compared to other countries. In 2019, it emitted 55.25 tons of CO 2 per person, compared to 4.81 for France. The combination of the exceptional biodiversity of New Caledonia and its threatened status has made it one of the most critical biodiversity hotspots on Earth. In 2001, Bruno Van Peteghem was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize for his efforts on behalf of the Caledonian ecological protection movement in the face of \"serious challenges\" from Jacques Lafleur 's RPCR party. Progress has been made in a few areas in addressing the protection of New Caledonia's ecological diversity from fire, industrial and residential development, unrestricted agricultural activity and mining (such as the judicial revocation of INCO 's mining licence in June 2006 owing to claimed abuses). In 2008, six lagoons of the New Caledonian barrier reef , the world's longest continuous barrier reef system, were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List . Flora Amborella , the world's oldest living lineage of flowering plant Araucaria columnaris on the Isle of Pines New Caledonia's fauna and flora derive from ancestral species isolated in the region when it broke away from Gondwana many tens of millions of years ago. Not only endemic species have evolved here, but entire genera , families , and even orders are unique to the islands. More tropical gymnosperm species are endemic to New Caledonia than to any similar region on Earth. Of the 44 indigenous species of gymnosperms, 43 are endemic, including the only known parasitic gymnosperm ( Parasitaxus usta ). Also, of the 35 known species of Araucaria , 13 are endemic to New Caledonia. New Caledonia also has the world's most divergent lineage of flowering plant , Amborella trichopoda , which is at, or near, the base of the clade of all flowering plants. The world's largest extant species of fern , Sphaeropteris intermedia , also is endemic to New Caledonia. It is very common on acidic soil, usually found on fallow ground or in forest clearings, and grows about one metre per year on the east coast. There also are other species of tree ferns , notably Sphaeropteris novae-caledoniae . New Caledonia also is one of five regions on the planet where species of southern beeches ( Nothofagus ) are indigenous; five species are known to occur here. New Caledonia has its own version of maquis ( maquis minier ) occurring on metalliferous soils, mostly in the south. The soils of ultramafic rocks (mining terrains) have been a refuge for many native flora species which are adapted to the toxic mineral content of the soils, to which most foreign species of plants are poorly suited, which has therefore prevented invasion into the habitat or displacement of indigenous plants. Two terrestrial ecoregions lie within New Caledonia's territory: New Caledonia rain forests and New Caledonia dry forests . See also: List of endemic plants of New Caledonia Fauna In addition to its outstanding plant diversity and endemism, New Caledonia also provides habitat for a wide diversity of animals. Over 100 bird species live in New Caledonia, of which 24 are endemic. One of these endemic bird species is the New Caledonian crow , a bird noted for its tool-making abilities, which rival those of primates. These crows are renowned for their extraordinary intelligence and ability to fashion tools to solve problems, and make the most complex tools of any animal yet studied apart from humans. The kagu , an endemic flightless bird The endemic kagu , agile and able to run quickly, is a flightless bird, but it is able to use its wings to climb branches or glide. Its sound is similar to the bark of a dog. It is the surviving member of monotypic family Rhynochetidae , order Eurypygiformes . There are 11 endemic fish species and 14 endemic species of decapod crustaceans in the rivers and lakes of New Caledonia. Some, such as Neogalaxias , exist only in small areas. The nautilus \u2014considered a living fossil and related to the ammonites , which became extinct at the end of the Mesozoic era\u2014occurs in Pacific waters around New Caledonia. There is a large diversity of marine fish in the surrounding waters, which are within the extents of the Coral Sea . Despite its large number of bird, reptile, and fish species, New Caledonia has remarkably few mammal species: nine, of which six are endemic. Several species of New Caledonia are remarkable for their size: Ducula goliath is the largest extant species of arboreal pigeon; Rhacodactylus leachianus , the largest gecko in the world; Phoboscincus bocourti , a large skink thought to be extinct until rediscovered in 2003. Much of New Caledonia's fauna present before human settlement is now extinct, including Sylviornis , a bird over a metre tall not closely related to any living species, and Meiolania , a giant horned turtle that diverged from living turtles during the Jurassic period. In January 2024, a court in the Capital Noum\u00e9a issued a ruling banning the culling of sharks citing it as disproportionate. The culls began after an Australian tourist was killed by a shark in the previous year. See also: List of birds of New Caledonia Demographics Main article: Demographics of New Caledonia At the last census in April 2025, New Caledonia had a population of 264,596, down from 271,407 at the September 2019 census, as people left the territory due to an economic crisis and the 2024 New Caledonia unrest . Of these 264,596 people, 18,671 lived in the Loyalty Islands Province , 50,947 in the North Province , and 194,978 in the South Province . Between the 2019 and 2025 censuses, the North Province and the Loyalty Islands registered a population increase of 2.1% and 1.7% respectively, whereas the South Province registered a population decline of 4.0%, as newcomers recently arrived in the Greater Noum\u00e9a area, in particular Kanak people, left Noum\u00e9a and relocated in the rest of New Caledonia due to the depressed economy in the Greater Noum\u00e9a area following the 2024 unrest and urban riots. 30% of the population was under the age of 20, with the ratio of older people in the total population increasing. Two out of three residents of New Caledonia live in Greater Noum\u00e9a . 78% were born in New Caledonia. The total fertility rate decreased from 2.2 children per woman in 2014 to 1.9 in 2019. Ethnic groups At the 2019 census, 41.2% of the population reported belonging to the Kanak community (up from 39.1% at the 2014 census ) and 24.1% to the European ( Caldoche and Zoreille ) community (down from 27.2% at the 2014 census). A further 7.5% of the population either self-identified as \"Caledonian\" or refused to declare an ethnic group (down from 9.9% at the 2014 census). Most of the people who self-identify as \"Caledonian\" or refuse to declare an ethnic group are thought to be ethnically European. The other self-reported communities were Wallisians and Futunians (8.3% of the total population, up from 8.2% at the 2014 census), Indonesians who are from the Javanese ethnic group (1.4% of the total population, the same as in 2014), Tahitians (2.0% of the total population, down from 2.1% at the 2014 census), Ni-Vanuatu (0.9%, down from 1.0% at the 2014 census), Vietnamese (0.8%, down from 0.9% at the 2014 census), and other Asians (primarily ethnic Chinese ; 0.4% of the total population, the same as in 2014). 11.3% of the population reported belonging to multiple communities ( mixed race ) (up from 8.6% at the 2014 census). The question on community belonging, which had been left out of the 2004 census, was reintroduced in 2009 under a new formulation, different from the 1996 census, allowing multiple choices (mixed race) and the possibility to clarify the choice \"other\" (which led many Europeans to self-identify as \"Caledonian\" in the category \"other\", or to select several ethnic communities, such as both European and Kanak, thus appearing as mixed race, which is particularly the case for the Caldoches living in the bush, who often have mixed ancestry). Finally, 2.1% of the population reported belonging to other communities to the exclusion of \"Caledonian\" (up from 1.3% at the 2014 census). The Kanak people, part of the ethnic Melanesian group, are indigenous to New Caledonia. Their social organization is traditionally based on clans , which identify as either \"land\" or \"sea\" clans, depending on their original location and the occupation of their ancestors. According to the 2019 census, the Kanak constitute 95% of the population in the Loyalty Islands Province , 72% in the North Province and 29% in the South Province. The Kanak tend to be of lower socio-economic status than the Europeans and other settlers. Europeans first settled in New Caledonia when France established a penal colony on the archipelago. Once the prisoners had completed their sentences, they were given land to settle. According to the 2014 census, of the 73,199 Europeans in New Caledonia, 30,484 were native-born , 36,975 were born in Metropolitan France , 488 were born in French Polynesia , 86 were born in Wallis and Futuna , and 5,166 were born abroad. The Europeans are divided into several groups. The Caldoches are usually defined as those born in New Caledonia who have ancestral ties that span back to the early French settlers. They often settled in the rural areas of the western coast of Grande Terre, where many continue to run large cattle properties. Distinct from the Caldoches are those who were born in New Caledonia from families that had settled more recently, and are called simply Caledonians. The Metropolitan French -born migrants who come to New Caledonia are called M\u00e9tros or Zoreilles , indicating their origins in metropolitan France. There is also a community of about 2,000 pieds noirs , descended from European settlers in France's former North African colonies; some of them are prominent in anti-independence politics, including Pierre Maresca , a leader of the RPCR . A 2015 documentary by Al Jazeera English asserted that up to 10% of New Caledonia's population is descended from around 2,000 Arab - Berber people deported from French Algeria in the late 19th century to prisons on the island in reprisal for the Mokrani Revolt in 1871. After serving their sentences, they were released and given land to own and cultivate as part of colonisation efforts on the island. As the overwhelming majority of the Algerians imprisoned on New Caledonia were men, the community was continued through intermarriage with women of other ethnic groups, mainly French women from nearby women's prisons. Despite facing both assimilation into the Euro-French population and discrimination for their ethnic background, descendants of the deportees have succeeded in preserving a common identity as Algerians, including maintaining certain cultural practices (such as Arabic names) and in some cases Islamic religion. Some travel to Algeria as a rite of passage, though obtaining Algerian citizenship is often a difficult process. The largest population of Algerian-Caledonians lives in the commune of Bourail (particularly in the Nessadiou district, where there is an Islamic cultural centre and cemetery ), with smaller communities in Noum\u00e9a , Kon\u00e9 , Pouembout , and Yat\u00e9 . Kanak women Rodeos (here at the annual fair of Bourail ) are part of Caldoche culture. Languages Main article: Languages of New Caledonia The French language began to spread with the establishment of French settlements, and French is now spoken even in the most secluded villages. For a long time the level of fluency varied significantly across the population as a whole, primarily due to the absence of universal access to public education before 1953, and also due to immigration and ethnic diversity, but the French language has now become universal among the younger generations as shown by the censuses of population. At the 2009 census, 97.3% of people aged 15 or older reported that they could speak, read and write French, whereas only 1.1% reported that they had no knowledge of French. No questions regarding the knowledge of French were asked in the 2014 and 2019 censuses, on account of the population's nearly universal understanding of it. The 28 Kanak languages spoken in New Caledonia are part of the Oceanic group of the Austronesian family. Eight of these can be chosen by parents as optional subjects for their children from kindergarten to high school (four languages are taught up to the bachelor's degree) and an academy is responsible for their promotion. The three most widely spoken indigenous languages are Drehu (spoken in Lifou ), Nengone (spoken on Mar\u00e9 ) and Paic\u00ee (northern part of Grande Terre). Others include Iaai (spoken on Ouv\u00e9a ). At the 2019 census, 44.0% of people whose age was 15 or older reported that they had some form of knowledge of at least one Kanak language (up from 41.3% at the 2009 census), whereas 56.0% reported that they had no knowledge of any of the Kanak languages (down from 58.7% at the 2009 census). Other significant language communities among immigrant populations include speakers of Wallisian , Futunian , Tahitian , Javanese , Vietnamese , Chinese , and Bislama . Religion Religion in New Caledonia according to the Global Religious Landscape survey by the Pew Forum , 2012 Christianity (85.2%) No religion (10.4%) Islam (2.80%) Buddhism (0.60%) Folk religion (0.20%) Others (0.80%) The predominant religion is Christianity ; half of the population is Catholic , including most of the Europeans, West Uveans , and Vietnamese and half of the Melanesian and Polynesian minorities. Catholicism was introduced by French colonists. The island also has numerous Protestant churches, of which the Free Evangelical Church and the Evangelical Church in New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands have the largest number of adherents; their memberships are almost entirely Melanesian. Protestantism gained ground in the late 20th century and continues to expand. There are also numerous other Christian groups and more than 6,000 Muslims. (See Islam in New Caledonia and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in New Caledonia .) Noum\u00e9a is the seat of the Archdiocese of Noum\u00e9a . Education Education in New Caledonia is based on the French curriculum and delivered by both French teachers and French-trained teachers. Under the terms of the 1998 Noum\u00e9a Accord , primary education is the responsibility of the three provinces. As of 2010, secondary education was in the process of being transferred to the provinces. The majority of schools are located in Noum\u00e9a but some are found in the islands and the north of New Caledonia. When students reach high school age, most are sent to Noum\u00e9a to continue their secondary education. Education is compulsory from the age of six years. New Caledonia's main tertiary education institution is the University of New Caledonia ( Universit\u00e9 de la Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie ), which was founded in 1993 and comes under the supervision of the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation . It is based in Noum\u00e9a and offers a range of vocational, Bachelor, MA, and PhD programs and courses. The University of New Caledonia consists of three academic departments, one institute of technology, one PhD school, and one teachers' college. As of 2013, the university has approximately 3,000 students, 107 academics, and 95 administrative and library staff. Many New Caledonian students also pursue scholarships to study in metropolitan France. As part of the Noum\u00e9a Accord process, a Cadre Avenir provides scholarships for Kanak professionals to study in France. Economy Main article: Economy of New Caledonia New Caledonia has one of the largest economies in the South Pacific, with a GDP of US$9.48 billion in 2019. The nominal GDP per capita was US$34,939 (at market exchange rates) in 2019. It is lower than the nominal GDP per capita of Hawaii , Australia , New Zealand , and Guam , but higher than all other independent and non-sovereign countries and territories in Oceania , although there is significant inequality in income distribution, and long-standing structural imbalances between the economically dominant South Province and the less developed North Province and Loyalty Islands. The currency in use in New Caledonia is the CFP franc , as of May 2020, pegged to the euro at a rate of 119.3 CFP to 1.00 euros. It is issued by the Institut d'\u00c9mission d'Outre-Mer. Real GDP grew by an average of +3.3% per year in the first half of the 2010s, boosted by rising worldwide nickel prices and an increase in domestic demand due to rising employment, as well as strong business investments, but by only +0.2% per year in the second half of the 2010s, as the local nickel industry entered a period of crisis and the repeated independence referendums have generated economic uncertainty. In 2017, exports of goods and services from New Caledonia amounted to 1.93\u00a0billion US dollars, 77.5% of which were mineral products and alloys (mainly nickel ore and ferronickel ) and 5.0% exports of hotel and restaurant services (i.e. international tourism in New Caledonia). Imports of goods and services amounted to 3.48\u00a0billion US dollars. 40.9% of the imports of goods came from Metropolitan France and its overseas departments , 11.7% from Singapore (essentially fuel), 11.5% from Australia, 5.0% from other countries in the European Union , 4.2% from China and Hong Kong, 4.1% from New Zealand, 3.7% from South Korea, 2.4% from Japan, 2.0% from the United States, 1.9% from Canada, and 12.6% from other countries. The trade deficit in goods and services stood at 1.55 billion US dollars in 2017. Financial support from France is substantial, representing more than 15% of the GDP, and contributes to the health of the economy. Tourism is underdeveloped, with 100,000 visitors a year, compared to 400,000 in the Cook Islands and 200,000 in Vanuatu . Much of the land is unsuitable for agriculture, and food accounts for about 20% of imports. According to FAOSTAT , New Caledonia is a significant producer of: yams (33rd); taro (44th); plantains (50th); coconuts (52nd). The exclusive economic zone of New Caledonia covers 1.4\u00a0million square kilometres (0.54\u00a0million square miles). The construction sector accounts for roughly 12% of GDP, employing 9.9% of the salaried population in 2010. Manufacturing is largely confined to small-scale activities such as the transformation of foodstuffs, textiles and plastics. 54,391 42,274 63,997 34,939 37,794 2,315 21,673 3,187 2,278 6,079 18,360 4,472 13,352 22,752 4,435 24,670 15,992 4,001 5,275 1,847 10,567 5,277 Nickel sector Main article: Nickel mining in New Caledonia See also: Geology of New Caledonia A creek in southern New Caledonia. Red colours reveal the richness of the ground in iron oxides and nickel. New Caledonian soils contain about 25% of the world's nickel resources. The late-2000s recession has gravely affected the nickel industry, as the sector faced a significant drop in nickel prices (\u221231.0% year-on-year in 2009) for the second consecutive year. The fall in prices has led a number of producers to reduce or stop altogether their activity, resulting in a reduction of the global supply of nickel by 6% compared to 2008. This context, combined with bad weather, has forced the operators in the sector to revise downwards their production target. Thus, the activity of mineral extraction has declined by 8% in volume year on year. The share of the nickel sector as a percentage of GDP fell from 8% in 2008 to 5% in 2009. A trend reversal and a recovery in demand have been recorded early in the second half of 2009, allowing a 2.0% increase in the local metal production. A March 2020 report stated that \"New Caledonia is the world's fourth largest nickel producer, which has seen a 26% rally in prices in the past year\". According to industry sources however, the Goro mine has never met its potential capacity to produce \"60,000 tpy of nickel in the form of nickel oxide, due to design flaws and operational commissioning issues\" In 2019, it produced slightly over a third of its annual capacity\". In March 2021, Tesla agreed to a partnership with the Goro Mine, a \"technical and industrial partnership to help with product and sustainability standards along with taking nickel for its battery production, according to the agreement\", according to a BBC News report. The majority owner, Vale, said that the deal will be of long-term benefit in terms of jobs and the economy. Tesla is a heavy user of nickel for making the lithium-ion batteries and wanted to \"secure its long-term supply\". Also in March 2021, a part of Vale's nickel business was sold \"to a consortium called Prony, which includes Swiss commodity trader Trafigura \". Provincial authorities and businesses in New Caledonia would have a 51% stake in the Vale operation. Culture Caldoches , European people born in New Caledonia Wood carving , especially of the houp ( Montrouziera cauliflora ), is a contemporary reflection of the beliefs of the traditional tribal society, and includes totems , masks, chambranles , or fl\u00e8che fa\u00eeti\u00e8re , a kind of arrow that adorns the roofs of Kanak houses. Basketry is a craft widely practised by tribal women, creating objects of daily use. The Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Centre , designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano and opened in 1998, celebrates Kanak culture. The Kaneka is a form of local music, inspired by reggae and originating in the 1980s. The Mw\u00e2 Ka is a 12-metre (39\u00a0ft) totem pole commemorating the French annexation of New Caledonia, and was inaugurated in 2005. Media Les Nouvelles Cal\u00e9doniennes is the only daily newspaper in the archipelago. A monthly publication, Le Chien bleu , parodies the news from New Caledonia. There are five radio stations: the public service broadcaster RFO radio Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie , Oc\u00e9ane FM (the collectivity's newest station), the youth-oriented station NRJ , Radio Djiido (established by Jean-Marie Tjibaou ), and Radio Rythmes Bleus . The last two stations are primarily targeted to the various Kanak groups who are indigenous to New Caledonia (\"Djiido\" is a term from the Fw\u00e2i language , spoken in Hiengh\u00e8ne in the North Province , denoting a metal spike used to secure straw thatching to the roof of a traditional Kanak house). As for television, the public service broadcaster France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions operates a local channel, R\u00e9seau Outre-Mer 1re , along with France 2 , France 3 , France 4 , France 5 , France 24 and Arte which all broadcast from Paris . Canal Plus Cal\u00e9donie carries 17 digital channels in French, including Canal+ and TF1 . Analogue television broadcasts ended in September 2011, completing the digital television transition in New Caledonia. Bids for two new local television stations, NCTV and NC9, were considered by the French broadcasting authorities. NCTV was launched in December 2013. The media are considered to be able to operate freely, but Reporters Without Borders raised concerns in 2006 about \"threats and intimidation\" of RFO staff by members of a pro-independence group.

The New Caledonia women's national volleyball team won the gold medal on several occasions. Cuisine Due to low levels of domestic horticulture, fresh tropical fruits feature less highly in New Caledonian cuisine than in other Pacific nations, instead relying on rice, fish and root vegetables such as taro . One way this is frequently prepared is in a buried-oven-style feast, known as bougna . Wrapped in banana leaves , the fish, taro, banana and other seafood are buried with hot rocks to cook, then dug up and eaten.

{"id": "doc_random_116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature%27s_Rising_(song)", "text": "\" Temperature's Rising \" is the third single from Mobb Deep 's second album, The Infamous . Produced by Q-Tip , the song features R&B singer Crystal Johnson and contains a sample of \"Where There Is Love\" by Patrice Rushen . Background The song was written in the form of a letter to an associate that is hiding from the police, who went by the name Killa Black, who was also the older brother of Havoc . Killa Black, according to Prodigy in his 2011 autobiography My Infamous Life: The Autobiography of Mobb Deep's Prodigy , murdered a man over Walkman speakers, and Havoc hid Killa Black's gun in his basket of clothes. In the song, the narrator reveals that he is covering up evidence of his imprisoned friend's criminal actions, and speaks of his paranoia, fearing that the police are closing in on him. After being released, Killa Black became a Muslim. A few years after the song was released, Killa Black committed suicide, in his mother's bathroom, from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head after coming home for the murder that is mentioned in the song. Prior to his suicide, he had been committed to a psychiatric hospital. The B-side is \" Give Up the Goods (Just Step) \". There is a remix to the single, also produced by Q-Tip, that utilizes the same Patrice Rushen sample that is used on the album version. The original version of the song was produced by Mobb Deep.

Derborence above the lake Derborence is a hamlet in the municipality of Conthey , in the canton of Valais , in Switzerland . It is located at 1,450 metres in an isolated valley on the south side of the Bernese Alps and is not permanently inhabited. Derborence is completely surrounded by mountains: The Diablerets (highest) on the north, Haut de Cry on the south and Mont Gond on the east. Derborence can be reached by a road from Conthey, or by foot from Gryon , using the Pas de Cheville . Valley of Derborence Lake Derborence was formed in 1749 after two landslides coming from the south wall of the Diablerets. Thousands of tons of rock came crashing down from a height of 1900 metres in 1714 and 1749, coming to 400 metres below and forming a 2 kilometre-long natural barrier which gradually filled with water. A virgin forest grew on the rock debris. It consists of spruce , pine , larch , scots pine , beech and willows . The area was acquired by Pro Natura in 1961 and is now protected. The valley, which is exceptionally rich in fauna, is a natural habitat for ibex , chamois , deer , marmots and hares and several bird species including the owl , golden eagle , bearded vulture and alpine chough.

These convulsions, which give notice of their occurrence by subterraneous noises, last took place in the years 1714 and 1749.

{"id": "doc_random_119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calnev_Pipeline", "text": "The Calnev Pipeline is a 550-mile (890\u00a0km) long buried refined oil products pipeline in the United States , owned by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners . The pipeline consists of two parallel lines, the larger, has a diameter of 14 inches (360\u00a0mm) and the smaller one has a diameter of 8 inches (200\u00a0mm). The lines carry gasoline , jet fuel , and diesel fuel from Los Angeles , California , refineries as far as Nellis Air Force Base south of North Las Vegas, Nevada . It carries approximately 128,000 barrels per day (20,400\u00a0m 3 /d). Jet fuel from the pipeline is also delivered to the Harry Reid International Airport tank farm in Paradise . Additional terminal facilities are located in Barstow, California . The line was the sole source for the products it delivers to Las Vegas until the Unev pipeline began operating in 2012. UNEV provides access to refined oil products from Utah . Accidents and incidents On December 22, 1980, the pipeline carrying jet fuel ruptured in the Las Vegas Valley , near Tropicana Avenue , spilling fuel for 2 hours. Later, the fuel ignited, forcing road closures. One firefighter was overcome by fumes. Between 50,000 and 100,000 US gallons (190,000 and 380,000\u00a0L) of jet fuel were spilled. Prior construction in the area was suspected of damaging the pipeline. On May 12, 1989, a Southern Pacific Railroad train derailed in San Bernardino, California , directly over the pipeline. Later that same month On May 25, 1989, The Calnev Pipeline ruptured in the same location, causing a fire that killed two people. The definitive cause of the pipeline rupture is not known as the pipeline was in the process of being dug up to be visually inspected after the train derailment. The National Transportation Safety Board theorizes that the pipeline was somehow damaged from the cleanup of the train derailment, that occurred thirteen days earlier. Impacts Environmental In 2010, Kinder Morgan proposed an expansion project which would add a third, 16-inch pipeline to accompany the two existing pipelines. Several organizations, as well as state government agencies, responded to the CalNev Expansion Project such as the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and the Nevada Department of Wildlife. The project proposed building across Cajon Creek Conservation Area in San Bernardino which would affect over 20 sensitive species. Construction would alter the area's hydrological regime and pose a risk to the animals living in this area. Certain areas of the pipeline also require replacing depleted areas of cathodic protection , which protect the pipeline from rust and potential leaks. In 2015, the cathodic protection system of the pipeline that passes through the Mojave National Preserve needed to be repaired. This repair construction disrupts nearby habitats. However, to omit repair greatly increases the risk of an oil spill . Route The CalNev Pipeline begins in Los Angeles, California, runs through with terminal stops in San Bernardino County in the cities of Colton and Barstow and ends outside of Las Vegas, Nevada. Regulations Current All pipelines in the United States have to adhere to the regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) . PHMSA sets regulations pertaining to the operation, construction, expansion of pipelines, which private pipeline companies have to adhere to, with federal and state inspectors enforcement. Calnev is an interstate pipeline crossing California and Nevada therefore it is managed by PMHSA and inspected by federal agents. However, portions of pipeline exclusively within California or Nevada could be inspected by respective state agencies. In 2016, there were seven broad system-wide program inspections and two targeted investigations intended to scrutinize certain safety features in regards to the pipeline. According to PMHSA\u2019s Pipeline Safety Stakeholder Communications data, Calnev has had one case in the last ten years in which PHMSA issued a Corrective Action Order in 2004 against Kinder Morgan in regards to a failure in Calnev Pipeline which released gasoline to its environment, an order that was marked closed in 2007. There was no proposed or collected penalty. Future Recently , then-President Donald Trump issued a key memorandum altering previous regulations regarding the construction of pipelines in the United States. Issued on January 24, 2017, this memorandum includes expediting the construction of future American pipelines, such as the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline , as well as high priority infrastructure projects. One of the key developments stated in this memorandum is that all future new and expanding pipelines to be constructed in the United States were to be built with materials \u201cproduced within the United States.\" In which case, the Calnev expansion project would need to add a new section in their proposal explaining what materials would be used for construction for the current proposal does not address this. Other important new regulations include those mentioned in the order to expedite environmental reviews and approvals on high priority infrastructure projects, which were defined by then-President Trump to include \u201ccritical...pipelines\u201d. With this memorandum, the chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) has the power to decide whether a project is \u201chigh priority\u201d or not within 30 days of receiving project requests in efforts to streamline the approval process. Expansion plans On July 23, 2007, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners announced that it will expand the pipeline by constructing an additional 16-inch (410\u00a0mm) pipeline alongside the existing pipelines. It will increase the total pipeline system capacity to 200,000 barrels per day (32,000\u00a0m 3 /d), and with additional pumping stations to more than 300,000 barrels per day (48,000\u00a0m 3 /d).

It was recorded in 1977 at the Onkio Haus in Tokyo with bassist Clint Houston and Motohiko Hino on drums. The opening tracks of either side of the LP include trumpeter Terumasa Hino , the drummer's brother. The album was released under the title John Scofield in 1978 by Trio Records in Japan. After Trio closed, BlackHawk Records released the album in 1987 under the title East Meets West . Storyville Records reissued the album with part of the original design restored, using a cropped photograph of Scofield standing by the Hudson River. Scofield had his major breakthrough playing with Miles Davis by the time of the Black Hawk re-release. According to Herb Wong in the liner notes, Scofield was the first guitarist to transfer \"post-Coltrane harmonic language, integrating much of the idiom saxophonists have been working on.\" Terumasa Hino and John Scofield Terumasa Hino and John Scofield played several times together, especially in 1977. On August 10 and 11, on the eve of this recording session, all four musicians had already recorded the tracks for Hino's Hip Seagull at Victor Studios in Tokyo as part of a greater ensemble. The more fusion-oriented album was finished later that year in New York, where Terumasa Hino and John Scofield had a recording date in May 1977, together with Ron Carter and Tony Williams for Hino's album May Dance . Both albums were released on Flying Disk. Scofield and Hino were also part of the Dave Liebman Quintet around 1980 and recorded together again in the 1990s for Hino's album Bluestruck for Blue Note (1990) and his Led Zeppelin tribute album It's There ( Enja , 1995).

{"id": "doc_random_122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Operations_Tactical_Unit", "text": "The Unidad T\u00e1ctica de Operaciones Policiales (UTOP; Police Operations Tactical Unit ) is the riot control unit of Bolivia 's National Police . The unit was founded in 1976 as the Grupo Especializado de Seguridad (GES; Specialized Security Group ). The unit has been involved in confronting numerous protests and civil disturbances, and provides security around the principal government buildings in La Paz, Bolivia's seat of government. Initially, the GES was based in the La Paz's wealthy Zona Sur, at a site now occupied by the command center of Police District 4. Its current headquarters is in La Paz , on Junin Street, just northeast of Plaza Murillo , between Indaburo and Ingavi streets. GES troops engaged in mutinies during times of social protest in April 2000 and February 2003. UTOP troops have also led police mutinies in June 2012, November 2013, and July 2014. History The Grupo Especializado de Seguridad was created in 1976. During the late 1980s, the GES temporarily assumed counterterrorist functions. In March 1987, French police advisers and Bolivian experts began giving a three-month antiterrorism course \u2014 consisting of technical and psychological training \u2014 to 400 GES members. The purpose of the training was to form a special group for responding to hostage-taking incidents. That June the Bolivian police announced officially the creation of a 22-member antiterrorist command, the Multi-purpose Intervention Brigade ( Brigada de Intervention Polivalente \u2014 BIP), responsible for solving cases of \"uncommon violence,\" such as kidnapping, hostage taking, and antigovernment uprisings. The government of President Paz Zamora gave responsibility for antiterrorist actions to the Special Elite Antiterrorist Force ( Fuerza Especial Antiterrorista de Elite \u2014 FEAE). In April 2000, President Hugo Banzer declared a state of siege in response to the Cochabamba Water War and a general strike by the CSUTCB Peasant Confederation. GES troops refused to participate in policing during the crisis and the government agreed to increases in salary for the police. Amid protests in February 2003 over a proposed tax on salaries and wages, GES troops mutinied on February 11 and left the city center of La Paz unpoliced. The military was mobilized to the central Plaza Murillo, where they exchanged fire with the GES. As of 2003, the GES had 21 officers and 235 troops. In 2013, the government announced the creation of an UTOP unit for El Alto, to consist of 200 troops headquartered in the Huayna Potos\u00ed district.

{"id": "doc_random_124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Blucher_(1815_ship)", "text": "For other ships with the same name, see List of ships named Blucher . Prince Blucher was launched at Chittagong in 1815. She made one voyage for the British East India Company . She participated in two and possibly three rescues, one particularly notable, and was wrecked in 1821. Condemned, she was laid up and later broken up in 1824. Career First rescue \u2013 Frances Charlotte : Frances Charlotte left Batavia on 18 September 1816 bound for Bengal, carrying the 78th Highlanders regiment, together with their wives and children. On 5 November Frances Charlotte struck a sunken reef off Preparis . On 10 November Prince Blucher , Captain Weathrall, was sailing in the vicinity when she spied wreckage. Weathrall investigated and when he saw a signal fire stopped to render assistance. Between 11 and 14 November Prince Blucher was able to rescue some 316 men, women, and children before bad weather forced her to leave. She took the survivors to Calcutta , where the Bengal Government dispatched two cruisers to rescue the 130 or so remaining survivors. At Calcutta, Weathrall and his men received great praise for their efforts. The Governor-General, on behalf of the government of Bengal, awarded Weathrall 5000 sicca rupees for plate. It also awarded money to his officers and crew. The merchants of Calcutta awarded Weathrall with an engraved silver plate. EIC voyage (1817): Captain M. T. Weathrall sailed from Calcutta on 1 February 1817. Prince Blucher reached the Cape of Good Hope on 29 April, and arrived at Portsmouth on 30 June. She had carried some of the surviving 78th Highlanders. Second rescue: Captain Weathrall sailed Prince Blucher from England on 23 August and Madeira on 21 September. On 21 January 1818 she encountered at 20\u00b000\u2032N 87\u00b056\u2032E \ufeff / \ufeff 20.000\u00b0N 87.933\u00b0E \ufeff / 20.000; 87.933 a boat of pilgrims that had been driven out to sea from Saugor some nine day earlier. They were completely without food or water. Eight had died, two died after Prince Blucher got them aboard, and one more died thereafter. Still, Weathrall was able to bring safely into Calcutta, \"eight Brahmans, four women, and twenty-six Bengalees\". In 1818 Captain James Henry Johnston took command of Prince Blucher . In her he sailed twice to London. Third rescue: On 7 February 1819, Iris , Jones, master, wrecked on Canda Island, on her way from London to Bombay. (Canda, or Candy, or Candu Island does not exist. ) Contemporary accounts believed that the island was east of the Chagos Archipelago .) Lloyd's List reported on 13 August 1819, that Iris had wrecked on \"Solomon or Canda Island\"; this would suggest that \"Solomon Island\" was the Salomon Islands , a small atoll in the Chagos Archipelago. Lloyd's List further reported that Prince Blucher had rescued Jones and some of the crew but that the rest of Iris ' s crew had remained on the island, and it was expected that most of the cargo would be saved. Prince Blucher had taken with her 40,000 dollars that Iris had been carrying. The Asiatic Journal... has an account of the wrecking and a subsequent dispute between Captain Lewis Jones and Captain Lagour, master of a French schooner, respecting compensation for passage for Jones and some of his crew to India. The account makes no mention of Prince Blucher . Lloyd's List reported on 23 June 1820, that Prince Blucher , Johnston, master, had arrived in England from Bengal. She had left Bengal on 11 February 1820, and reached the Cape of Good Hope on 5 April. She left the Cape on 18 April, and reached Ascension Island on 5 May. On the morning of 22 June Prince Blucher grounded on the Shivering Sands in the Thames Estuary . That afternoon some smacks got her off; she arrived in the Thames River on the 24th. Prince Blucher , Johnston, master, left London on 24 September and arrived at Bengal on 13 February 1821. Loss On 3 May 1821 Prince Blucher sailed from Bengal for Mauritius. She then stranded on the James and Mary Shoal in the Ganges River. She was refloated but was so badly damaged she had to be taken back to Calcutta. There she was condemned in June and laid up. She was finally broken up in 1824 at Fort Gloster. Her entry in Lloyd's Register for 1823 carried the annotation \"condemned\".

Career Once dubbed as \u201cAsia's Swim Queen,\" Coloso-Espino won a total of ten medals from the 1954 Asian Games , 1958 Asian Games and 1962 Asian Games . Of those medals, three were gold, five were silver, and two were bronze. Her gold medals came from the 100-meter freestyle and butterfly events. Coloso was just 16 years old when she won two gold medals and a silver medal at the 1954 Asian Games in Manila . She came from behind to beat Japanese swimmers Tomiko Atarashi and Shizue Miyabe in the 100m freestyle final at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex pool. She also led the hosts to a sweep of the 100m butterfly with Norma Yldefonso and Sandra von Giese taking the silver and bronze medals, respectively. In the 4 x 100m freestyle relay, she teamed up with Sonia von Giese , Gertrudes Vito and Nimfa Lim to win the silver medal behind Japan. Following her outstanding performance at the 1954 Asiad, Coloso-Espino was a shoo-in to make the national team to the 1956 Summer Olympics . However, she became pregnant before the meet and had to take a time off from competitive swimming. She was chosen as Woman Swimmer of the Year for three consecutive years (1953, 1954 and 1955) by the Philippine Sportswriters Association . Coloso-Espino resumed her swimming career after giving birth and won four more medals at the 1958 Asian Games in Tokyo . She anchored the victorious 4 x 100m medley relay quartet that included Jocelyn von Giese , Victoria Cagayat and Sandra von Giese . She also won silver medals in the 100m freestyle, 200m freestyle and 4 x 100m freestyle relay along with Victoria Cullen , Corazon Lozada and Gertrudes Lozada . Two years later, Coloso-Espino saw action in the 100m freestyle at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, but did not get past the heats. She capped her swimming career by winning three more medals at the 1962 Asian Games in Jakarta . Retirement After her stint at the 1962 Asiad, Coloso-Espino retired from competitive swimming and became an educator. She briefly resided overseas but returned to her ancestral house in Iloilo to raise her seven children. She taught at the Far Eastern University , her alma mater, Lyceum of the Philippines and Araullo High School . She retired from teaching in 1993. Death On January 16, 2020, Coloso-Espino was admitted at the Medicus Medical Center in Iloilo, due to chronic respiratory infection. She was able to recover from hospitalization but remained frail and asthmatic. Later confined in her residence in Mandurriao in Iloilo City , she died on August 12, 2021, sixteen days before her 84th birthday. Legacy With ten medals (3 gold, 5 silver and 2 bronze medals), Coloso-Espino holds the record for the most number of medals won by a Filipino athlete - male or female - in the Asian Games . She and fellow swimmer Jocelyn von Giese were the first Filipina athletes to win gold medals in the Asian Games . She is one of few Pinays to win at least three gold medals in the quadrennial multi-sport meet, along with sprinter Mona Sulaiman and bowler Bong Coo . In 2016, Coloso-Espino was inducted into the Philippine Sports Hall of Fame as part of the second batch of inductees. She is the first Filipina swimmer to earn the accolade.

{"id": "doc_random_129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Was_the_Week_That_Was", "text": "That Was the Week That Was , informally TWTWTW or TW3 , is a satirical television comedy programme that aired on BBC Television in 1962 and 1963. It was devised, produced, and directed by Ned Sherrin and Jack (aka John) Duncan, and presented by David Frost . The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s, as it broke ground in comedy by lampooning political figures. TW3 was broadcast from Saturday, 24 November 1962 to late December 1963. An American version under the same title aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost. Cast and writers Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall , political commentator Bernard Levin , and actors Lance Percival , who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope , Roy Kinnear , Willie Rushton , Al Mancini , Robert Lang , David Kernan and Millicent Martin . The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song\u00a0\u2013 \"That Was The Week That Was\"\u00a0\u2013 sung by Martin to Ron Grainer 's theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested in one episode with stand-up comedy. Script-writers included John Albery , John Antrobus , John Betjeman , John Bird , Graham Chapman , John Cleese , Peter Cook , Roald Dahl , Robin Grove-White , Richard Ingrams , Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman , Frank Muir , David Nobbs , Denis Norden , Bill Oddie , Dennis Potter , Eric Sykes , Kenneth Tynan , and Keith Waterhouse . Programme 1963 Radio Times cover promotes the return of the programme for a second series. The programme opened with a song (\"That was the week that was, It's over, let it go ...\") sung by Millicent Martin , backed by the resident Dave Lee house band, including guitarist Cedric West . The opening song featured new lyrics each week referring to the news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Some other targets included the monarchy , the British Empire , nuclear deterrence , advertising, public relations and propaganda, capital punishment, sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system , and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include the 12 January 1963 \"consumers' guide to religion\", which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report and led to the Church of England being described a 'best buy'. The programme was not party political but did not treat all issues with what the producers considered to be a false level of impartiality and balance; one example of this is the issue of racism and \"the evils of apartheid \", following the view of BBC Director-General Sir Hugh Greene that the BBC should not be bound by its charter to be impartial on issues of racism, which Greene and the producers of TW3 viewed as \"quite simply wrong\". Following the 1963 murder of 35-year-old white postal worker William Lewis Moore in Alabama, who was on a protest march against segregation in the American South , TW3 's Millicent Martin dressed as Uncle Sam sang a parody of \"I Wanna Go Back to Mississippi\" (\"... where the Mississippi mud/kinda mingles with the blood/of the niggers who are hanging from the branches of the tree ...\") accompanied by minstrel singers in blackface (\"... we hate all the darkies and the Catholics and the Jews / Where we welcome any man / Who is white and strong and belongs to the Ku Klux Klan \"), thus parodying The Black and White Minstrel Show , which was then being shown on the BBC despite accusations of racism over its use of blackface. On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz , and to Francis Crick , James D. Watson , and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called \"Little J. D. Watson\" and \"Who'd have thought he'd ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn't it\". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover the structure of DNA; much younger than the others. TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3 . Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, at the end of each episode Frost read out a brief summary of the plot of the episode of The Third Man that was due to follow the show, spoiling its twists, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of Greene. Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark \"But seriously, he's doing a grand job\". At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: \"That was the week, that was.\" At the end of the final programme he announced: \"That was \u2018That Was The Week That Was\u2019 \u2026that was.\" Kennedy tribute TW3 produced a shortened 20-minute programme with no satire for the edition on Saturday, 23 November 1963, the day after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy . It featured a contribution from Dame Sybil Thorndike and Millicent Martin performing the tribute song \" In the Summer of His Years \" by Herbert Kretzmer . This was screened on NBC the following day, and the soundtrack was released by Decca Records . A clip featuring Roy Kinnear was shown in the David L. Wolper documentary film Four Days in November and on the History Channel 2009 documentary JFK: 3 Shots that Changed America . BBC presenter Richard Dimbleby broadcast the president's funeral from Washington, and he said that the programme was a good expression of the sorrow felt in Britain. Reception Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was initially supportive of the programme, chastising Postmaster General Reginald Bevins for threatening to \"do something about it\". However, the BBC received many complaints from organisations and establishment figures. Lord Aldington , vice-chairman of the Conservative Party, wrote to BBC director-general Hugh Greene that Frost had a hatred of the prime minister which \"he finds impossible to control\". The programme also attracted complaints from the Boy Scout Association about an item questioning the sexuality of its founder Lord Baden-Powell , and from the government of Cyprus which claimed that a joke about their ruler Archbishop Makarios was a \"gross violation of internationally accepted ethics\". Historians have identified TW3 as breaking ground in comedy and broadcasting. Graham McCann said that it challenged the \"convention that television should not acknowledge that it is television; the show made no attempt to hide its cameras, allowed the microphone boom to intrude, and often revealed other nuts and bolts of studio technology.\" This was unusual in the 1960s and gave the programme a modern feel. TW3 also flouted conventions by adopting \"a relaxed attitude to its running time\", and \"it seemed to last just as long as it wanted\". The programme was taken off the air at short notice in December 1963 with the explanation that \"1964 is a General Election year\". Legacy TW3 was broadcast live, but it was normally recorded for legal reasons; only the pilot episode was not recorded. A compilation of material was shown on BBC Four to celebrate the 40th anniversary. The series placed 29th in the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes in 2000. Alternative versions US versions An American version was on NBC from 10 November 1963 to May 1965. The pilot featured Henry Fonda and Henry Morgan , with Mike Nichols and Elaine May as guests, and supporting performers including Gene Hackman . The recurring cast included Frost, Morgan, Buck Henry , Tom Bosley , and Alan Alda , with Nancy Ames singing an opening news-satire-song and Stanley Grover and Ames performing solos and duets. Regularly contributing writers included Gloria Steinem , William F. Brown , Tom Lehrer , and Calvin Trillin . Norman Paris was the musical director. The announcer was Jerry Damon . A running gag was a mock feud with Jack Paar , whose own program followed TW3 on the NBC Friday schedule; Paar repeatedly referred to TW3 as \"Henry Morgan's Amateur Hour\". Of 50 episodes, only a few survive in video form, yet audio episodes survive on acetate disc . The first-season black-and-white episodes were preserved on kinescope film; the surviving colour episodes of the second and final season were recorded in the then-standard two-inch colour quadruplex videotape format. The Paley Center has copies of some seven episodes, including the hour-long pilot. Also, scripts of all shows survive, both in the NBC Collection at the Library of Congress and in the papers of executive producer Leland Hayward at the New York Public Library. Amateur audio recordings of all or nearly all episodes also survive, and an hour-long recording, That Was That Was The Week That Was, a compilation of bits from various shows, was issued on LP and, in 1992, reissued on CD. After the series' cancellation, Lehrer, who did not appear on the show, recorded a collection of his songs used on the show on That Was The Year That Was , released by Reprise Records in September 1965. ABC aired a That Was The Week That Was special on 21 April 1985, hosted by David Frost and Anne Bancroft and featuring future Saturday Night Live cast members Jan Hooks and A. Whitney Brown and puppetry from Spitting Image . Other international versions A Canadian show, This Hour Has Seven Days , aired from 1964 to 1966 on CBC . Although partially inspired by That Was The Week That Was , the Canadian show mixed satirical aspects with more serious journalism. It proved controversial and was cancelled after two seasons amid allegations of political interference. This Hour Has 22 Minutes , created by Newfoundland comic Mary Walsh , has been running since 1992 although the two are not related. An Australian show, The Mavis Bramston Show , aired from 1964 to 1968 on the Seven Network . It grew out of the recent local theatrical tradition of topical satirical revue\u2014most notably the popular revues staged at Sydney's Phillip Street Theatre in the 1950s and 1960s\u2014but it was also strongly influenced by the British satire boom and especially TW3 and Not Only... But Also . The New Zealand show A Week Of It ran from 1977 to 1979, hosted by Ken Ellis, and featuring comedians David McPhail , Peter Rowley and Chris McVeigh and comedian/musicians Jon Gadsby and Annie Whittle . The series lampooned news and politics and featured songs, usually by McPhail and Gadsby, who continued with their own show, McPhail and Gadsby in similar vein. A Dutch version, Zo is het toevallig ook nog 's een keer ( It Just So Happens Once Again ), aired from November 1963 to 1966. It became controversial after the fourth edition, which included a parody of the Lord's Prayer (\"Give us this day our daily television\"). Angry viewers directed their protests especially against the most popular cast member: Mies Bouwman . After receiving several threats to her life she decided to quit the show. The show was praised as well: in 1966 it received the Gouden Televizier-ring, a prestigious audience award\u2014though it turned out afterward that the election was rigged. An Indian version titled The Week That Wasn't was launched and hosted by Cyrus Broacha . In 2004, ABC News revived the iconic TW3 theme song as a closing segment on its weekly magazine program, Primetime Live . Several two-minute episodes aired, but never caught on with the audience. Parodies Cleveland , Ohio, local personality Ghoulardi (played by Ernie Anderson), host of WJW -TV's Shock Theater in the 1960s, ran clips of local celebrities and politicians and satirised them in a Shock Theater segment entitled That Was Weak Wasn't It? Beginning in 2006, 1812 Productions, an all comedy theatre company in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania, has annually performed a stage show called This Is the Week That Is . The variety show style play is written by its small cast with a script that changes nightly over several weeks of performances, and includes improvised comedy, musical parodies, and a versatile cast of performers. The show focuses on politics and news from the preceding year, often taking on local Philadelphia stories as well. In 2019, a documentary, In the Field; Conceiving Satire: The Making of This Is The Week That Is , about the creation of the long-running show was commissioned by the American Theatre Wing and nominated for a Mid-Atlantic Emmy Award for Arts Program/Special.

{"id": "doc_random_130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Plummer", "text": "Earl Ward Plummer (October 30, 1940 \u2013 July 23, 2020) was an American physicist . His main contributions were in surface physics of metals. Plummer was a professor of physics at Louisiana State University , University of Pennsylvania and the University of Tennessee - Knoxville . Biography Plummer received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Lewis & Clark College in 1962 and completed his Ph.D. degree in physics at Cornell University in 1967, working with Prof. Thor Rhodin . His thesis work was on atomic binding of 5-d transition-metal atoms using Field ion microscope (FIM). Plummer accepted a National Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship at the National Bureau of Standards (now called The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)) in the fall of 1967 working with Russ Young, and he stayed as a staff scientist until the fall of 1973. His work included field electron emission and photoemission studies of surfaces. NIST selected his 1969 paper \"Resonance Tunneling of Field-Emitted Electrons Through Adsorbates on Metal Surfaces\", co-authored with J. W. Gadzuk and R. D. Young, for inclusion in the agency's centennial collection of its top 100 articles of the 20th century. This paper reported the first-ever single electron spectroscopy work in which electronic energy levels of atoms at the surface of a metal were observed. In 1973, Plummer accepted a position in the Physics Department at the University of Pennsylvania where his work mainly focused on angle-resolved photoemission , momentum-resolved inelastic electron scattering and nonlinear optical response from surfaces. In 1988, he was appointed the William Smith Professor of Physics and in 1990 became the director of the NSF-funded Materials Research Laboratory (Laboratory for Research on Structure of Matter). In January 1993, Plummer moved to a joint position at The University of Tennessee, Knoxville , and Oak Ridge National Laboratory . His research interests shifted to the study on an atomic scale of phase transitions in reduced dimensionality and surfaces of highly correlated electron systems such as transition-metal oxides . His primary research tool was variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy . In 2000, Plummer became the director of the Tennessee Advanced Materials Laboratory, a state-funded Center of Excellence. Plummer served on many national and international committees both to review existing scientific programs and to identify future directions for science and technology. Recent examples include: Chair of DOE-sponsored Workshop on \"Soft X-Ray Science in the Next Millennium: The Future of Photon-In/Photon-Out Experiments, Pikeville, Tennessee, March 15\u201318, 2000, and Chair of DOE-BESAC (Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee) subpanel for the evaluation of the Intense Pulsed Neutron Source (IPNS) at Argonne National Laboratory and the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) Manuel Lujan Jr. Neutron Scattering Center. He also was a member of the DOE-Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee, 2001\u20132004. He was the author of more than 400 refereed papers and included in the list of the 1,000 Most Cited Physicists, a list compiled by the Institute for Scientific Information which is based on papers published between 1981 and 1997. But what Plummer was proudest of in his long and distinguished career was the mentoring of promising young scientists. This included advising or co-advising Ph.D. theses of 40 graduate students, hosting ~25 postdoctoral fellows, and assisting many young scientists in advancing their careers. He died in Baton Rouge on July 23, 2020. Awards and honors 1968 Wayne B.

{"id": "doc_random_135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrothelium_nigratum", "text": "Astrothelium nigratum is a species of corticolous (bark-dwelling) crustose lichen in the family Trypetheliaceae . It was originally described in 1885 as a variety of Astrothelium minus from specimens collected in Cuba, but was later elevated to full species status. The species is characterised by its distinctive fruiting structures that develop a reddish to saffron-coloured powder before turning almost entirely black at maturity, which gives the species its name meaning 'blackened'. Taxonomy The species was originally introduced by Johannes M\u00fcller Argoviensis in 1885 as Astrothelium minus var. nigratum , based on Cuban material (Wright s.n.; holotype in G, isotype FH-TUCK 3982). M\u00fcller placed the variety in his section for taxa with four-celled spores ( Sporae 4-loculares ) and gave a short Latin diagnosis . He described a thin, smooth, olive-yellow thallus and scattered, small, conical stromata about 0.5\u00a0mm in diameter. These mounds were described as being at first the same color as the thallus, then developing a broad reddish- to saffron-colored powder on the upper surface; the base became paler in places, and the tip opened by a black pore exposing black fruiting tissue. He noted eight hyaline , oblong- ellipsoid spores per ascus , usually in two rows ( biseriate ), each spore four-celled and measuring roughly 20\u201325 \u00d7 8\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm. He distinguished the variety \"\u03b2 nigratum\" by its stromata turning almost entirely black at maturity\u2014hence the epithet nigratum . The taxon was later raised to species rank and combined as Astrothelium nigratum by Andr\u00e9 Aptroot and Robert L\u00fccking ( comb. et stat. nov. ). Description The thallus is corticate (a thin, protective cortex overlies the surface) olive-brown, and smooth to slightly uneven. The spore-bearing structures ( ascomata ) are trypethelioid : each has a single chamber that opens through an apical pore ( ostiole ). They are arranged in diffuse, pseudostroma tic clusters, about 0.2\u20130.3\u00a0mm in diameter, initially immersed in the thallus and then breaking through ( erumpent ); when exposed they appear brown-black. The internal tissue between asci ( hamathecium ) is clear. Each ascus contains eight colorless ( hyaline ) spores that are 3- septate and spindle-to- ellipsoid in outline, measuring roughly 20\u201327 \u00d7 7\u201310\u00a0 \u03bcm ; they do not react with iodine (IKI\u2212). Standard spot tests are negative on both the thallus and the pseudostromata (UV\u2212, K\u2212), and thin-layer chromatography detects no secondary metabolites . Habitat and distribution Astrothelium nigratum has a neotropical distribution. It was previously reported only from Cuba but has also been collected in Puerto Rico ( Maricao State Forest ) and in Guyana . References ^ \"Synonymy. Current Name: Astrothelium nigratum (M\u00fcll.

History Russian Empire Zaporizhzhia Polytechnic National University started in 1900 as a seven-year mechanical technical vocational college, preparing technic-mechanics specialists. Simultaneously with the educational work, the construction of the main premises was carried out. Very quickly the main three-storied building was built. The educational building housed classrooms, physics and mechanical offices, laboratories, an assembly hall, and a store selling ready-made products. By the end of its first decade, 240 students could attend simultaneously. Graduates from the college successfully worked at machine-construction enterprises promoting the rise of the colleges' reputation. It was considered to be one of the best not only in Ukraine, but across Europe. USSR In 1920 the college was reorganized into Zaporizhzhia Industrial Technical School with a four year curriculum. From November 1922 to 1930 the industrial school was the educational enterprise training engineer-mechanics for agricultural machine construction and general machine construction. Many graduates became leading industrial specialists and statesmen. In 1930 the technical school was reorganized into Zaporizhzhya Agricultural Engineering Institute training specialists in four subjects: tractor and agricultural engineering, metal treatment and foundry. In the 10 years before the start of World War II , 782 people got engineering diplomas and worked at Zaporizhzhia plants. During the war, more than 500 students and lecturers went to the front, 52 people studied at the artillery academy named after F.E. Dzerzhinsky , 30 people finished accelerated courses of armored academy. More than 300 students and lecturers were awarded State orders and medals. More than 50 graduates of the technical school did not return from the front. After the liberation of Zaporizhia from German occupation in 1944, the Zaporizhia Automechanic Institute was organized and three years later it became Zaporizhzhia Agricultural Engineering Institute, until 1957 when it was renamed Zaporizhzhia Machine Construction Institute (ZMI). In 1980 ZMI received the Badge of Honor for the preparation of highly qualified professionals. Between 1930-1990 institute prepared 40,000 engineers, including 825 for foreign countries. Ukraine Zaporizhzhia State Technical University was created by a Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine decision dated 20 April 1994. In August 2001, according to Ukrainian President's Decree ZSTU was awarded the status of a National institution. During 2006-2007, separate structural units: Berdyansk machine construction college, Tokmak mechanical school, Zaporizhzhia college of radio electronics, Zaporizhzhia electrotechnical college and Humanitarian college entered the university. Campuses and buildings University campus occupies territory of 14,2 hectares including: Educational zone \u2013 7.8 hectares; Living zone with hostels \u2013 2.25 hectares; Recreation zone \u2013 3.8 hectares; Other \u2013 0.35 hectares. Those territories include 7 educational buildings, sport complex, administrative and business buildings. There are 5 hostels in the university with living space of 25 000 sq.m. ensuring 100% students accommodation. One of the hostels is used for married students\u2019 couples. The main building of the university hosts canteen, assembly hall, editorial and publishing departments, center of computer technologies as well as auditoriums, laboratories, computer classes. There are 43 computer classes governed by faculties and chairs. Computers are also used in many of university's laboratories, where laboratory equipment is combined with computers used for investigations of different algorithms and technologies. Total number of modern computers used for educational purposes equals 1430 units. Wi-Fi technologies are introduced in the university. Besides. University leads Ukrainian high school using NTUU \u201cKPI\u201d cluster. Scientific supervisor of supercomputer calculation center A. Petrenko showed the application of cluster power by different organizations. According to diagram showed in this report in 2009 ZNTU used more than 15 percent processing time of NTUU \u201cKPI\u201d cluster.

In 2008 it won the Young Architect of the Year Award sponsored by Building Design magazine and Autodesk . Background The firm was created in 2008 by Mark Hackett, Alastair Hall and Ian McKnight, and named Hackett Hall McKnight but renamed Hall McKnight after Mark Hackett retired in 2010. Hackett went on to lead the Forum for Alternative Belfast. Rather than aim to create an 'Irish' architecture, Hall McKnight bases its work on what methods and skills the local construction industry can do well. The company's first major public project was the Belfast MAC (Metropolitan Arts Centre), which opened in 2012. The six-storey building, located behind St Anne's Cathedral , includes two performance spaces and a tower clad in black basalt . The Telegraph described it as one of the \"most stunning new British buildings of the century\". Expressing the idea of 'architecture as collage', the Belfast MAC was described by Architectural Review as \"at once pragmatic and ambitious, perhaps even romantic in its trust in material, light, volume and the resolution of detail\". With extensive use of brick inside and out, the MAC won the 2012 Brick Award for Best Public Building. Hall McKnight won an international competition to redesign Copenhagen 's Vartov Square. The square, formerly a carpark, was created with a grove of cherry trees and a variety of seating using concrete and granite. Politiken described the square as over-detailed and \"looking like a liquidation sale for a quarry\". In January 2014 the company won the bid to design a \u00a33.5 million tower to be built in front of the town hall in the centre of Ipswich , Suffolk.

Between 2011 and 2017, he competed for Garmin\u2013Cerv\u00e9lo on the UCI World Tour , cycling's highest road racing category. Early life and education Talansky was born in Manhattan , New York City, and grew up in Key Biscayne, Florida , near Miami . Talansky competed in cross-country running at high school in Florida before taking up competitive cycling at age 17. After success in local amateur races, he moved to Lees\u2013McRae College in Banner Elk, North Carolina , winning the collegiate national championship race in his freshman year. Career In 2009, he left college after one year to join the Amore & Vita\u2013McDonald's team in Italy, but found the conditions unsatisfactory and returned to the US that spring. He raced in the US in 2009 without team support. After a strong ride at the Tour of the Gila race, he joined Garmin for the 2010 season, moving up to the professional team for 2011, where he made the top ten at the 2011 Tour de Romandie . In 2012, Talansky scored his first professional victory in Europe at the Tour de l'Ain , and again rode the Tour de Romandie . This time he finished second overall behind Bradley Wiggins , having finished second to Wiggins on the final stage, a 16.24-kilometre (10.09-mile) individual time trial . Later in the season he was named Garmin's lead rider for the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a , finishing seventh in the general classification. In 2013, he came second in Paris\u2013Nice , having led the race for two days, and was selected for the Tour de France for the first time, again making the top ten overall. He won the 2014 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 , joining a high-quality breakaway group on the final stage to overcome a 39-second deficit to overnight race leader Alberto Contador . He retired from the 2014 Tour de France after a very uncomfortable day on his bike, due to multiple crashes. The broom wagon was following him at the end of the stage. He returned to the Tour de France in 2015 , finishing eleventh overall. The following year he once again contested the Tour de Romandie , but rode in support of Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n and Pierre Rolland . Later in the season, he took fifth-place overall finishes at the Tour de Suisse and the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a . In September 2017 Talansky announced his retirement from competition via an Instagram post. However, the following month he indicated that he had \"un-retired\" and would take up competing in triathlon . He permanently retired from professional endurance sport at the end of the 2019 season after competing in his final Ironman in Chattanooga, TN.

{"id": "doc_random_142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunt", "text": "Not to be confused with Monster Hunter . Monster Hunt ( Chinese : \u6349\u5996\u8bb0 ) is a 2015 mainland Chinese-Hong Kong 3D fantasy action comedy adventure film directed by Raman Hui (in his feature directorial debut). The film was released in China on 16 July 2015 in 3D and IMAX 3D . Upon release, it became a huge commercial success, breaking numerous box office records, including the highest-grossing film in China , before The Mermaid took the crown in 2016. It opened in North America on January 22, 2016 in 2D and 3D by FilmRise . A sequel, Monster Hunt 2 , was released in China in 2018. Plot The film takes place in ancient China , where the Humans existed alongside the Monsters. They once shared the world in peace and harmony until the Humans drove the Monsters out from their home, for they sought total dominion over their lands. Recently, a civil war took place in the Monster Realm which resulted in the usurpation of the Monster King's throne from a treacherous minister, who later sought the Monster Queen and her unborn baby, and the Monster Queen fled to the Human Realm. The story begins with Song Tianyin, an unnerved young village mayor who becomes pregnant with the Monster Queen's baby, and he encounters an aspiring Monster-hunter named Huo Xiaolan, and they both embark on an adventure to protect the baby from villains of the Human and Monster worlds alike. Cast Bai Baihe as Huo Xiaolan Jing Boran as Song Tianyin Jiang Wu as Luo Gang Elaine Jin Wallace Chung as Ge Qianhu Eric Tsang Sandra Ng Tang Wei Yao Chen Yan Ni Bao Jianfeng Wang Yuexin Guo Xiaodong Li Jingjing Cindy Tian Zhang Yuexuan Themes The main theme in Monster Hunt , according to Hui is acceptance (similar to the Shrek series which Hui was involved in). The message in the film is to understand and accept differences, to see the world through others' perspective and to foster more understanding between people and groups. Production Development Raman Hui directed film which is his first live action directorial debut Hui had long wanted to produce a movie in China. In an interview with the South China Morning Post he said that while overseeing sequences for the Gingerbread Man character in Shrek, he daydreamed about animating a character from a Hong Kong bakery, a Pineapple Bun Man. The idea for the film began in 2005 when Hui\u2014who was living in Hollywood at that time\u2014approached producer Bill Kong on the possibility of making an animated movie in China. But Kong who had no experience with animated film turned the proposal down. The two, who had known each other for 20 years, met as Kong used to distribute movies for DreamWorks Animation in China. But about three years later in 2008, Kong, while visiting Hollywood, invited Hui out for drinks on Sunset Boulevard and asked him if he could make a live-action film with computer graphics for him. Hui, who hadn't done any live-action movies simply said, \"Sure, I'll give it a try.\" Kong introduced Hui to Hong Kong writer Alan Yuen to see what they could come up with. They started looking for comic books or other intellectual property to adapt, but to no avail. Alan finished the script alone by the summer of 2009 taking vague inspiration from monsters mentioned in classical Chinese literature, but with an original story. The film is partly influenced by Hollywood movies such as Men in Black , Jurassic Park , and Chinese movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon ; directed by Barry Sonnenfeld , Steven Spielberg and Ang Lee , respectively. The three took inspiration from an old Chinese book \" Classic of Mountains and Seas \" ( Shan Hai Jing ). \"It's a weird book from old China, a bit like Nat Geo [National Geographic] with descriptions of monsters living in the mountains. I kind of based the monsters on the descriptions in that book.\" Hui said. Although Hui admits that there wasn't any particular film he drew inspiration from for the film, he stated that Monster Hunt is partly influenced by various DreamWorks animated movies, Hollywood movies such as Men in Black , Jurassic Park , Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon , The Lord of the Rings film series and Indiana Jones franchise , Hong Kong films like CJ7 and Drunken Master II , works of Steven Spielberg and James Cameron and visual references at once recalling ancient Chinese landscape painting, a 1970s breakfast cereal called Freakies , and the Oddball Art of Mark Ryden . Kong took the first draft of the script to many friends in the film industry and all of the feedback was that it had potential but it would be too tough to make since the film would need visual effects because of its depiction of monsters. Finally, Hui and Yuen went to a Beijing-based visual effects house, Base FX , and made a four-minute test film in 2012. That gave the team confidence to move ahead. Before Hui went to China, DreamWorks Animation sent him to India for 2 years. Upon arriving in China in early 2013, he began assembling his crew, even as he continued to do consulting work for DreamWorks Animation. On the experience of working in a live-action film Hui said, \"It was all new to me. I still recall I was so excited to see a costume being made. Before that, all the Shrek costumes were inside a computer. You can't touch it. For this movie, you could touch the fabric. It was like a toy shop, so exciting.\" Hui and his team decided to make the monsters in the film look more friendly, humanlike and anthropomorphic \u2014in contrary to typical monsters being vicious and scary\u2014because they wanted them to carry emotions and get attached with the audience and the audience to liken the monsters. Filming The forest scenes were shot at the Zhangjiajie National Forest Park in northern Hunan Province The first filming lasted about 85 days, including holidays (over 3 months). Principal photography and production ended in December 2013 and by summer of 2014 the team was working on the special effects which was about 70% done. However, in August of the same year lead actor Kai Ko was arrested in Beijing for drug charges. Hui's initial reaction was that the incident and subsequent arrest of Ko would give him more time to work on the special effects even better. Despite no officials directly ordering the film to be reshot, in fall of the same year, producers Doris Tse and Kong informed Hui of the decision to reshoot 70% of the film with a new actor in place since Chinese authorities were unwilling to show the film with a drug-using headliner anytime soon. Kong admitted that it was a normal business decision and that there wasn't much heroism involved. However, such a massive undertaking would have to cost millions of dollars; they would have to refilm 70% and redo 25% of the special-effects work, call back the cast and crew, find a new leading man and rebuild sets. Hui admitted that he cried after hearing this due to the turmoil he endured. The second filming took almost five weeks (32 days), finishing in late March 2015. Jing Boran , who had starred in one of Kong's other recent films, was so eager to help Kong and Hui that he volunteered to take over Kai Ko's role without collecting a salary. More than 90% of the original crew returned for the reshoots, with many also working for free or at a reduced rate. Every day, as he completed his shots, Hui would edit and send the footage to Base FX so that effects work could start immediately. In addition to redoing all the scenes that had previously contained Ko, Hui and Kong added several new sequences and new roles and cameos for some additional well-known actors, such as Yao Chen to boost the movie's star quotient, Hui initially felt wary and skeptical if the film would find success at the box office. But following the success of Painted Skin: The Resurrection in 2012, it boosted enough confidence that the team moved ahead with production the following year. Post production Post production for Monster Hunt was done almost entirely in Beijing ( pictured ) with a few works also done in Taiwan . The film's visual effects was supervised by Jason H. Snell among others, who previously worked on the visual effects for Pirates of the Caribbean film series , Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince , Elysium and Tomorrowland and others. Base FX in Beijing was responsible for the film's visual effects. According to Christopher Bremble, chief executive of Base FX, his initial reaction about refilming was fear and concern for Kong, who had made a big investment in the project. In total, the film took 7 years to complete. Music Leon Ko composed the incidental music for Monster Hunt . Release In China, Monster Hunt was originally planned to open in February 2015, during the Chinese New Year holiday. However, following the arrest of Kai Ko , much of the film needed reshoots and a subsequent replacement. This led to film's delay release to 16 July 2015. The film was also released in countries like Malaysia and Singapore. As for a United States and Europe release, Hui and Kong were initially skeptical and dubious if the film could find a general audience there since the film was made to aim at Chinese speaking audience. Hui said If they do release it there, they might need to think about making some adjustments. In September 2015, FilmRise acquired the rights to distribute the film in North America and will release the film in early 2016. In the same month, Hui told Forbes about the possibility to dub the film in English since younger audiences would find it difficult to read the subtitles. In December 2015, an English version of the trailer premiered. The film was released in the United States and Canada on January 22, 2016 in 2D and 3D in two versions; the original Mandarin version with English subtitles and an English dubbed version. The film will remain in theaters for a traditional 90 days before becoming available on VOD . It ended its theatrical run in China on September 17, 2015, playing in theaters for 59 days. The film opened in South Korea on November 12, 2015 and was released in 2D format only in contrary to its 3D release in China. Marketing Due to time constraints, the producers of the film were unable to put licensing deals in place which resulted in a loss of potential ancillary revenue. Hui estimates they lost over a few million dollars for failing to procure merchandising right sales. However, due to the sheer popularity of the film, certain pirate companies produced illegal goods inspired by the film such as the character of Wuba which aided the film in its box office success and in a way delivered free marketing for the film. Hui's only concern was the quality of the goods which were poorly designed. Reception Box office Monster Hunt grossed US$382 million China and including revenues from other countries it grossed a total of US$385 million worldwide. According to Hui, the film needed to make US$125\u2013141 million to break-even due to the film's increased budget and marketing for the reshoot. After just two weeks of release Monster Hunt became the highest-grossing Chinese local movie of all time and in September overtook Furious 7 as the highest ever. On Saturday, September 12\u2014on its 58th day after release\u2014it surpassed Furious 7 to become the highest-grossing film in China with 2.428 bn yuan (US$380.99 million) over Furious 7 ' s 2.426B yuan (US$380.67 million). However, that's reflective of market fluctuations over the past few months: when Furious 7 ended its China run in mid-May, the conversion from the yuan came to US$391.2 million. Monster Hunt is the first Chinese film to top the all-time Chinese box office charts in the 21 years since the market re-opened to foreign films. It became the highest-grossing film in China for five months until surpassed by The Mermaid in February 2016, and the highest-grossing IMAX film in China with $27 million until surpassed by Mojin: The Lost Legend in 2016. Before the film's official release on July 16, 2015 the film made US$930,000 in previews, and on its opening day, Thursday, July 16, 2015, it grossed US$27.5 million, setting a new opening-day and single-day record for a Chinese local film, breaking The Monkey King ' s record and a single day IMAX record of $2.7 million on Saturday. The following morning, Hui received a congratulatory phone call from Jeffrey Katzenberg, his former boss at DreamWorks Animation. Through its 4-day opening weekend, it earned a total of US$109 million ( Rentrak reported a Friday-to-Sunday gross of $72 million and $99 million Thursday-to-Sunday) debuting atop the Chinese box office as well as the international box office. IMAX contributed $8.7 million of the opening gross from 216 screens, a new record for a Chinese produced film. Earning US$46 in its second weekend \u2014 US$113 million in its full week from 19 million tickets sold \u2014 it topped both the Chinese as well as the international box office for two consecutive weekends making it a rare occurrence for a non-Hollywood film to top the international box office for more than one weekend. After four consecutive weekends at No. 1 at the Chinese box office, it was finally replaced by Go Away Mr. Tumor in its fifth weekend, another film also starring Bai Baihe . It became the fastest Chinese movie to reach the RMB 1.05 billion ($169 million) milestone, doing so in 8 days. The success of the film has been attributed to several factors, such as positive reaction and word of mouth from audiences, and also due to China's State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) implementation of the \"domestic film protection period\" or the \"mid-summer domestic film protection period\" or simply \"blackout\"; the unofficial session which lasts six to eight week when fewer foreign films are released in Chinese theaters in order to open up more screen time for Chinese movies. In South Korea, the film had a \"modest\" opening at No. 9 with $130,000. In the United States and Canada, it opened with $21,074 from 45 theaters on an average of $468 per theater. It went on to earn a paltry $32,766 after playing in theaters for only a week. The film has been viewed by over 65 million people worldwide. Controversy over box office performance In September 2015, following suspicions raised on the internet by netizens, an article by the Chinese state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) speculated that it achieved the feat of becoming the highest-grossing film in China by artificially boosting its ticket sales. This was followed by an article by the state media accusing the film of inflating its ticket sales. According to the Financial Times , beginning in late August, netizens reported cases of theater scheduling screenings of the film in the middle of the night and multiple showings of the film on the same theater screen scheduled less than 30 minutes apart. Furthermore, in September, CCTV also reported that the company might have exploited the \"public welfare screening\" \u2013 a common practice for Chinese theaters and production companies to offer free tickets to young children, seniors, key workers, police, teachers and the disabled and in the same month it was found that public welfare screenings of the film at three different theaters were completely empty. According to the SARFT , Monster Hunt grossed RMB2.43 billion during its summer theatrical run. Edko, the film's distributor stated that those figures incorporated RMB40.42 million worth of tickets handed out during the final 15 days of release for the film \u2013 an average of RMB2.7 million a day which according to calculations by National Business Daily accounts for virtually all of the film's box office earnings in that period. The company also issued a statement on Chinese social media site Weibo , saying it had \"instituted serious criticism\" to those responsible for the suspect screenings. Critical reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , it has a 64% approval rating, based on 22 reviews, with a rating average of 5.7 out of 10. It has a score of 53% on Metacritic based on 14 reviews. Elizabeth Kerr of The Hollywood Reporter called it \"A would-be epic adventure-fantasy that's epically muddled.\" Edmund Lee of South China Morning Post gave it three out of five stars, and says it is \"a distinctly Chinese live-action debut\", but it \"tackles a litany of clich\u00e9d Chinese attributes and is more engaging as cultural commentary than entertainment.\" Derek Elley of Film Business Asia gave the film a 7 out of 10, calling it a \"well-packaged family entertainment [that] disguises its unoriginality with top CG animation.\" Simon Abrams, writing for Roger Ebert.com , awarded it 2.5 out of 4 stars, saying \"The story never goes anywhere unexpected, but really, you should see \"Monster Hunt\" with your kids. It is silly and over-the-top and a great time-killer.\" The A.V. Club gave a mixed review, saying \"Monster Hunt combines a lot of qualities from the other items on the all-timer\u2019s list: epic action, elaborate special effects, broad comedy, and a style that could best be described as \"exhausting.\"\" Awards and nominations Sequels Main article: Monster Hunt 2 Monster Hunt 2 is a sequel to 2015's Monster Hunt directed by Raman Hui, starring Tony Leung, Bai Baihe, Jing Boran, Li Yuchun and Tony Yang. It was released in China on February 16, 2018. A third film was also announced. In February 2017, Hui and Kong discussed about a fourth film and a potential spin-off. The idea is the turn these films into a franchise, a first time in China and expanding the franchise with sub-licensing agreements, merchandising deals and theme park attractions. Notes ^ The original production budget of the film was US$40 million (excluding marketing, publicity and advertising costs). However, due to reshoots the budget climbed up to about US$56 million.

{"id": "doc_random_146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascual_Boing", "text": "Pascual Boing is a Mexican soft drink maker mostly known for its fruit flavored beverages marketed under the Pascual, Boing! and Lul\u00fa brands. The enterprise was begun in 1940 and successfully held against the entrance of foreign competitors in the Mexican market. However, continued labor disputes led to a strike in 1982, which ended in 1985 with the workers obtaining the right to take over the company, running it as a cooperative . Since then, it has remained a profitable business although it has lost market share in Mexico, due to competition from Coca-Cola and Pepsi . This has prompted the company to protest unfair practices which exclude it from retail venues as well as look abroad to new markets, especially in the United States. it is also one of the sponsors for many Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre and Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide 's shows History The company was originally a private enterprise, started in 1940 by Rafael Victor Jim\u00e9nez Zamudo. In the 1960s, J\u00edm\u00e9nez began using tetra paks and acquired its Northern plant from Canada Dry , along with a franchise to produce and market these products. From its beginnings to the early 1980s, the company had tremendous growth with Jim\u00e9nez very successful in the face of competition from multinational corporations. Two plants were opened in the 1960s. In 1980, the company was fourth in the soft drink market in Mexico. However, the working conditions at the plants were exploitative, with workers obligated to work overtime without pay increases. There had been several attempts to organize workers at the plant due to abuses, but management fired organizers. In March 1982, the Mexican federal government decreed that all workers, including those in private companies, receive thirty percent wage increases because of the devaluation of the peso. However, Jim\u00e9nez refused the increase, stating that he could not afford it. Several political activists organized the workers to protest and as 150 workers were fired for participating, all the workers went on strike on May 18, 1982, shutting down operations. On May 31, Jim\u00e9nez and others confronted the striking workers at the plant in Colonia Tr\u00e1nsito . Violence broke out and two strikers were killed, with seventeen wounded. Jim\u00e9nez was formally accused of murder but was not prosecuted. The work stoppage went on for three years. At one point, workers took over the federal arbitration offices, and a formal committee to represent the workers was formed. They gained legal recognition as well a public support for their cause. In 1983, the courts found in favor of the workers in litigation against the company and in 1984, workers met with President Miguel de la Madrid . Jim\u00e9nez declared the company bankrupt and tried to sell the facilities. However, the workers and federal authorities worked out an arrangement that the workers would take over the company entirely, including facilities and brand. A cooperative called the Sociedad Cooperativa Trabajadores de Pascual S.C.L. was formed on May 27, 1985. After years of being idle, the new worker/owners needed about 1.5 million dollars to restart operations. During the strike, over 320 painters sided with the workers including Rufino Tamayo , David Alfaro Siqueiros , Francisco Toledo , Felipe Ehrenberg , Carolia Paniagua , Jos\u00e9 Ch\u00e1vez Morado , Alfredo Zalce , Guillermo Ceniceros and Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas as well as the Sal\u00f3n de la Pl\u00e1stica Mexicana and Taller de Gr\u00e1fica Popular by donating artworks to auction off. There were two small auctions but the money being raised was not sufficient and the continued selling of the artworks became difficult. Instead, the main union of the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico provided the funds needed to obtain permits and service the machinery. The remaining painting remained with the company and in 1991 an entity called the Fundaci\u00f3n Cultural Trabajadores de Pascual y del Arte, A. C. was created for their care and promotion. The new cooperative has had multiple struggles since it was created. The start of the cooperative was rocky with internal struggles among the workers as to how to organize and operate. However, operations as a cooperative began on November 27, 1985 with workers receiving their first share of profits in May 1986. The former owner, Jim\u00e9nez, lost the legal right to use the name Pascual Boing but nonetheless was doing so from a plant in Aguascalientes until cooperative representative negotiated a deal. Another ongoing problem is that the land on which the original factories are located did not belong to the original company but rather to the owner's wife, Victoria Valdez. She was allowed to sue the cooperative in 1989 and won the case in 2003, with the court ordering Pascual off the land. At this point, then Mexico City mayor Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador , expropriated the land from Valdez to give to Pascual. However, in 2005, the Supreme Court decreed this expropriation to be illegal, since it did not benefit the public but a private company that produced a non-essential product. Pascual does not see itself as a private, for-profit company; they claim that being worker-owned, they perform a social function and as such expropriation in their favor is for public benefit. Since their founding, they have received vocal and political support from the PRD, intellectuals, writers such as Elena Poniatowska , college students and those opposed to globalization . Despite its problems, the cooperative has grown, opening major processing plants in San Juan del R\u00edo, Quer\u00e9taro , in 1992, one in Tizayuca , Hidalgo , in 2003 and another in Culiac\u00e1n, Sinaloa , in 2006. In the 2000s, it has also been working on markets in the United States and elsewhere, eyeing northern areas nearer the border such as Ciudad Acu\u00f1a to facilitate export and in 2011 a freezing and bottling plant was begun in An\u00e1huac, Nuevo Le\u00f3n . Despite its growth, the cooperative has had to rebut assertions that it is going broke. For example, in 2007, the company had to deny a chain email stating that it was on the verge of bankruptcy, and to buy the product to save the company. Today, Pascual Boing is the only remaining wholly Mexican owned major soft drink bottler. The company employs over 5,000 people and generates over 22,000 jobs indirectly, benefitting more than 50,000 families. Part of the enterprise's mission is to show that employee ownership as a cooperative can work. The organization of the cooperative consists of a General Assembly of founders and other partners, followed several boards including Corporate/Investment, Administration, Oversight and the Cultural Foundation. Under these are four commissions called Education, Social Outlook, Arbitration and Technical Control. It is also dedicated to a sense of social responsibility. It has been recognized by the Secretar\u00eda del Trabajo as a \"clean industry\". In 2003, the company partnered with the federal government to circulate information about the prevention or kidnapping of children which included announcements on Pascual Boing trucks and materials for schools. Products and production Boing! drinks produced by Pascual Boing The company sells fruit juice, nectars, concentrates, carbonated beverages, bottled water and milk. It is best known for its fruit flavored drinks such as guava , mango , tamarind , strawberry, apple, pineapple, soursop , grape, lime, grapefruit and peach under the Boing! Lul\u00fa and Pascual brands. Other brands include PulpaMex, Woopy, Leche Pascual, Nectasis and Pascuatin. All of the processing of their products is done by Pascual. Pascual uses real sugar in their products as opposed to fructose although the former is more expensive. It obtains its sugar from the Sociedad Cooperativa Trabajadores del Ingenio Puruar\u00e1n in Michoac\u00e1n , purchasing 100% of the annual production. They also use real fruit such as mangos from Veracruz and Guerrero , strawberries from Guanajuato and apples from Puebla along with natural colorings. The company has nineteen facilities and thirty production lines, capable of producing 120 tons of fruit pulp and 470,970 cases of finished product in three shifts with an annual capacity of fifty million cases of finished product per year. It has two main processing plants: Planta San Juan del R\u00edo in Quer\u00e9taro and Planta Tizayuca in Hidalgo. The Tizayuca plant produces about a billion liters of juice a year and employs about 900 people, working at only sixty percent of capacity. In 2011 the company invested about 25 million pesos to expand the Tizayuca plant. As part of its expansion northward, a smaller plant was built in An\u00e1huac, Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Marketing and distribution Most of Pascuals\u2019 products are marketed on the Boing!, Pascual and Lul\u00fa brands. While its products can be found in all of Mexico, distribution is concentrated in the center and northeast of the country, with the Mexico City area accounting for sixty percent of sales. There are a total of 1048 distribution centers. It has 19 wholly owned distributors along with 27 major independent distributors in Acapulco , Aguascalientes , Mexico City, Ciudad Madero , Cuernavaca , Guadalajara , Iguala , Le\u00f3n , Monterrey , Morelia , Pachuca , Poza Rica , Puebla , Quer\u00e9taro , R\u00edo Blanco , San Luis Potos\u00ed and Toluca . In the center of the country, Pascual products are widely found in smaller grocery stores, restaurants and semi-fixed street stands, which account for about half of its sales. Delivery of products is mostly handled by an outside cooperative of truckers. Pascual Boing is a major exporter of soft drinks in Mexico along with Arca. In 2008, the exported about 1.5 million of the 50 million cases of beverages it produced. It exports to the U.S., Canada, Guatemala , Belize , El Salvador , Costa Rica , Jamaica , Panama and Trinidad and Tobago , with exports to China and South America beginning in 2012. Its largest export market is the United States, concentrated in Texas, Chicago, North Carolina, Florida and California, where it targets the Hispanic market looking for something from home. As of 2011, sales were about 150,000 cases. NAFTA has helped with the lowering of tariffs, making the products more competitive. Pascual Boing began in small Hispanic groceries and is working to expand into major supermarkets but this has been difficult because it does not spend as much on marketing as other soft drink producers. However, the US export market is growing and in the 2000s it began constructing facilities in border areas in order to facilitate export to the United States. Much of the push to develop foreign markets for Pascual Boing products has come from competition inside Mexico from multinational companies. Pascual Boing has accused makers such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi of monopolistic practices aimed at excluding the Mexican bottlers from retail venues such as small groceries, school cafeterias and public events. Pascual Boing used to have a fifty percent share in Mexico but this has shrunk to fifteen percent. Today, Coca-Cola and its bottlers control over 75% of the Mexican soft drink market. Pascual Boing accuses Coca-Cola and Pepsi of making outlets sign exclusivity agreements, so that they cannot sell Pascual products. For example, Pascual is excluded from about twenty percent of school campuses in the state of Hidalgo. In 2010, Pascual workers closed the Mexico City-Pachuca highway to demand that federal and state authorities do something against these tactics. Logo Old logo The company has had a long-standing dispute with Walt Disney over its duck logo, adopted in the 1940s. The logo was based on Donald Duck including a sailors cap and named Pato Pascual (Pascual Duck). This version can still be found in some places. In the 1980s, Disney sued, leading to some minor changes in the logo. In the 2000s, Disney complained again that the logo looked too much like Donald Duck. In 2007, it was changed again, with the current version having a rapper look with ruffled feathers and a baseball cap turned backwards. Fundaci\u00f3n Pascual Works from the permanent collection on display at the Centro de Educaci\u00f3n Continua Unidad Allende IPN During the strike of 1982\u20131985, workers were supported by over 320 artists. After the workers won the right to take over the company, these artists along with the Sal\u00f3n de la Pl\u00e1stica Mexicana and Taller de Gr\u00e1fica Popular began a project to auction donated works to raise the money needed to restart the idle plants. The project gathered 524 works of art. However, most of the donated paintings were not sold for various reasons ending with the obtaining of the needed money from the main union of the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico. The new workers\u2019 cooperative offered to return the works to the artists but most preferred that they remained with the organization. From 1985 to 1991, the collection increased to almost one thousand pieces due to continued donations. In 1991, the cooperative created the Fundaci\u00f3n Cultural de Trabajadores de Pascual to care and promote the collection. The permanent collection mostly contains works by about 400 Mexican and Latin American artists but also some from Spain and Germany, representing about 400 artists, mostly dating from the middle to late 20th century. The collection includes sculptures, canvas works, diptychs , triptychs and more. The collection has been put on display various times such as in the Centro Cultural El Refugio in Tlaquepaque and Espacio del Arte of Televisa .

{"id": "doc_random_147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead_in_Poland", "text": "Mead ( Polish : mi\u00f3d pitny [m\u02b2jut \u02c8p\u02b2itn\u0268] , literally \"drinkable honey \") is an alcoholic beverage within Polish culinary tradition made by alcoholic fermentation of a mixture of honey and water. It has a characteristic honey aroma and a flavour that may be enriched by the addition of fruit juices, herbs or spices. The colour ranges from golden to dark amber, depending on the type of honey used for production. In 2008, four traditional Polish mead grades, which indicate the proportion of honey and water used in production, were registered by the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed . Production of mead in Poland almost doubled within the next four years, making Poland the world's largest producer of mead made according to traditional methods. Grades and varieties Polish meads are traditionally and legally classified into four grades ( czw\u00f3rniak, tr\u00f3jniak, dw\u00f3jniak, p\u00f3\u0142torak ) depending on the ratio of honey and water used in production and the resulting sweetness and alcohol content. Their names come from the total number of parts by volume of honey and water, with one part being honey; for example, czw\u00f3rniak is made from one part honey and three parts water, giving a total of four parts. The lower the total number of parts, the stronger, sweeter and more expensive the mead. Informal honey-to-water proportions, such as p\u00f3\u0142trzeciak (1:1.5) or sze\u015bciak (1:5), may be used in home production, but are not commercially available due to legal restrictions. Mead may be flavoured with fruit juices, producing fruit mead ( mi\u00f3d owocowy ), or with herbs and spices, giving herbal mead ( mi\u00f3d zio\u0142owy ) or spiced mead ( mi\u00f3d korzenny ). Traditional varieties, distinguished according to the raw materials and natural additives used or to the method of ageing, include: agrestniak , flavoured with gooseberry juice; bor\u00f3wczak , flavoured with lingonberry juice ; czere\u015bniak , flavoured with sweet cherry juice ; czerniak , flavoured with bilberry juice; d\u0119bniak , matured in oak barrels; dereniak , flavoured with Cornelian cherry juice; gruszeczniak , flavoured with pear juice; jab\u0142czak , flavoured with apple juice; jarz\u0119biak , flavoured with rowanberry juice; je\u017cyniak , flavoured with blackberry juice; kaliniak , flavoured with guelder rose juice; lipiec , made from linden honey; maliniak , flavoured with raspberry juice; mi\u00f3d chmielowy , flavoured with hops ; mi\u00f3d gronowy , flavoured with grape juice; morwiak , flavoured with mulberry juice; porzeczniak , flavoured with currant juice; poziomczak , flavoured with woodland strawberry juice; \u015bliwniak , flavoured with plum juice; wi\u015bniak , flavoured with sour cherry juice. Other popular flavouring ingredients include celery leaves, cinnamon , cloves , elderberries , ginger , juniper berries , rose oil and vanilla . Production A stoneware bottle and a glass of p\u00f3\u0142torak mead Mead is made by fermentation of must , which is a mixture of honey and water, the proportion of which depends on the required grade. In the cases of dw\u00f3jniak and p\u00f3\u0142torak , the sugar concentration would be too high for the yeast to work in the fermentation process, so the must is prepared with one part honey to two parts water; the rest of the honey is added in the final stage of fermentation or during aging. For fruit meads, at least 30 percent of the water is replaced with fruit juice ; herbs or spices may be added as well. In commercial production, the must is usually boiled at a temperature of 95\u2013105 \u00b0C, giving what is known in Polish as mi\u00f3d sycony (saturated mead). The required extract is obtained in a kettle fitted with a steam jacket. This method of brewing prevents caramelization of the sugars. Mi\u00f3d niesycony (unsaturated mead) is also made, especially in home production, wherein the must is made by mixing honey with room temperature or warm water, without boiling, allowing to retain more of the honey aroma. In order to guarantee the microbiological safety of the boiled must, it is cooled on the same day to 20\u201322 \u00b0C, the optimum temperature for yeast to propagate. A yeast solution is then added to the must in a fermentation tank in a process known as \"pitching\". Violent fermentation takes 6\u201310 days. Keeping the temperature at a maximum level of 28 \u00b0C ensures that the fermentation process runs properly. This is followed by still fermentation, which takes 3\u20136 weeks. At this stage, it is possible to add the remaining quantity of honey to achieve the proportion required for dw\u00f3jniak or p\u00f3\u0142torak . After obtaining an alcohol content of at least 12 percent by volume, the mead undergoes racking prior to aging. Leaving the pitched must on the lees beyond the still fermentation period would adversely affect the mead's organoleptic properties because of yeast autolysis . Aging (maturing) and siphoning ( decantation ) is repeated as necessary to prevent unwanted processes from taking place in the lees. During aging, it is possible to carry out pasteurization and filtration . This stage is essential for ensuring that the product has the right organoleptic properties. The flavor of the final product may be adjusted by adding honey to sweeten the mead, addition of herbs and spices or ethanol of agricultural origin. Bottling takes place at a temperature of 18\u201325 \u00b0C. Traditional carboys , ceramic bottles or oak barrels are typically used. Serving In Poland, mead is most commonly served at room temperature in a glass or a stoneware cup. Depending on the weather, it may be also drunk chilled to about 12\u00b0C or warm. On a hot day, chilled mead may be served with mint or a lemon slice. In winter some Poles enjoy mulled mead, which may be additionally flavoured with cloves, cinnamon, vanilla, ginger, black pepper or a slice of orange . History Early-19th-century Polish noblemen enjoying mead in a painting inspired by Pan Tadeusz . Painted by Wandalin Strza\u0142ecki in 1884. Mead production and consumption in Poland is a tradition that stretches back for centuries. In the Middle Ages, Poland was covered with primeval forests, which the 12th-century chronicler Gallus Anonymus described as \"flowing with honey\". This abundance of honey and a climate ill-suited for grape growing meant that mead was long more popular than wine. In 996, the Sephardi Jewish traveller Ibrahim ibn Yaqub wrote that \"besides food, meat and land for ploughing, the country of Mieszko I abounds in mead, which is what the Slavic wines and intoxicating drinks are called\". In the 15th century, the Venetian diplomat Ambrogio Contarini observed that \"having no wine, [the Poles] make a certain drink out of honey, which intoxicates people much more than wine.\" The 16th-century Polish poet Sebastian Klonowic praised the \"nutritious and healthy\" mead of Ruthenia (then part of Poland, now in western Ukraine) as a \"nectar\" worthy of Olympian gods , as opposed to wine. Wine comes from the earth muddy and grey, Mead must be sent down straight from the heavens. Notwithstanding the popular notion that mead used to be the everyday drink in Poland, it has always been a luxury good, reserved for special occasions, such as weddings, and available only to the affluent, while beer was the daily thirst quencher of the common people. Mead was valuable enough to be deemed a suitable gift for monasteries and dignitaries. The oldest known recipe for mead was recorded in 1567 by the Swedish chronicler Olaus Magnus , who obtained it from a native of the Polish city of Gniezno . According to it, ten pounds of honey were to be boiled with forty pounds of water, flavoured with hops and fermented with beer yeast or bread starter. As well as with hops, 17th-century Polish mead was flavoured with fennel , pepper, cloves, cinnamon, anise , poppy seeds or parsley . Source materials describing Polish culinary traditions of the 17th and 18th centuries contain not only general mentions of mead, but also references to different types of it. The terms czw\u00f3rniak, tr\u00f3jniak, dw\u00f3jniak and p\u00f3\u0142torak date back to this period. Mead was produced and served in meaderies , known in Polish as miodosytnie , which were marked with a red cross above the door to distinguish them from beerhouses, marked with a straw wisp, and from wineshops, marked with a wreath. Around the 17th century mead started to lose popularity to wine imported from the south, especially from Hungary, and domestically produced vodka . In the 19th century it came to be associated with the bygone times of pre- partition Poland, as evidenced by its mentions in the Polish national epic poem Pan Tadeusz by Adam Mickiewicz , in the poems of Tomasz Zan and in the Trilogy of historical novels by Henryk Sienkiewicz . Market In 2008, the four legally recognized grades were registered by the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed under the names czw\u00f3rniak staropolski tradycyjny, tr\u00f3jniak staropolski tradycyjny, dw\u00f3jniak staropolski tradycyjny and p\u00f3\u0142torak staropolski tradycyjny (where staropolski tradycyjny means \"traditional Old Polish\"). Within the next four years the production of mead in Poland almost doubled from 760,000 litres in 2008 to 1.4 million litres in 2013, when Poland became the world's largest producer of mead made with traditional methods. Despite a long-standing tradition of mead consumption, the beverage is a niche product in Poland. In 2013, about 600,000 litres of mead were sold in Poland, compared with 142.5 million litres of wine sold during the same period. Mead amounted to 0.5 percent of total alcohol consumption in Poland in 2013. Only nine percent of adult Poles polled that year declared that they had drunk mead at least once in the last three months; 27 percent said they had enjoyed mead in the last 12 months. Those who drank mead, did so mostly at family or social gatherings. A majority of those who did not, said there had been no occasion for it. Polish mead producers expect little growth of domestic demand, which stood at 8 percent per year in 2013, and focus instead on exports, as demand for Polish mead is growing on external markets at a rate of 15\u201320 percent per year. Mead produced in Poland is exported to Western Europe, Australia, China, Japan, Mexico and the United States.

{"id": "doc_random_148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Adams_Light", "text": "Point Adams Light was a lighthouse near the mouth of the Columbia River on the Oregon Coast of the United States . The lighthouse was designed by Paul J. Pelz , who also designed Point Adams's sister stations, Point Fermin Light in San Pedro, California, East Brother Island Light in Richmond, California, Mare Island Light , in Carquinez Strait, California (demolished in the 1930s), Point Hueneme Light in California (replaced in 1940), and Hereford Inlet Light in North Wildwood, New Jersey, all in essentially the same style. It operated from February 15, 1875, until 1899, when it became obsolete by the extension of the south jetty and the establishment of the Lightship Columbia in 1892. The lighthouse was considered a fire hazard and demolished in 1912. It was located about a mile south of Point Adams \u2014named by Captain Robert Gray in 1792 [1] \u2014near what is now Battery Russell in Fort Stevens State Park . The combination of the Point Adams Light with the Cape Disappointment Lighthouse on the north side of the river effectively framed the entrance to the Columbia. The keeper's quarters and light were a combined structure, similar to the Yaquina Bay Light , in Newport, and used the same structure, materials, and optics as Point Fermin Light south of Los Angeles, California . The light was changed from alternating red and white to fixed red on January 21, 1881, to reduce confusion with the nearby just-completed Tillamook Rock Light . The change caused HMS Fern Glen to run aground, evidently unaware of the change. At the same time, the fog signal was removed: it had long been criticized by mariners as being inaudible over waves crashing on shore. The keeper considered the biggest maintenance problem to be the prevention of sand accumulation at the base of the lighthouse. Fences were unsuccessfully attempted at one point. After decommissioning, the light was replaced by the Desdemona Sands Light in December 1901. It was finally burned down by the Lighthouse Service in 1912.

{"id": "doc_random_149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elongation_factor_2_kinase", "text": "In enzymology , an elongation factor 2 kinase ( EC 2.7.11.20 ) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction : ATP + [elongation factor 2] \u21cc {\\displaystyle \\rightleftharpoons } ADP + [elongation factor 2] phosphate. Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and elongation factor 2 , whereas its two products are adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and elongation factor 2 phosphate. Nomenclature This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring a phosphate group to the sidechain oxygen atom of serine or threonine residues in proteins ( protein-serine/threonine kinases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is \"ATP:[elongation factor 2] phosphotransferase\". Other names in common use include Ca/CaM-kinase III, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase III, CaM kinase III, eEF2 kinase, eEF-2K, eEF2K, EF2K, and STK19. Function The only known physiological substrate of eEF-2K is eEF-2. Phosphorylation of eEF-2 at Thr-56 by eEF-2K leads to inhibition of the elongation phase of protein synthesis. Phosphorylation of Thr-56 is thought to reduce the affinity of eEF-2 for the ribosome, thereby slowing down the overall rate of elongation. However, there is growing evidence to suggest that translation of certain mRNAs is actually increased by phosphorylation of eEF-2 by eEF-2K, especially in a neuronal context. Activation The activity of eEF-2K is dependent on calcium and calmodulin. Activation of eEF-2K proceeds by a sequential two-step mechanism. First, calcium-calmodulin binds with high affinity to activate the kinase domain, triggering rapid autophosphorylation of Thr-348. In the second step, autophosphorylation of Thr-348 leads to a conformational change in the kinase likely supported by the binding of phospho-Thr-348 to an allosteric phosphate binding pocket in the kinase domain. This increases the activity of eEF-2K against its substrate, elongation factor 2. eEF-2K can gain calcium-independent activity through autophosphorylation of Ser-500. However, calmodulin must remain bound to the enzyme for its activity to be sustained. Cancer eEF-2K expression is often upregulated in cancer cells, including breast and pancreatic cancers and promotes cell proliferation, survival, motility/migration, invasion and tumorigenesis.

Taubira studied economics at Panth\u00e9on-Assas University , African American ethnology , sociology at Paris-Sorbonne University and food industry at the French Center for Agricultural Cooperation. Political career Early beginnings Having served as President of the Walwari Party, Taubira from 1993 served as a Deputy to the French National Assembly , being re-elected in 1997 . Non-affiliated in 1993, she then voted in favour of the conservative Prime Minister \u00a0 Edouard Balladur to form a Cabinet of ministers in 1993. Member of the European Parliament, 1994\u20131999 In the 1994 European elections Taubira became a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), being the fourth on the \u00c9nergie Radicale list led by Bernard Tapie . In parliament, she served on the Committee on Development \u00a0(1994\u20131997) and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media (1997\u20131999). In addition to her committee assignments, she was part of the parliament's delegation for relations with the countries of South America. In June 1997 Taubira joined the Socialist Party (PS), and then- Prime Minister Lionel Jospin appointed her to head a government commission into gold mining in Guiana . Career in national politics Taubira was the driving force behind a 21 May 2001 law that recognised the Atlantic slave trade and slavery as a crime against humanity . In 2002 Taubira was a Left Radical Party (PRG) candidate for the Presidency although she did not belong to the Party; she won 2.32% of the votes. After 2002 she became the party's vice-president. She was elected as its Deputy in the 2002 elections and chose to join the Socialists' group in the Assembly. In the Socialist Party's 2011 primaries , Taubira endorsed Arnaud Montebourg as the party's candidate for the 2012 presidential election . In addition to her work in national politics Taubira served as a Regional Councillor of French Guiana from 2010 until 2012. Minister of Justice, 2012\u20132016 Taubira was nominated Minister of Justice by Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault , following the victory of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in the 2012 elections . At the time, she was one of the few black, female politicians within a prominent ministry in the French government. She soon emerged as one of the most outspoken and progressive voices in the government. Taubira was initially supposed to work with Junior Minister Delphine Batho . However, their relationship quickly broke down being unable to share responsibilities. After the June 2012 Legislative elections, Batho was moved to become Minister of Ecology replacing Nicole Bricq , leaving Taubira in charge of the Ministry of Justice. She resigned her position as Minister of Justice on 27 January 2016 after a disagreement with President Hollande over policies related to the treatment of French Nationals convicted of terrorism. In 2013, Taubira voiced her support for land reforms in France's Caribbean territories as compensation for slavery. She also formally implemented an important electoral promise of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and introduced Law 2013-404 , which legalised same-sex marriage in France . In 2014 Taubira successfully defied opposition parties' calls for her to quit after it emerged that she knew former President Nicolas Sarkozy 's phone was being tapped, apparently contradicting an earlier statement from her. She reportedly considered resigning in August 2014, along with other left-wing cabinet members such as Arnaud Montebourg , in protest against Hollande's economic policies. Taubira resigned in January 2016 after openly disagreeing with the French president's proposal to strip French nationality from dual-citizens convicted of terrorism, a measure championed by Hollande in the wake of the terrorist attacks that shook Paris on 13 November ; Minister of the Interior \u00a0 Manuel Valls had taken charge of the constitutional reform draft law, which would normally have been part of her portfolio. One week later, she published Murmures \u00e0 la jeunesse , a book about this proposal. Later career Despite being urged to join the race by supporters, Taubira chose not to run in the Socialist Party's 2017 presidential primary , and remained neutral in the contest; following his nomination Taubira later endorsed Beno\u00eet Hamon \u00a0as the party's candidate for the 2017 French presidential election . In the second round of the presidential election she called on voters to rally behind Emmanuel Macron . Taubira formally announced her candidacy for the 2022 presidential election in January 2022 and won the \" people's primary \" intended to select a consensus left-wing candidate. By March 2022, the Constitutional Council published data showing Taubira had failed to win enough endorsements from elected officials to qualify for the presidential election. Since the end of 2024, Taubira has held the Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio Chair at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil. In this capacity, she participated in COP30 , where she advocated for the preservation of the Amazon rainforest, drawing on the work of the sixty researchers she directs. Political views Immigration Taubira is a vocal critic of illegal immigration to French Guiana . In 2007 Taubira stated that \"We are at an identity turning point. The ethnic Guyanese have become a minority on their own land\" as a result of illegal immigration. In recent years Taubira has called for solidarity with refugees in Metropolitan France . Victim of racist attacks Like other female ministers , Taubira has faced many racist and sexist insults. Taubira allowed the Guyanese political party Walwari to make a direct citation in the Cayenne criminal court against Anne-Sophie Lecl\u00e8re , a candidate for the Front National who in October 2013 shared a racist cartoon comparing Taubira to a monkey on her Facebook page. Lecl\u00e8re was sentenced to nine months in prison and five years of ineligibility by the court before the judgement was quashed on appeal as Walwari's actions were deemed invalid. In September 2016, the Paris criminal court, which had opened an investigation when the facts were revealed, found Lecl\u00e8re guilty of the crime of public insult and sentenced her to a suspended fine of 3,000 euros. In November 2013, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned the comments, which it considered as racist attacks against Taubira, in particular those on the cover of the extreme right-wing weekly Minute , which featured her photo with the caption: \"Clever as a monkey, Taubira finds the banana\". The weekly rejected the accusation of racism, arguing that it merely used two French expressions, \"the second of which - the part about the banana - is familiarly used to describe a person in good shape\". The minister denounced comments of \"extreme violence\", denying her \"belonging to the human race\". The weekly's editor was sentenced to a fine of 10,000 euros for its front page on 30 October 2014. The public prosecutor's office appealed against the fine, saying that it was too lenient. Honours In 2016, Taubira received a honorary doctorate in Laws and Human Rights from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee ( USA ). On 26 September 2016, she was awarded the Sash rank of the Order of the Aztec Eagle by the then president of Mexico, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto . She was awarded an honorary doctorate (dr.h.c.) in Law from the University of Geneva ( Switzerland ) on 9 October 2020. In 2018, Taubira furthermore received an honorary doctorate (DHC) from the Free University of Brussels ( Belgium ) for her defence of diversity as France's Minister of Justice under President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande . Personal life Christiane Taubira at Festival America 2018, in Vincennes . Taubira has been married twice. She has four children with her second husband, Roland Delannon. They are divorced. Delannon is a separatist politician who founded the Decolonization and Social Emancipation Movement ; he was jailed for 18 months for planning to blow up an oil and gas facility in the 1980s.

For the neighborhood of Jaffa and other villages of the same name, see Al-Manshiyya (disambiguation) . Al-Manshiyya ( Arabic : \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0634\u064a\u0629 ) was a Palestinian Arab village in the Tiberias Subdistrict , located 11 kilometres south of Tiberias . It was probably depopulated at the same time as neighbouring Al-'Ubaydiyya , in the 1947\u20131948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine . Manshiyya was located 1\u00a0km south-west of Umm Junieh or Khirbat Umm Juni . History Al-Manshiyya region in historical perspective. Ottoman period In 1799, in the late Ottoman period, Um Junieh was noted as \"ruins\" on the map of Pierre Jacotin . In 1875, Victor Gu\u00e9rin noted Um Junieh as a village. In the PEF 's Survey of Western Palestine in 1881 Umm Junieh was described as having 250 inhabitants, all Muslim. They noted that it was possible that Umm Junieh was the place which Josephus called Union. In the 1880s the land of Khirbat Umm Juni and Al-Manshiyya was bought on behalf of the Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h , the founder of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith . The Arab inhabitants continued to farm the land as tenant farmers . A population list from about 1887 showed that Kiryet Umm Juny had about 330 Muslim inhabitants. Degania In 1905-1907 the land was resold to the Jewish National Fund . What were to become Kibbutz Degania was established at Umm Juni, in part using existing Arab-made mud huts and for a while the Arab village and the Jewish one coexisted. British Mandate era In the 1922 census of Palestine , there were 79 Muslim residents in Khirbat Umm Juneh, while no number is available for Al-Manshiyya. Post 1948 In 1992 the village site was described: \"The site is covered with grasses and a few palm and eucalyptus trees; no traces of buildings remain. The surrounding lands are cultivated by Israelis.\" See also Degania Alef , the \"mother of all kibbutzim \", was established at Umm Junieh in 1909 References ^ Palmer, 1881, p. 136 ^ a b Khalidi, 1992, p. 533 ^ a b c Khalidi, 1992, p. 532 ^ Khalidi, 1992, pp. 533-534 ^ Karmon, 1960, p. 167 Archived 2017-12-01 at the Wayback Machine ^ Gu\u00e9rin, 1880, p. 283 ^ Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p.362 .

Since 2021, he has been Einstein Professor of Global History at Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin . Biography Born in Munich , Goebel studied History at Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin and University College London , where he received his Ph.D. in 2006. He subsequently held a Past & Present Fellowship at the Institute of Historical Research , a Marie Curie Fellowship at the European University Institute , and a John F. Kennedy Memorial Fellowship at Harvard University . After four years as \"Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter\", Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin appointed him as a professor in June 2015. In 2018 he became the holder of the Pierre du Bois Chair Europe and the World at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva. He is one of the founders of the Global Urban History blog and a member of the Graduate School Global Intellectual History at Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin . Goebel's main research interests are the histories of nationalism , of migration , and of cities . Trained in the intellectual history of Latin America , his first book dealt with nationalism and the political use of history in twentieth-century Argentina . However, his second book, Anti-Imperial Metropolis: Interwar Paris and the Seeds of Third World Nationalism , deals with the urban history of Paris as the \u201c\u2018social bedrock\u2019 for the formation of an anti-imperialist consciousness that transformed the world after 1945.\u201d The book won the 2016 Jerry Bentley Prize in World History, awarded by the American Historical Association . Even though the book champions the benefits of \u201cglobal history,\u201d Goebel elsewhere warned that an \u201cover-endearment with phenomena and historical explanations that cross national, and now regional, boundaries (\u2026) can lead to unconvincing historical accounts, or narratives that drown questions of causality in a never-ending assemblage of sparkly anecdotes about \u2018entanglement.\u2019\u201d Original works Anti-Imperial Metropolis: Interwar Paris and the Seeds of Third World Nationalism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2015). edited with Nicola Foote: Immigration and National Identities in Latin America (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2014).

{"id": "doc_random_155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_basil", "text": "Not to be confused with Mrs. Burns' Lemon basil , a cultivar of Ocimum basilicum . Lemon basil , hoary basil , Thai lemon basil , or Lao basil , ( Ocimum \u00d7 africanum ) is a hybrid between basil ( Ocimum basilicum ) and American basil ( Ocimum americanum ). The herb is grown primarily in northeastern Africa and southern Asia for its fragrant lemon scent, and is used in cooking. Lemon basil stems can grow to 20\u201340\u00a0cm (8\u201320\u00a0in) tall. It has white flowers in late summer to early fall. The leaves are similar to basil leaves, but tend to be narrower with slightly serrated edges. Seeds form on the plant after flowering and dry on the plant. Lemon basil is a popular herb in Arab , Indonesian , Filipino , Lao , Malay , Indian , Persian and Thai cuisine . Uses Culinary In Lao cuisine , (where it is called pak i tou , ) lemon basil is used extensively in soups, stews, curries and stir-fried dishes as it is the most commonly used type of basil in Laos. Many Lao stews require the use of lemon basil as no other basil varieties are acceptable as substitutes. The most popular Lao stew called or lam uses lemon basil as a key ingredient. Lemon basil is used much in Indonesian cuisine , where it is called kemangi . It is often eaten raw with salad or lalap (raw vegetables) and accompanied by sambal . Lemon basil is often used to season certain Indonesian dishes, such as curries, soup, stew and steamed or grilled dishes. In Thailand , Lemon basil, called maenglak ( Thai : \u0e41\u0e21\u0e07\u0e25\u0e31\u0e01 ), is one of several types of basil used in Thai cuisine . The leaves are used in certain Thai curries and it is also indispensable for the noodle dish khanom chin nam ya . In the Philippines , where it is called sangig , particularly in Cebu and parts of Mindanao, Lemon basil is used to add flavor to law-uy , which is an assortment of local greens in a vegetable-based soup. The seeds resemble chia seeds after they have been soaked in water and are used in sweet desserts. It is also used in North East part of India state Manipur. In Manipur, it is used in curry like pumpkin, used in singju (a form of salad), and in red or green chilli pickles. The Garo, Khasi and Jaintia tribe of Meghalaya also use it in their cuisine. The Garos call it panet (pronounced phanet). They use it to prepare cold sauce (Ind. Chutney) with added ingredients like fermented fish, chile, onions sometimes roasted tomatoes. In Tripura, it is known as banta , and is used by Tripuri community to make banta mosdeng , a fermented fish-based spicy chutney. In Nigerian cuisine , lemon basil is referred to as partminger or curry leaf, not to be confused with the unrelated curry tree Bergera koenigii cultivated in the Indian subcontinent. Cultivation Lemon basil requires the same care as other basil varieties. It is a tropical plant , that should be in a spot receiving at least six hours of direct sunlight a day. It is actually quite hardy and can sometimes grow continuously given only water, but the flavor will be at risk if not given any fertilizer , chemical or organic. It can really grow in a matter of weeks. It should be watered whenever the topmost part of the soil is dry. At this time, the plant will wilt, but will be back to normal once watered. Basil should never reach flowering during the harvesting periods. If given a chance to flower , its flavor will be sacrificed and the leaves become smaller, dry and leathery. Once the flower clusters form, they should be removed so the plant will continue its vegetative growth. It is, however, a good idea for it to be left to flower and set seeds that will be collected during fall, because the cold winter frosts will kill the basil plant anyway. Harvesting the seeds two weeks before the last frost , and sowing them indoors in the spring will provide next year's harvest. Harvesting once a week for each plant will make it bushy due to the side shoots that will develop. The plant should never be completely defoliated. Propagation is achieved by sowing seeds and from stem cuttings. Seedlings will reach 150\u00a0mm (6\u00a0in) in 3\u20134 weeks and should be harvested at this time to let them branch out. Stem cuttings will gain roots after they have a week of being soaked in water. The setup is simply a Mason jar filled with water and a square of mesh with holes large enough to hold the plant in place while the roots grow. As many cuttings as the gardener wishes can be planted, preferably the most vigorous stems that can be found because they will root faster. The water should be changed every few days. After 2\u20133 weeks, the roots will be long enough for the cuttings to be transplanted into pots or planted in their permanent position to keep in the garden .

{"id": "doc_random_157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/551_Malian_Gulf_earthquake", "text": "The 551 Malian Gulf earthquake took place in the Spring of 551 in the vicinity of the Malian Gulf . It affected the cities of Echinus and Tarphe . Background During the 4th century, an earthquake took place in the Gulf of Corinth . It caused thousands of deaths and reportedly damaged the cities of Chaeronea , Coroneia , Naupactus , and Patras . The city of Corinth itself was probably also damaged, though this in not directly stated in the primary sources. According to the 6th-century historian Procopius , this earthquake created new chasms. They reportedly remained open and \"formed steps\". Transportation between the local settlements became more difficult, with Procopius reporting a requirement of many detours to reach one's destination. A similar deformation of the ground is mentioned by the 5th-century historian Evagrius Scholasticus . Based on their description, the event marked a fault break which extended to the surface of the ground. Main event According to Procopius, in 551 the region of the Malian Gulf was shaken by a new earthquake. The earthquake was then followed by a seismic sea-wave ( tsunami ). There reportedly was a sudden \"influx of the sea\" in the gulf between the regions of Thessaly and Boeotia . The cities of Echinus and Tarphe were flooded by the tsunami, and were immediately \"levelled\". Procopius reports that the islands of the Gulf became reachable to pedestrians , since the sea had abandoned them. But when the sea returned to its proper place, it left behind fish on the ground. There is some doubt on whether Procopius was conflating two different earthquakes, one which took place in the Gulf of Corinth , and another in the Malian Gulf. The geophysicist August Heinrich Sieberg (20th century) considered this to have been a single earthquake, but geophysicist Angelos Galanopoulos (20th century) considered this a description of two earthquakes. The journal Annals of Geophysics considered the second option more likely, because a singular earthquake of that magnitude would have affected more cities. This was likely the same earthquake which Procopius reported as causing a collapse in the fortifications of Thermopylae . Procopius reports that the earthquake coincided in time with a military expedition of the general Narses against the Ostrogoths , dating the event to the final years of the Gothic War . While Procopius connected this earthquake to pre-existing seismic faults, the journal Annals of Geophysics considered another possible cause for it. Submarine landslides within the Malian Gulf may have been triggered by the initial earthquake. The stability of the local slopes was apparently sufficiently disturbed to cause subsequent events, such slumping of the coasts. Surrounding events The year 551 included several other earthquakes in the regions of Greece , Anatolia , and the Middle East . In the city of Botrys (modern Batroun ) a natural harbour was reportedly created this year, due to the collapse of the mountain Lithoprosopos (modern Theoprosopon ). The chronicler John Malalas (6th century) reports the destruction of many ships in the city's vicinity by a large wave, possibly another tsunami.

{"id": "doc_random_159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3d_Antiaircraft_Artillery_Battalion_(Composite)", "text": "The 3d Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion (Composite) (3d AAA Bn (Composite)) was an antiaircraft unit in the United States Marine Corps that served during World War II . The battalion was originally formed in 1943 as the 52d Defense Battalion , one of the first African American units in the Marine Corps. Its original mission was to provide air and coastal defense for advanced naval bases. During the war the battalion served as garrison forces on Roi-Namur , Majuro , and Guam . The battalion returned to Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune , North Carolina after the war. It was the last of the defense battalions before it was re-designated as the 3d Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion in May 1946. The battalion was decommissioned on May 15, 1947. History Organization The 52d Defense Battalion was commissioned on December 15, 1943 at the Montford Point Camp near Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune , North Carolina . It was the last defense battalion commissioned in the Marine Corps. The first 400 men in the battalion came from the 51st Defense Battalion that had been training at Montford Point since August 1942. The technical and leadership experience these men brought with them meant that the 52d did not experience as many of the early growing pains that the 51st did. In February 1944 the battalion moved to the old Civilian Conservation Corps barracks at Camp Knox which was adjacent to Montford Point. While there, they also incorporated the men of the recently decommissioned 7th Separate Pack Howitzer Battery which provided another boost of experienced personnel. During the first half of 1944 the battalion honed its craft at Onslow Beach . Along with all of the other defense battalions in the Marine Corps, the 52d's coastal artillery was removed in order to form additional heavy artillery units for the Fleet Marine Force . The 52d Defense Battalion, along with the 6th and 51st were the only units to retain the moniker of Defense Battalion. All of the others were re-designated Antiaircraft Artillery Battalions. On August 19, 1944 the battalion departed North Carolina for the West Coast. Prior to departure the battalion was reorganized into two similarly organized detachments. It arrived at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton , California on August 24, 1944. Majuro & Roi-Namur Map of Roi-Namur On September 21 the battalion departed the United States embarked upon the USS\u00a0 Winged Arrow \u00a0(AP-170) . Once ashore, the battalion remained divided defending two different atolls from October 1944 through May 1945. One detachment from the battalion arrived at Majuro Airfield , Majuro Atoll on October 17, 1944. They relieved Marines of the 1st Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion that had been stationed their since the island was secured in February 1944. Along with its mission of protecting Marine Aircraft Group 13 's airfield, Marines from the 52d were also tasked with conducting patrols through the nearby islands to search for Japanese activity. The detachment remained at Majuro until March 9, 1945 when it departed on board the USS\u00a0 De Grasse \u00a0(AK-223) . The other half of the battalion sailed for Roi-Namur , Kwajalein Atoll where it disembarked on October 22 and relieved the 15th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion protecting Marine Aircraft Group 31 's airfield. It remained on Roi-Namur until April 28, 1945 when it departed on board the SS\u00a0 George W. Julian . Guam The Majuro detachment arrived at Guam on March 29 and immediately established camp near the village of Barrigada . The Roi-Namur detachment arrived on May 4, 1945. With the battalion reunited on Guam when it took part in garrison duty relieving the 14th Defense Battalion . While on Guam they aggressively patrolled for Japanese stragglers and participated in construction duty. In the summer of 1945, the battalion began preparing for deployment to Okinawa however with the mitigation of the kamikaze threat their orders were changed and they remained on Guam. Knowing they were not deploying to Okinawa had a very deleterious effect on the unit's morale as they came to view themselves as nothing more than an available pool of men for working parties. Gilbert Johnson successfully lobbied his commanding officer to resume aggressive patrolling in order to restore unit morale. Garrison duty on Guam was also difficult because of severe racial discrimination at the hands of white Sailors and Marines. After the War On August 19, 1945, four days after the Japanese surrender , the battalion began transitioning to being a support unit. This became official on September 30 when it was placed under the command of the 5th Service Depot . A detachment from the battalion relieved elements of the 51st Defense Battalion on Eniwetok from October 1945 until January 29, 1945 when it returned on the USS\u00a0 Hyde \u00a0(APA-173) . On February 28, the battalion's Heavy Antiaircraft Group was permanently detached to form the Heavy Antiaircraft Group (Provisional), Saipan . The remainder of the battalion departed Guam on May 13, 1946 on the USS\u00a0 Wakefield \u00a0(AP-21) sailing for San Diego . Arriving on May 26, it discharged some Marines at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and boarded trains for the east coast. The battalion arrived back at MCB Camp Lejeune April 4, 1946 and on May 15, 1946 the battalion was re-designated as the 3d Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion (Composite). The 3d AAA Battalion was not long for the Marine Corps as it was officially decommissioned on May 15, 1947.

{"id": "doc_random_162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benami_Transactions_(Prohibition)_Act,_1988", "text": "Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 (name changed to Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 by section 3 of the 2016 amendment ) is an Act of the Parliament of India that prohibits certain types of financial transactions. The act defines a 'benami' transaction as any transaction in which property is transferred to one person for consideration paid by another person. Such transactions were a feature of the Indian economy , usually relating to the purchase of property (real estate) , and were thought to contribute to the Indian black money problem. The act bans all benami transactions and gives the government the right to recover property held benami without paying any compensation. The act came into force on 5 September 1988. Although benami transactions are now illegal, the act had limited success in curbing them. Updated versions were therefore passed in 2011 and 2016, seeking to more comprehensively enforce the prohibition. Etymology Benami is a Bengali word that means \"without name\" or \"nameless\". In this Act, the word is used to define a transaction in which the real beneficiary is not the one in whose name a property is purchased. As a result, the person in whose name the property is purchased or held is just a mask of the real beneficiary. Background In 1973, the Law Commission of India after studying various Acts and the prevailing benami system, recommended formulating an Act to tackle the issue. Accordingly, the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 was enacted by the Parliament which came into force on 19 May 1988. However, due to various deficiencies in the Act, the rules required for operationalizing the Act were not framed. To address these deficiencies, the Govt of India introduced Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Bill, 2011. Amendments In an attempt to curb black money, in July 2016, the Modi government decided to amend the original act which was subsequently passed by the Parliament of India as \"The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016\". Thereafter, the Government notified the provisions of the act to come into force from 1 November 2016. Mint newspaper reported that the Benami Act along with the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015 , would help the Government in its fight against black money both within and outside the country. The 2016 Act also has safeguard mechanisms such as the adjudicating authority and the appellate mechanism. The act \"prohibits illegal benami transactions, and provides imprisonment up to seven years and fine for violation of the Act which may extend to 25% of the fair market value of the benami property.\" Enforcement Authorities The Act establishes four authorities to conduct inquiries regarding benami transactions: Results On 26 July 2017, the Modi government told the Rajya Sabha that after coming into force from 1 November 2016, properties worth over \u20b9 800 crore (US$122.85 million) were under attachment in more than 400 proxy transaction cases identified so far. Furthermore, the government has set up 24 Benami Prohibition Units (BPUs) across India for taking action under the Benami Act.

{"id": "doc_random_163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_wrench", "text": "Not to be confused with Tube wrench . A pipe wrench is any of several types of wrench that are designed to turn threaded pipe and pipe fittings for assembly (tightening) or disassembly (loosening). The Stillson wrench , or Stillson-pattern wrench , is the usual form of pipe wrench, especially in the US. The Stillson name is that of the original patent holder, who licensed the design to a number of manufacturers; the patent has since expired. A different type of wrench with compound leverage often used on pipes, the plumber wrench , is also called a \"pipe wrench\" in some places. Description The Stillson wrench is an adjustable wrench (spanner) with hardened serrated teeth on its jaws. The hard teeth bite into the softer metal of the round pipe and provide the grip needed to turn a pipe, even against fair resistance. The design of the adjustable jaw, which permits a certain amount of intentional play out of square , allows it to bind on the pipe, with forward pressure on the handle pulling the jaws tighter. On some models, two leaf springs , above and below the knurled adjusting knob, help unlock the jaw when pressure on the handle of the wrench is released. Pipe wrenches are not intended for regular use on hex nuts or other fittings. However, if a hex nut becomes rounded (stripped) so that it cannot be moved by standard wrenches, a pipe wrench can be used to free the bolt or nut, because the pipe wrench is designed to bite into rounded metal surfaces. Pipe wrenches are classified by the length of the handle. They are generally available in sizes from 6 inches (150\u00a0mm) to 48 inches (1,200\u00a0mm) or larger. They are usually made of forged steel . Today, aluminium might be substituted to reduce the weight of the body of the wrench, although the teeth and jaw remain steel. Teeth and jaw kits (which also contain adjustment rings and springs) can be bought to repair broken wrenches. History Three old \u201cStillson-pattern\u201d wrenches (with pencil in photo to show scale) Daniel C. Stillson (1826\u20131899), a mechanic at the Walworth Company, in Cambridge, Massachusetts , created the first such wrench. On October 12, 1869, US patent #95,744 was issued to Stillson. On 17 August 1888, the Swedish inventor Johan Petter Johansson (1853\u20131943) took out his first patent on the adjustable pipe wrench . The Swedish Patent Office issued the patent again in 1894. The idea emerged after he established his company Enk\u00f6pings Mekaniska Verkstad . Back then, nut dimensions were poorly standardized, so each time a tradesman was out on a job, he needed a trolley to take a set of fixed pipe wrenches with him. Johansson's tool could grip nuts of different dimensions. Pipe wrench in different countries In South Africa , the terms \"bobbejaan spanner\" and \"baboon spanner\" are commonly used, especially for large pipe wrenches. Bobbejaan is the Afrikaans term for a baboon . In Spain and Morocco , they are called grifa . In Mexico they are known and called \"stillson\" without even using the word llave (\"wrench\"). In Turkey they are known as \"English Keys\".

SaferNet is a Brazilian non-governmental organization that combats Internet crime in partnership with the Federal Public Ministry . SaferNet fights for online human rights, with a strong focus on combating digital pedophilia , fascism and brazilian electoral disinformation. It facilitates anonymous reporting and provides information and training about Internet safety and security. Safernet operates in three strategic arms simultaneously: the National Center for the Denouncement of Cyber Crimes (hotline), the National Guidance Channel on Internet Security and Brazil helpline, and the actions of Education in digital citizenship. Safernet facilitates anonymous reporting of crimes, with extra consideration for preventing and investigating child pornography , identity theft and various hate crimes . It also works with the government to improve legislation for Internet-related crimes. Safernet also educates, trains, and mobilizes the public on issues relating to their rights and safety. History In 2006, Safernet and the Federal Public Ministry brought a suit against Google 's Brazilian business unit alleging that Google was not policing Orkut pages enough to prevent pornography and hate crimes. Complying with the judge's ruling, Google provided the requested user information to the brazilian authorities. SaferNet CEO Thiago Tavares fled Brazil , going into voluntary exile in Germany , after facing threats, having an employee kidnapped, a family member attacked (hospitalized after suffering a head injury), and discovering he was infected with NSO Group 's Pegasus spyware . The SaferNet CEO realized it was time to move to another country when a family member was attacked and ended up in intensive care, and also when he discovered his computer was infected with NSO Group 's Pegasus spyware , a tool used by authoritarian governments to spy on journalists, activists, and opposition politicians, as well as their friends and family. Pegasus is a spyware developed by the NSO Group , an Israeli company, that can secretly infect mobile devices, allowing access to data such as messages, passwords, and location, capable of stealing files, photos, videos, and messages stored on devices, as well as transmitting browsing history, location, microphone, and camera data in real time. It works by exploiting flaws in systems, such as a phone's operating system, to gain control of the device and collect information from various messaging and social media apps.

{"id": "doc_random_165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Pendarvis", "text": "Albert Pendarvis , commonly known as The Old Trailblazer , is an American Christian radio broadcaster. Radio Missions Pendarvis is the pastor of Radio Missions, a ministry formerly based in Algiers, New Orleans , United States. The founder of this ministry was L. R. Shelton Sr. ; Pendarvis is the fifth pastor of the work. The overall ministry is named Radio Missions. The church itself is called the First Baptist Church of Algiers. The church formerly met in the Metropolitan Tabernacle , a former vaudeville theater in Algiers. Two international radio broadcasts (in America, Northern Ireland, and now shortwave) originate from the ministry: the Voice of Truth (a weekly 30-minute broadcast of Shelton Sr.'s messages) and the Old Trailblazer (a weekday 15-minute broadcast by Pendarvis). The local church broadcasts its two Sunday morning services, the Bible School of the Air and the Worship Hour , on WVOG in New Orleans and all of its services on the internet. The radio broadcasts produced by the ministry are heard on over 130 radio stations. In addition, the ministry operates in several other areas, including a bookstore called the Radio Bible and Bookroom, which sells Bibles and Christian books and the Old Puritan Press, which produces printed materials. The ministry also publishes a quarterly magazine, The Voice of Truth . In 2005, Hurricane Katrina destroyed Radio Missions' facilities in Algiers, and the ministry relocated to their chapel in Baton Rouge , near Pendarvis' home. The ministry did not miss any broadcast of their radio programs or church services during this transition. Doctrinal position The Radio Missions Ministry is Calvinist in their Theology; and while they are not part of any denomination, the ministry believes the London Baptist Confession and they are Reformed Baptists on the order of Charles Spurgeon or Arthur Pink . The books sold by the ministry are predominantly from this point of view. The Ministry is strongly dispensationalist in its eschatology , and has numerous teaching series by Pendarvis and his predecessor Shelton available which discuss the Book of Revelation from this perspective. Similarly, the Ministry teaches the premillennial view of eschatology. (The Ministry bookstore sells the Scofield Reference Bible and speakers reference it occasionally.) The primary emphasis of the Ministry is on \"awakening\" sinners, that is showing mankind its sinful condition (the total depravity doctrine), and pointing to Christ the Remedy for those who are convicted of their need (or awakened ) and fully see their lost and helpless condition before God, showing their only hope is found in Jesus Christ. Almost every message sent out by the ministry stresses this in some way or other. The reason for this is their primary belief that, through shallow evangelism, many people have slipped into the Christian profession without conviction, knowing neither new birth nor repentance nor true faith in the Crucified Saviour. Radio Missions claims to be one of the few strictly Calvinist voices in religious broadcasting . Mission places Radio Missions has several small groups which meet in \"mission places\" (as they call them) for services. These are scattered throughout the immediate area of New Orleans, including Texas, Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. Pastor Pendarvis personally visits these mission places periodically to preach and has several lay pastors who visit these missions. Fellowship Day Radio Missions has a Fellowship Day in both the spring and fall where local church members and listeners to their broadcasts from across the Nation meet for fellowship, food, singing, and services. Until 2005, when Katrina forced a relocation, this was held at the church in Algiers, New Orleans. Recent Fellowship Day meetings have been held at the Baton Rouge facility. Typically, these meetings have extra services which are broadcast over the Internet. King James Only advocacy King James Only advocacy is not a major emphasis of the Radio Missions Ministry, but the Old Trailblazer radio program frequently touches upon this topic. The Radio Bible and Book Room sells many books and audio presentations by King James Only advocates. The bookstore sells only the King James Bible text, and no other version. In fact, Albert Pendarvis has stated that the King James Version is the \"only verbally inspired\" translation available today. The Old Trailblazer broadcast featured a lengthy series of messages on the so-called \"Anti-Christ Bible\" (the Revised Standard Version ), based on notes by L. R. Shelton Sr. References ^ Information about this is available on the Radio Missions web site. ^ See L.R. Shelton's printed sermons on Calvinism on the Radio Missions web site. ^ A complete list is available on the ministry's web site. ^ The Anti-Christ Bible messages are not currently available online, but can be purchased from the Ministry.

{"id": "doc_random_166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine-generated_data", "text": "Machine-generated data is information automatically generated by a computer process , application , or other mechanism without the active intervention of a human. While the term dates back over fifty years, there is some current indecision as to the scope of the term. Monash Research's Curt Monash defines it as \"data that was produced entirely by machines OR data that is more about observing humans than recording their choices.\" Meanwhile, Daniel Abadi, CS Professor at Yale , proposes a narrower definition, \"Machine-generated data is data that is generated as a result of a decision of an independent computational agent or a measurement of an event that is not caused by a human action.\" Regardless of definition differences, both exclude data manually entered by a person. Machine-generated data crosses all industry sectors . Often and increasingly, humans are unaware their actions are generating the data. Relevance Machine-generated data has no single form; rather, the type, format, metadata , and frequency respond to some particular business purpose. Machines often create it on a defined time schedule or in response to a state change, action, transaction, or other event. Since the event is historical, the data is not prone to be updated or modified. Partly because of this quality, the U.S. court systems consider machine-generated data as highly reliable. Machine-generated data is the lifeblood of the Internet of Things (IoT). Growth In 2009, Gartner published that data will grow by 650% over the following five years. Most of the growth in data is the byproduct of machine-generated data. IDC estimated that in 2020, there will be 26 times more connected things than people. Wikibon issued a forecast of $514 billion to be spent on the Industrial Internet in 2020. Processing Given the fairly static yet voluminous nature of machine-generated data, data owners rely on highly scalable tools to process and analyze the resulting dataset . Almost all machine-generated data is unstructured but then derived into a common structure. Typically, these derived structures contain many data points /columns. With these data points, the challenge lies mostly with analyzing the data. Given high performance requirements along with large data sizes, traditional database indexing and partitioning limits the size and history of the dataset for processing. Alternative approaches exist with columnar databases as only particular \"columns\" of the dataset would be accessed during particular analysis.

Their goal was to create a contract brewing company that provides larger capacity production services to a multitude of emerging Michigan beer brands . The venture started with $8 million of private capital, which allowed the company to build a facility in Detroit's historic Corktown district . As part of its commitment to investing in Detroit, the venture donated 2% of its equity ownership to the New Common School Foundation which raises scholarship funds for the city's Cornerstone Schools . Brew Detroit launched brewing and packaging operations at its Corktown facility in early 2014. It later opened a tasting room and retail shop in November 2015. Its initial brewing customers included four Michigan brands: Atwater Brewery , BADASS American Lager , Motor City Brewing Works , and Big Red Beverages . Stroh's was added to its brewing clientele in 2016 when it obtained approval to brew a Bohemian-style pilsner based on Stroh's original formula. On January 31, 2025, Brew Detroit closed its taproom. On February 17, 2025, they announced that they were acquired by Benchmark Beverage Company out of Livonia , who in December 2024 had also acquired Dark Horse Brewing Company and ROAK Brewing Company in Marshall . The company stated that they will brew five of Brew Detroit's flagship beers at the Marshall brewery, and they will be available on tap there alongside beers from Dark Horse and ROAK.

Life and career Kimmel was born Susan Elizabeth Jarvis (\"Betsy\") in New Castle, Indiana , and was raised in Mooreland, Indiana , the focus of her bestselling memoir, A Girl Named Zippy: Growing up Small in Mooreland, Indiana (2001). The book is written from the perspective of Kimmel as a young girl, and in it she sheds light on the townspeople of Mooreland living there in the 1960s and 1970s during the author's childhood. The name of the memoir stems from the nickname her father had for her growing up; however, Kimmel does not publicly share her real given name, which she changed to Haven Skye at age 18 after Kentucky folk singer Haven Hughes. Her second memoir, She Got Up Off the Couch, and Other Heroic Acts from Mooreland, Indiana, is more history of her childhood, but it also tells the story of her mother, Delonda, who decided to return to college in her middle-age years to eventually become a teacher. Kimmel states she never had the desire to become a writer when she grew up, but by the time she was 21, she says she had \"given her life over to poetry,\" which she would go on to write for the next 15 years. Kimmel earned her undergraduate degree in English and creative writing from Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana and a graduate degree from North Carolina State University , where she studied with novelist Lee Smith . She also attended seminary at the Earlham School of Religion in Richmond, Indiana . She lives in Durham, North Carolina , has been married three times and has three children (Kat, Obadiah and Augusten- named after American writer Augusten Burroughs ). Kimmel was a poet prior to writing the memoir of her early childhood. The Solace of Leaving Early (2002) and Something Rising (Light and Swift) (2004) are the first two novels in Kimmel's \"trilogy of place\" about fictional Hopwood County, Indiana. The third book, released in September 2007, is titled The Used World . Her other works include a second memoir, She Got Up Off the Couch (2005), a poetic children's book, Orville: A Dog Story (2003), and a retelling of the Book of Revelation in Killing the Buddha: A Heretic's Bible (2004), edited by Peter Manseau and Jeff Sharlet ( ISBN \u00a0 0-7432-3276-3 ). Her most recent published works include a children's book, Kaline Klattermaster's Tree House (2008), and the novel Iodine (2008), a psychological tale about a young woman with dark secrets.

In 1999, Halliwell launched her solo career and released her debut album Schizophonic , with the lead single \" Look at Me \", produced by Absolute . \"Look at Me\" would go on to sell over one million copies worldwide followed by further number ones at the UK Singles Chart \" Mi Chico Latino \", \" Lift Me Up \" and \" Bag It Up \". \"Look at Me\" was released to radio in the United States in late 1999, receiving limited airplay. With only a radio single, Schizophonic debuted at number forty-two on the Billboard 200 before dropping out within the next month. The album was eventually certified Gold , distributing over 500,000 copies. \"Mi Chico Latino\" did not have a big impact on American radio, and no further singles from Schizophonic or albums were released in the United States. In 2001, Halliwell followed up with her second album, Scream If You Wanna Go Faster . It also included her cover version of the Weather Girls ' 1983 hit, \" It's Raining Men \", used on the Bridget Jones's Diary film soundtrack . The song also won her the International Song of the Year award at the 2002 NRJ Music Awards . The singles that followed, \" Scream If You Wanna Go Faster \" and \" Calling \", reached, respectively, number eight and number seven in the United Kingdom. Halliwell released a special French edition of the single, entitled \" Au Nom de L'amour \". In late 2004, Halliwell made a return to music with the single \" Ride It \", which reached number four in the United Kingdom and number one on the dance chart. However, several months elapsed before another single was released, during which time she was apparently instructed to record some new tracks for the as yet unreleased album by her record company, which was unhappy with the set list. The second single, \" Desire \", was released on 30 May 2005, reaching number 22 in the UK Singles Chart and number one on the UK Dance Chart. Released shortly after, the album Passion similarly received little attention from the public or critics, and stalled at number 41 on the UK Albums Chart. Halliwell's recording contract with EMI was subsequently not renewed, and in interviews Halliwell stated that she was not interested in recording another album at that time. In February 2012, Halliwell confirmed she had been in the studio recording her fourth album since early 2011, and was nearly finished the collection. In 2012, Halliwell premiered a new single \"Phenomenal Woman\". A new album was expected for release in late 2013, but did ultimately not surface despite the release of another new song entitled \" Half of Me \", which was released in Australia.

In 2006, an analysis by the United Nations indicates an approximate median of 300 police officers per 100,000 inhabitants. Only nine countries disclosed values lower than 100 officers per 100,000 inhabitants. The highest median of police officers \u2013 around 400 \u2013 was observed in West Asia , Eastern and Southern Europe . The median of police officers per population remained stable between 2002 and 2006, after an increase between 1995 and 2002. ^ Excluding zones not under the control of the Republic of Cyprus . ^ It is the actual strength, not the sanctioned strength. The sanctioned police force is 2,755,274, which gives a ratio of 197.44 per 100,000 population. The figures include civil police and armed police personnel. ^ Does not include the Security Corps , an auxiliary force. ^ Does not include Tristan da Cunha . ^ Includes the Civil Police (traffic), the Gendarmerie (criminal), and the Fortress Guard (customs). ^ Includes both the Vanuatu Police Force , and the paramilitary wing, the Vanuatu Mobile Force .

{"id": "doc_random_177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Kind_of_an_American_Are_You%3F", "text": "\" What Kind of an American Are You? \", also known as \" What Kind of American Are You? \", is a World War I era song released in 1917. Albert Von Tilzer composed the music. Lew Brown and Charles R. McCarron wrote the lyrics. The song was published by Broadway Music Co. of New York, New York . On the cover is a gray drawing of Uncle Sam pointing. A map of the United States is featured on the lower half of the cover. The song was written for voice and piano. The sheet music can be found at the Pritzker Military Museum & Library . Analysis The song urges Americans (specifically immigrants ) to use this war to prove their loyalty to the United States; whether that may be by fighting or by simply standing behind the US's actions. For those who show no support, this question is posed: \"What are you doing over here?\" It upholds the \" us-against-them \" mentality; the \"them\" in this case is Germany. The chorus is as follows: What kind of an American are you? It's time to show what you intend to do If they trample on Old Glory will you think that they are right, Or will you stand behind your land and fight with all your might? What kind of an American are you? That's a question you'll have to answer to If the Star Spangled Banner don't make you stand and cheer, Then what are you doing over here?

It oversees National Social Security Authority . Overview The Ministry of Labour and Social Services (MoLSS) is the arm of government with statutory responsibility for the protection of vulnerable populations in Zimbabwe. It has two main Departments namely, the Department of Labour and the Department Social Services, which both consist of several divisions. The Department of Labour deals with Labour related issues through its divisions which are the labour relations division, labour research & economics division, international relations division, registration process division and the national employment services division. The Department of Social Services (DSS), which is the main focal point of the assignment, is responsible for finance and administration, rehabilitation, family and child welfare, and policy and programming. DSS, like many other government departments, was enormously affected by the economic decline, caused by the high Inflation rate which had peaked to 231 million per cent, characterized by high prices and unemployment which left 1.5 million households in poverty, homes to some 3.5 million children. As economic growth declined in Zimbabwe, so did the labour absorptive capacity of the economy such that by 2004, four out of every five jobs in Zimbabwe were informalised , resulting in massive decent work deficits. Unemployment rates had remained below 10 per cent between 1982 and 2004. However, during the same period there was a decline in formal employment (from 1.1 million in 1993 to 990,000 in 2002), and a corresponding increase in informal employment. The high unemployment rate led to a lack of professional expertise in different organisations following the exodus of qualified social workers as well as other professionals in search of greener pastures in neighbouring countries and abroad. Over 70% people migrating to South Africa , had an economic purpose for migrating. Ministry of Public Service The Ministry of Public Service was a government ministry , responsible for parastatals (state-owned enterprises) in Zimbabwe . Among other agencies, it oversaw the Zimbabwean Public Service Commission and the National Social Security Authority (NSSA). Around 2014 the Ministry of Public Service was merged with the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (aka Ministry of Labour, Manpower Planning, and Social Welfare), creating the new Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare . Ministerial staff In 2009, the incumbent minister was Elphas Mukonoweshuro and the deputy minister was Andrew Langa .

{"id": "doc_random_181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Rogers_(politician)", "text": "Peter Standing Rogers (2 January 1940 \u2013 6 January 2025) was a Welsh politician, farmer and magistrate who was a Member of the Welsh Assembly (AM) for the North Wales Region from 1999 to 2003, representing the Welsh Conservative Party , and an Isle of Anglesey County Councillor from 2004 to 2022 - as an independent from 2005 onward. Rogers left the Assembly in 2003, after being placed 7th on the Welsh Conservatives' North Wales regional list. He subsequently sought selection as the candidate for Ynys M\u00f4n in the 2005 general election , but left the Welsh Conservatives in 2005 after a protracted and disrupted selection contest. He would go on to seek election to both the UK Parliament and National Assembly for Wales as an independent. Background Peter Standing Rogers was born on 2 January 1940 in Wrexham , Wales. He was raised in Birkenhead , England , where he attended Prenton Secondary School . He later studied at the Cheshire School of Agriculture , where he received a credit certificate in agriculture . Rogers died in Ysbyty Gwynedd , Bangor on 6 January 2025, at the age of 85. Political career National Assembly for Wales (1999\u20132003) Rogers was Vice President of the Ynys M\u00f4n Conservative Association. He ran in the 1999 National Assembly for Wales election for the Ynys Mon constituency and in third place on the North Wales list. He was elected to represent North Wales in the First Assembly. He was appointed by Rod Richards to be the Welsh Conservatives' Environment spokesman shortly after he was elected. After Nick Bourne took the lead of the party he was appointed as the Agriculture and Rural Affairs spokesperson in his frontbench team. He held this role until he lost his seat at the 2003 Assembly election . As Agriculture and Rural Affairs spokesperson, he supported repealing the ban on beef on the bone, and was opposed to bans on fox hunting . In 2000, Rogers called for a debate on an attempted fox hunting ban in Westminster, despite the assembly having no responsibility over the matter at the time, and also called for a ban on French beef. He also led the Welsh Conservative response to the spread of foot-and-mouth disease to Wales in 2001 and tuberculosis in 2002. Three of his own farms were located in the initial foot and mouth exclusion zone in Ynys M\u00f4n, and his cattle were eventually culled. He was critical of the communication around the National Assembly's response to the disease. In October 2001, it was announced he was investigated by standards authorities in the National Assembly for Wales for naming a civil servant, who he accused of failing to adequately handle a constituent's situation. The investigation was passed to the Assembly's Standards of Conduct Committee, which censured him in January 2002. He alleged that the complaint was \"being used politically and was an attempt to keep [him] quiet during the foot-and-mouth crisis,\" but that what he had done was inappropriate. In the same month, Ieuan Wyn Jones , leader of Plaid Cymru, threatened to sue Rogers, after he claimed that Jones was intending to resign his seat in the Ynys Mon constituency and contest the Caernarfon constituency instead. The threat was withdrawn the next day, although Jones did pursue action within the assembly with presiding officer Dafydd Elis-Thomas . The Presiding Officer chose not to proceed with the complaint. Rogers was selected to contest the Ynys Mon constituency again at the 2003 National Assembly for Wales election in March 2002. He was also placed seventh on the North Wales regional list for the Conservative Party , after a local association member's vote to select the order. Rogers said he was \"shellshocked and wounded\" to discover his placement on the list. During the campaign, he was barred from a campaign event, after having to be held back to prevent an altercation between himself and the area Liberal Democrat candidate at a hustings hosted by the Federation of Small Businesses . He was not re-elected to represent North Wales, nor elected to represent Ynys M\u00f4n. However, he increased his share of the vote in Ynys M\u00f4n by 9.2%, coming second with 38.5% of the vote, 2,255 votes behind Plaid Cymru leader Ieuan Wyn Jones . Deselection and selection controversies There was an attempt to select Rogers for the Ynys M\u00f4n constituency for the 2005 United Kingdom general election , but it was unsuccessful, with his application to be on the short list being rejected by the Conservative Party. However, the selection process failed after disruption from supporters of Rogers in December 2003. A second selection process beginning in January 2004 also failed to nominate, with two candidates not attending the eventual selection meeting, and protest from supporters of Rogers. A motion of no confidence in Anglesey Conservative association was passed at the meeting. Members had been threatened with expulsion if the process was disrupted again. Rogers was refused entry to the Welsh Conservative party conference in 2004. In December 2004, James Roach was selected as the Conservative candidate for the seat. Ynys M\u00f4n electoral contests as an independent In February 2005, he announced he would run as an independent candidate for Ynys M\u00f4n at the 2005 general election, and resigned from the Conservative party. Rogers came third, receiving 14.7% of the vote, and defeating Conservative candidate James Roach. He stood for Ynys M\u00f4n at the 2007 Welsh Assembly election , and came second, with 23.3% of the vote. He also stood again at the 2010 United Kingdom general election , dropping to fifth place and receiving 6.5% of the vote. He had been approached to contest the election as a UKIP candidate, but refused. Local government Rogers announced he would contest Rhosyr ward on Ynys Mon council as an independent at elections held in June 2004. He was successfully elected. His re-election in 2008 was uncontested. He served as High Sheriff of Gwynedd from 2008 to 2009 and represented Isle of Anglesey council on North Wales Police Authority. Rhosyr ward was abolished for the 2013 council elections, and Rogers moved to the Bro Aberffraw ward, which he was elected to represent in 2013 and 2017. He was not re-elected in 2022. Suspensions and allegations against the council In 2011, Rogers was cleared of bullying and harassment in 2011, after an April 2010 incident where he accompanied a constituent to the police station, and acted in a manner that was found to have brought Anglesey council and the office of councillor into disrepute. In December 2014, he refused to attend council meetings, claiming he was deliberately being sent Welsh-only correspondence, which he could not read. In 2015, Rogers was suspended from the council for 3 months. He had been being investigated over a 2013 incident, in which he made efforts to speed up the sale of land, where he had a \"close, personal association\" to one of the involved parties, and \"misused his position\" to gain advantage for the buyer of the land. He was cleared of having a prejudicial interest in the sale of some land by the council, but was regardless suspended for a month for his criticism of the Public Service Ombudsman and the officer responsible for investigating him. He appealed his one-month suspension, and attempted to escalate the matter to Local Government Minister Julie James and First Minister Carwyn Jones . His appeal hearing recommended his suspension be increased to 3 months. Death Rogers was admitted to Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor on 2 January 2025. He died on 6 January, aged 86.

It was formed in September 2016 by a group of passengers, disaffected by Govia Thameslink Railway 's service on the Southern routes of the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise, after months of delays, cancellations, overcrowded conditions, and strikes. In 2016, lawyers for ABC launched legal action against the UK Department for Transport for decisions made by the government in their handling of Govia 's train service. The Department for Transport refused to release documents relating to Southern's franchise agreement, including information about a remedial plan agreed with Govia in February 2016. Stephen Joseph, executive director of Campaign for Better Transport , believes that ABC represents \"a new type of passenger lobby group organised by young professionals who are adept at using social media.\" History The Association of British Commuters was formed in September 2016 by a group of passengers, disaffected by Govia Thameslink Railway 's service on the Southern routes of the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise, after months of delays, cancellations, overcrowded conditions, and strikes. It was formed by Summer Dean, a freelance photographer, Emily Yates, who works in journalism and public relations, and others. Lawyers for the Association of British Commuters are launching a judicial review of decisions made by the UK Department for Transport and Govia into the government\u2019s handling of the train service. ABC held a crowdfunding campaign in September and October 2016, raising over \u00a326,000, donated by more than 1,300 people. In December 2016 the association organised a large demonstration at Victoria Station in the face of continuing strikes on London Transport, demanding the resignation of Transport Secretary Chris Grayling who had blocked Sadiq Khan 's proposal that Transport for London should be given control of the capital's suburban railways. They marched to the Department for Transport where they called on the Government to intervene in the dispute, and for an independent inquiry into what they described as the \"collapse of Southern Rail\".

{"id": "doc_random_183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Guntrip", "text": "Henry James Samuel Guntrip (29 May 1901 \u2013 18 February 1975) was a British psychoanalyst known for his major contributions to object relations theory or school of Freudian thought. He was a Fellow of the British Psychological Society and a psychotherapist and lecturer at the Department of Psychiatry, Leeds University , and also a Congregationalist minister . He was described by Jock Sutherland as \"one of the psychoanalytic immortals\". Work Guntrip's Personality Structure and Human Interaction organised, critiqued and synthesised the theories of major psychoanalysts, including Melanie Klein , Ronald Fairbairn , D. W. Winnicott , and Michael Balint . Although he accepted many of Freud's theories, he also advanced his own ideas and criticised Freud as being too based on biology in general, and instincts in particular, and therefore being, in Guntrip's belief, dehumanising. He also drew heavily on the object relational approach of Fairbairn and Winnicott. He argued that the regressed ego, which is perhaps his greatest contribution to psychoanalysis, exerts a powerful effect on life. He viewed the schizoid sense of emptiness as reflecting the withdrawal of energy from the real world into a world of internal object relations. His personal symptoms led him to be psychoanalysed by both W.R.D. Fairbairn and D.W. Winnicott. Although helpful, the therapy did not cure his problem. On the schizoid personality Guntrip worked extensively with schizoid patients who were detached, withdrawn, and unable to form meaningful human relations. He came to regard the self as the fundamental psychological concept, psychoanalysis as the study of its growth, and psychoanalytic therapy as a means of providing a personal relationship in which the alienated, withdrawn self is given an opportunity for healthy growth and development, and finally putting it in touch with other persons and objects. He delineated the following nine characteristics of the schizoid personality: introversion , withdrawnness, narcissism , self-sufficiency, a sense of superiority, loss of affect , loneliness, depersonalisation , and regression . These are described in more detail below. Introversion Guntrip described the schizoid's inner world thus: \"By the very meaning of the term, the schizoid is described as cut off from the world of outer reality in an emotional sense. All this libidinal desire and striving is directed inward toward internal objects and he lives an intense inner life often revealed in an astonishing wealth and richness of fantasy and imaginative life whenever that becomes accessible to observation. Though mostly his varied fantasy life is carried on in secret, hidden away.\" The schizoid person is so cut off from outer reality as to experience it as dangerous. It is a natural human response to turn away from sources of danger and toward sources of safety. The schizoid individual, therefore, is primarily concerned with avoiding danger and ensuring safety. Withdrawnness Withdrawnness means detachment from the outer world, the other side of introversion. Only a small portion of schizoid individuals present with a clear and obvious timidity, reluctance, or avoidance of the external world and interpersonal relationships. Many fundamentally schizoid people present with an engaging, interactive personality style . Such a person can appear to be available, interested, engaged and involved in interacting with others, but he or she may in reality be emotionally withdrawn and sequestered in a safe place in an internal world. Withdrawnness is a characteristic feature of schizoid pathology , but it is sometimes overt and sometimes covert. Overt withdrawnness matches the usual description of the schizoid personality, but withdrawnness is just as often a covert, hidden, internal state of the patient. The patient's observable behaviour may not accurately reflect the internal state of their mind. One should not mistake introversion for indifference, and one should not miss identifying the schizoid patient due to misinterpretation of the patient's defensive, compensatory, engaging interaction with external reality. Narcissism Guntrip defines narcissism as \"a characteristic that arises out of the predominantly interior life the schizoid lives. His love objects are all inside him and moreover he is greatly identified with them so that his libidinal attachments appear to be in himself. The question, however, is whether the intense inner life of the schizoid is due to a desire for hungry incorporation of external objects or due to withdrawal from the outer to a presumed safer inner world.\" The need for attachment as a primary motivational force is as strong in the schizoid person as in any other human being. Because the schizoid's love objects are internal, they find safety without connecting and attaching to objects in the real world (see Narcissistic defences ). Self-sufficiency Guntrip observed that a sense of superiority accompanies self-sufficiency. \"One has no need of other people, they can be dispensed with... There often goes with it a feeling of being different from other people.\" The sense of superiority of the schizoid has nothing to do with the grandiose self of the narcissistic disorder. It does not find expression in the schizoid through the need to devalue or annihilate others who are perceived as offending, criticising, shaming, or humiliating. This type of superiority was described by a young schizoid man: \"If I am superior to others, if I am above others, then I do not need others. When I say that I am above others, it does not mean that I feel better than them, it means that I am at a distance from them, a safe distance.\" It is a feeling of security rather than of superiority. Loss of affect Further information: Affect (psychology) Guntrip saw loss of affect as inevitable, as the tremendous investment made in the self interferes with the desire and ability to be empathic and sensitive toward another person's experience. These things often seem secondary to securing one's own defensive, safe position. The subjective experience is one of loss of affect. Some patients experience loss of affect to such a degree that the insensitivity becomes manifest in the extreme as cynicism , callousness, or even cruelty. The patient appears to have no awareness of how his or her comments or actions affect and hurt other people. This loss of affect is more frequently manifest within the patient as genuine confusion, a sense of something missing in his or her emotional life. Loneliness Guntrip observed that the preceding characteristics result in loneliness: \"Loneliness is an inescapable result of schizoid introversion and abolition of external relationships . It reveals itself in the intense longing for friendship and love which repeatedly break through. Loneliness in the midst of a crowd is the experience of the schizoid cut off from affective rapport.\" This is a central experience of the schizoid that is often lost to the observer. Contrary to the familiar caricature of the schizoid as uncaring and cold, the vast majority of schizoid persons who become patients express at some point in their treatment their longing for friendship and love. This is not the schizoid patient as described in the DSMs. Such longing, however, may not break through except in the schizoid's fantasy life, to which the therapist may not be allowed access for quite a long period in treatment. There is a very narrow range of classic DSM-defined schizoids for whom the hope of establishing relationships is so minimal as to be almost extinct. The longing for closeness and attachment is almost unidentifiable to such a person. These individuals will not voluntarily become patients, as the schizoid individual who becomes a patient does so often because of the twin motivations of loneliness and longing. This type of patient believes that some kind of connection and attachment is possible and is well suited to psychotherapy . The psychotherapist, however, may approach the schizoid patient with a sense of therapeutic pessimism, if not nihilism , and may misread the patient by believing that the patient's wariness is indifference and that caution is coldness. Depersonalization Guntrip describes depersonalization as a loss of a sense of identity and individuality. Depersonalization is a dissociative defence, often described by the schizoid patient as \"tuning out\", \"turning off\", or as the experience of a separation between the observing and the participating ego . It is experienced most profoundly when anxieties seem overwhelming and is a more extreme form of loss of affect: whereas the loss of affect is a more chronic state in schizoid personality disorder, depersonalisation is an acute defence against more immediate experiences of overwhelming anxiety or danger. Regression Further information: Regression (psychology) Guntrip defined regression as \"Representing the fact that the schizoid person at bottom feels overwhelmed by their external world and is in flight from it both inwards and as it were backwards to the safety of the metaphorical womb.\" Such a process of regression encompasses two different mechanisms: inward and backwards. Regression inward speaks to the magnitude of the reliance on primitive forms of fantasy and self-containment, often of an autoerotic or even objectless nature. Regression backwards to the safety of the womb is a unique schizoid phenomenon and represents the most intense form of schizoid defensive withdrawal in an effort to find safety and to avoid destruction by external reality, which has been conflated with the challenging parental models faced by the subject following exit from the womb upon physical birth. The fantasy of regression to the womb is the fantasy of regression to a place of ultimate safety. Published works Schizoid Phenomena, Object-Relations, and the Self (1968). Karnac Books.

Set in Ottawa in 1979, the film stars Matthew Ferguson as Peter Cort, a researcher writing a book on male circumcision , and Michael Achtman as Peter Koosens, his assistant who has a sexual obsession with Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and regularly doctors photographs to depict himself and Trudeau in romantic entanglements. They later meet Peter Denham ( Damon D'Oliveira ), a video artist who sets his films to Jackson Five songs. After Denham inserts photographs of Koosens and Trudeau into one of his videos, the three are arrested for copyright violation by an opera -singing police officer, put on trial in a courtroom scene set to La Habanera , and sent to a prison boot camp. The film is also intercut with documentary footage of artists such as John Oswald , A. A. Bronson , Linda Griffiths and Thomas Waugh discussing censorship , as well as Trudeau himself invoking martial law during the 1970 October Crisis . The film was inspired in part by the then emerging debate about outing closeted LGBT people, while the copyright themes were inspired by Greyson's battle with the estate of Kurt Weill over the use of parody versions of Weill songs in his early short film The Making of Monsters .

Biography della Rovere was born in Lucca in 1471, the son of Francesco Franciotti and Luchina della Rovere, a member of the House of della Rovere . He was a grandnephew of Pope Sixtus IV and a nephew of Pope Julius II . His half-brother, Sisto Gara della Rovere , also became a cardinal. He was elected Bishop of Lucca in October or November 1503 and occupied that office until his death. He was consecrated as a bishop by his uncle Pope Julius II. Pope Julius II made him a cardinal priest in the consistory of 29 November 1503. He received the red hat and the titular church of San Pietro in Vincoli on 6 December 1503. On 30 August 1504 he became the apostolic administrator of the see of Benevento , and filled this office until his death. He became administrator of the see of Cremona from 27 May 1505, holding that post until shortly before his death. He was Vice- Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church from 31 May 1505 until his death. In May 1506, he was papal legate to Bologna . In August 1507, he became administrator of the see of Vicenza . He was a patron of the arts and a good friend of Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici, who later became Pope Leo X . One historian notes: \"Although Giovio states explicitly that this newly formed intimacy between the Medici and Franciotto had its origin in the diplomatic aims of the former rather than in any mutual inclination of the two young men, yet it is certain that ere long Giovanni grew deeply attached to Galeotto, and that the sorrow expressed by him at the papal nephew's sudden and premature death was both genuine and abiding, for on the testimony of Tommaso Inghirami, we learn that in after years, when the Cardinal de' Medici had been transformed into the Pontiff Leo X, he could not endure to hear Galeotto's name mentioned in his presence, and if anyone were so careless as to allude to his passed friend, the Pope would invariably turn aside his face to hide the tears he was unable to repress. And in the Medici's case this instance of real affection is of peculiar interest, for with the exception of his brother Giuliano, there exists no record of Leo showing any strong affection towards any one of his contemporaries save this nephew of Julius II.\" The services of della Rovere to England as Cardinal protector are noted as the granting of a papal indulgence to John Mortymen, a chamber of official of King Henry VII, on 21 June 1506; arranging for Pope Julius II to make (on 18 August 1506) Robert Haldesworth of the Archdiocese of York a papal notary; and on Candlemas Day (15 February 1507/8), ceremoniously accepting candles blessed by the pope to give to Hugh Inge to take to the royal court. His last recorded act was to persuade the Pope to grant King Henry VII's demand to have revenues from the episcopal see of Durham diverted to the costs of repairing fortifications along the border between England and Scotland, which the Pope granted on 26 July 1508; della Rovere suddenly died less than two months later, in Rome , on 11 September 1508. He is buried in Santi Apostoli, Rome . References ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m \"Biographical Dictionary of the Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church\" . Archived from the original on 2017-06-12 .

Statue of a woman, perhaps the empress Vibia Sabina , dressed as Pudicitia Pudicitia (\"modesty\" or \"sexual virtue\") was a central concept in ancient Roman sexual ethics . The word is derived from the more general pudor , the sense of shame that regulated an individual's behavior as socially acceptable. Pudicitia was most often a defining characteristic of women, but men who failed to conform to masculine sexual norms were said to exhibit feminizing impudicitia , sexual shamelessness. The virtue was personified by the Roman goddess Pudicitia, whose Greek equivalent was Aidos . As virtue Bust of a Modest Roman Woman of the Severan Period 193-211 CE at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York Romans, both men and women, were expected to uphold the virtue of pudicitia , a complex ideal that was explored by many ancient writers, including Livy , Valerius Maximus , Cicero , Tacitus and Tertullian . Livy describes the legendary figure of Lucretia as the epitome of pudicitia . She is loyal to her husband and is modest, despite her incredible beauty. Some say that the story of Lucretia shows that the more virtuous a woman was, the more appealing she was to potential adulterers. Pudicitia was not only a mental attribute but also physical; a person's appearance was seen as an indicator of their morality. The way a man or woman presented him or herself in public, and the persons they interacted with caused others to pass judgment on their pudicitia . For example, if a woman was seen associating with men other than her husband people would make a negative judgment on her pudicitia . Romans idealized the woman who was univira , a \"one-man\" woman, married once, even though by the time of Cicero and Julius Caesar , divorce was common, the subject of gossip rather than social stigma. Modest self-presentation indicated pudicitia . The opposite of pudicitia was impudicitia , \"shamelessness\" or \u201csexual vice.\u201d An assault on pudicitia was stuprum , sexual misconduct or \"sex crime.\" Romans associated the loss of pudicitia with chaos and loss of control. In Cicero's oration against Verres , he discusses many of the governor's transgressions including sexual misconduct with both men and women. In the Imperial age, Augustus enacted a program of moral legislation to encourage pudicitia . Pudicitia depicted on the reverse of an antoninianus of Herennia Etruscilla The goddess According to Livy , there were two temples of Pudicitia in Rome, the Temple of Pudicitia Patricia and the Temple of Pudicitia Plebeia . The original one was for women of the patrician class only, but when Verginia was excluded on account of marrying a plebeian consul , she and a group of plebeian matrons founded an altar of Pudicitia for women of the plebeian class as well. Livy states that the plebeian shrine of Pudicitia eventually fell into disuse after its sacred character had been abused. According to Juvenal , at the end of the Iron Age humanity had grown so cruel and greedy that Pudicitia along with her sister Astraea , goddess of justice, abandoned the earth and returned to the heavens, leaving humans to deal with their evil unguided.

{"id": "doc_random_191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FROG", "text": "This article is about the block cipher algorithm. For the ultrafast laser pulse measurement technique, see Frequency-resolved optical gating . For other uses, see Frog (disambiguation) . In cryptography , FROG is a block cipher authored by Georgoudis, Leroux and Chaves. The algorithm can work with any block size between 8 and 128 bytes , and supports key sizes between 5 and 125 bytes. The algorithm consists of 8 rounds and has a very complicated key schedule . It was submitted in 1998 by TecApro, a Costa Rican software company, to the AES competition as a candidate to become the Advanced Encryption Standard . Wagner et al. (1999) found a number of weak key classes for FROG. Other problems included very slow key setup and relatively slow encryption. FROG was not selected as a finalist. Design philosophy Normally a block cipher applies a fixed sequence of primitive mathematical or logical operators (such as additions, XORs , etc.) on the plaintext and secret key in order to produce the ciphertext . An attacker uses this knowledge to search for weaknesses in the cipher which may allow the recovery of the plaintext. FROG's design philosophy is to hide the exact sequence of primitive operations even though the cipher itself is known. While other ciphers use the secret key only as data (which are combined with the plain text to produce the cipher text), FROG uses the key both as data and as instructions on how to combine these data. In effect an expanded version of the key is used by FROG as a program. FROG itself operates as an interpreter that applies this key-dependent program on the plain text to produce the cipher text. Decryption works by applying the same program in reverse on the cipher text. Description High level view of FROG The FROG key schedule (or internal key) is 2304 bytes long. It is produced recursively by iteratively applying FROG to an empty plain text. The resulting block is processed to produce a well formatted internal key with 8 records. FROG has 8 rounds, the operations of each round codified by one record in the internal key. All operations are byte-wide and consist of XORs and substitutions. FROG is very easy to implement (the reference C version has only about 150 lines of code). Much of the code needed to implement FROG is used to generate the secret internal key; the internal cipher itself is a very short piece of code. It is possible to write an assembly routine of just 22 machine instructions that does full FROG encryption and decryption. The implementation will run well on 8 bit processors because it uses only byte-level instructions. No bit-specific operations are used. Once the internal key has been computed, the algorithm is fairly fast: a version implemented using 8086 assembler achieves processing speeds of over 2.2 megabytes per second when run on a 200\u00a0MHz Pentium PC. Security FROG's design philosophy is meant to defend against unforeseen/unknown types of attacks. Nevertheless, the very fact that the key is used as the encryption program means that some keys may correspond to weak encryption programs. David Wagner et al. found that 2 \u221233 of the keys are weak and that in these cases the key can be broken with 2 58 chosen plaintexts . Another flaw of FROG is that the decryption function has a much slower diffusion than the encryption function. Here 2 \u221229 of keys are weak and can be broken using 2 36 chosen ciphertexts.

{"id": "doc_random_193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_and_Hammered", "text": "Armed and Hammered is a hardcore punk band from Toronto , Ontario, spawned from Bunchofuckingoofs scene of the early 1980s. History Originally formed by singer Mopa Dean, the bassist for Masochistic Religion , and drummer Kyle Peek, the earliest lineup also included Lamo, Philphee Saunders and Bunchofuckingoofs Thor Hammersen. They played their first show June 7, 1989. By the end of 1990, they had recorded enough live performances that they were able to independently release a 17-track collection called Promoting Peace To Violence 89-90 . Eight of those songs appeared on their 1991 12-track demo tape, Fully Loaded . By this time, Lamo, Saunders and Hammersen had been replaced by guitarist Hardcore Dave and bassist Kieran Plunkett. In 1992, guitarists Big John and Dorian Wilde replaced Hardcore Dave. This line-up was featured on the next several releases: split EPs with Suckerpunch and Oppressed Logic , the song \"Rat Poison\" which was included in the Raw Energy Records punk compilation Dead on the Road - Songs Without Keyboards , and the song \"Beans and Toast\" which was included in the 1996 Ransom Note Recordings Compilation Living in Fear . In 1995, Armed and Hammered claimed that they were banned from a repeat performance on Much Music . The band had played the Kumbaya Festival , which was held at the Molson Amphitheatre (now The Budweiser Stage ) to benefit people living with AIDS. It was broadcast live across Canada and rebroadcast the following day; Much Music removed the band's performance from the rebroadcast and replaced it with an R.E.M. video. The band's line-up would change again. Guitarist Dorian Wilde left in 1994 and was replaced by Kurf. Kieran Plunkett moved to the UK where he toured with The Varukers and formed The Restarts . He was replaced by Rick Giroux, who was replaced in 1997 by former Heatseekers and Suckerpunch bassist, Cindy Beattie. The band's debut full-length album, It's About Fucking Time , was recorded over 1996 and 1997 and features both Rick and Cindy. The CD also features re-recordings of many songs from earlier releases. It also spent some time in the independent charts in Canada. Also in 1996, the European label Subvert & Deny released the four-track EP More Punk Rock Than You . In 1998, Kurf left the band and was replaced by former Abalienation guitarist, Mark Dickinson. In 2000, following the release of the Negative Aspects of Positive Thinking CD, Mark returned to the US, leaving Armed and Hammered once again with one guitarist. In 2000, Mopa left the group to be replaced by Jaww singer Doug McLarty. After Mopa's departure, the group became mostly inactive, playing only a handful of gigs before their final shows in early 2003. Mopa formed a band called The G-Men in 2002; they played at least one gig with Armed & Hammered, on November 15, 2002, at Sneaky Dee's in Toronto. These final shows featured the return of former members Kurf and Rick. Armed and Hammered reunited to play a set in support of English group GBH 's tour stop at the Mod Club Theatre in Toronto in July 2010, then reformed in May 2012. The band is still performing and recording. In February 2021, they released a four-track split with Vulgar Deli.

{"id": "doc_random_195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB_Class_E_10", "text": "The class E 10 is an electric locomotive of the Deutsche Bundesbahn , introduced in 1952. It belongs to the Einheits-Elektrolokomotiven (standardised electric locomotives) program and was built for express passenger service. In 1968 the series was redesignated as class 110 (E10) and class 112 (E10.12). In 1988 the last series of class 112 locomotives were designated as class 114, and in 1991 the remaining locomotives of class 112 were designated as class 113. In 2006 38 locomotives were designated as class 115. Until 2020, individual locomotives of the 115 series were used for \"special passenger trains\". All locomotives of this series have now been retired from regular service by DB, but some are still in active use by private railway companies. Development history In 1950, the Deutsche Bundesbahn decided to develop two base types of electric locomotives with largely standardised components: A twelve-wheel (UIC: Co'Co') freight train locomotive as successor for the Class E 94 , and an eight-wheel (UIC: Bo'Bo') general purpose electric locomotive as successor for the Class E 44 . As a new feature the engineers should be able to be seated, whereas formerly they had to stand in order to boost their attentiveness. This multi-purpose locomotive received the working title E 46, but was then renamed to Class E 10, once the required maximum speed was increased from 125 to 130\u00a0km/h (78 to 81\u00a0mph), which formally made this model an express train locomotive. The trial program, which consisted of 5 prototypes of class E 10.0, resulted in the realization that a single uniform type of electric locomotive was not sufficient to cover all needs. The modified program then included a local passenger train locomotive ( class E 41 ); an express train locomotive (class E 10), which could be changed into a freight train locomotive (Class E 40) with a gear ratio change, and a heavy six-axle freight train locomotive ( class E 50 ). In addition plans for a high speed electric locomotive Class E 01 were made, but quickly cancelled, as, due to low maximum speeds on the main lines at that time, the class E 10 was seen as sufficient for express trains. Production of class E 10 The five prototypes of class E 10.0 were taken out of service between 1975 and 1978. Of these E 10 003 and E 10 005 were preserved as museum locomotives. The first serial units went into service in 1956 and started with number E 10 101 (class E 10.1). As opposed to class E 40 these units were equipped with a rheostatic/regenerative brake, which also accounted for the difference in the roof design between the two classes. Starting in December 1956 a total of 379 locomotives in several series were delivered by the manufacturers ( Krupp , Henschel , Krauss-Maffei (mechanical parts); Siemens , AEG , BBC (electrical parts). Starting with E 10 288 the new body created for E 10.12 (see below), the so-called \"crease\" ( B\u00fcgelfalte ) type, was also applied to new-production E 10 machines. Thereafter these locomotives were sometimes designated as class E 10.3. One locomotive (designated 751 001, former 110 385) served as a service locomotive for the Central Office of the German Federal Railways in Minden ( BZA Minden , or Bahnzentralamt ) from 1989 to 1996. The earlier units up to E10 287 became E10.1, then 110.1 in 1968; they were nicknamed \" Kasten \", for box. The service spectrum of the (since 1968 as class 110 designated) locomotives was shifted more and more to local/regional service by the 1990s. As part of this shift, during the third stage of the Bahn reform program the locomotives were assigned to the local service branch DB Regio, which practically meant the end of their service in the express area. In order to use the machines more efficiently in regional service, from 1997 many of the units were equipped with push-pull train controls, partly using components of class 140 and class 141 units that were retired. Originally the class E 10 units were delivered in cobalt blue express train livery, the blue indicating that they were cleared for a maximum speed of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph) or more. Starting in 1974, as part of other maintenance, the new ocean blue/beige colour scheme was applied to the locomotives. From 1987 the (then-current) orient-red was used, which was then substituted, starting in 1997, with the traffic red ( verkehrsrot ) concept, which is the current colour of all active locomotives of this class, barring a few exceptions. Construction As all other types of the Einheitslokomotiven program, the class E 10 / class 110 had 2-axle pivoted bogies/trucks as welded box construction with pivot pins, and welded superstructure with fan grills. The class 110.3 used the body of the E 10.12 with the pulled-forward frontal area, also called the \u201ccrease\u201d (B\u00fcgelfalte). The frame is propped up over the bogies by coil springs and rubber elements. Originally a bumpy ride at higher speeds was noticeable, which required repeated rework of the bogies. In two locomotives (110 475 and 476) a flexicoil suspension was tested. All locomotives feature an indirect air brake manufactured by Knorr, with automatically stronger braking action at high speeds; for shunting/switching service an additional direct brake is present. All units also feature a separately excited rheostatic/regenerative brake, which is coupled to the air brake. The heat generated by the electric brakes is dissipated via roof exhausts. For the first time in German locomotives high voltage regulation of the transformer was used in serial production. The traction motors are 14-pole motors of type WB 372, which were later again used in class 111 and 151. As was the case in all locomotives in the Einheitslokomotiven program, the rubber ring transmission system made by the Siemens-Schuckert-Werke/SSW was utilized, which had proven themselves above all expectations in the prototype E 10.0 units. On the roof are found scissor (double-arm) pantographs of the type DBS 54a, standardized for all Einheits classes, mounted on the obligatory roof insulators, as well as the compressed air main switch and the current-to-voltage converter for the monitoring of the overhead wire voltage. The 3-core transformers are oil-cooled, to which the control unit with its 28 running steps is connected. The acceleration is designed to function in delayed mode, where the engineer chooses the running step, and the control unit will initiate the chosen setting independently. For emergency operation manual control by hand crank is possible. Many locomotives feature thyristor load diverters. The safety equipment in the driver's cab features either a mechanical or electronic deadman's device, punctiform automatic train controls (now compliant with the new regulations with software version PZB 90), and train radio equipment with GSM-R communication. Relatively recently computers were added for the electronic timetable EBuLa, as well as the automatic door locking at 0\u00a0km/h (TB0), which has become a compulsory requirement for all locomotives in passenger service. A few units have also been equipped with computers for the control system CIR-ELKE. Variants Class E 10.12 / class 112 (1962-1991) DB Class 112 engines in Hamburg 1984 During production some E 10 units were equipped with newly developed Henschel-made bogies and transmissions fit for speeds up to 160 km/h, and starting in 1962-63 they pulled long-distance express trains such as the Rheingold , and were classified as class E 10.12 (and from 1968 designated as class 112). In addition these locomotives introduced the more aerodynamic superstructure (the \"crease\", or B\u00fcgelfalte ), which was used for all new units of the class E 10, starting with E 10 288. In order to differentiate these units from the \"normal\" E 10s, a \"1\" (indicating a sub-class) was placed in front of the running number. In this way the E 10 1265-1270 were established, which became the eponym for the class description of E 10.12. In 1963-64 came E 10 1308-1312, again with Henschel-made high-speed bogies, primarily for the Rheinpfeil . Neither group of E10.12 locomotives was ready in time for the launch of the trains for which they were ordered. Pending their delivery, 2 separate groups of E10.1 locomotives (E10 239-244 in 1962-63, and E10 250-254 in 1963-64) were temporarily modified for 160\u00a0km/h service, with only E10 244 and E10 250-254 receiving the Henschel bogies. However, all would gain the prefix 1 to their running numbers, the modified 160\u00a0km/h gear ratios, and the appropriate paint scheme. All were later restored to normal E10.1 standards. Finally, in 1968, came 112 485, already designated as class 112, which did not have the expensive Henschel bogies, but featured modified serial-production bogies. Class 113 (1991-today) DB Class 113 locomotive By 1991 it had become clear that the deployment of the 11 locomotives of the first two series of class 112 in heavy and fast service had taken its toll. Several gear wheel malfunctions during service caused heavy damage to motor and transmission of the affected units. The maximum speed was reduced to 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) as an emergency measure, and the locomotives were only utilized as express trains in the Munich area. At the time they were already re-designated as class 113, in order to free up the designation of class 112 in the new German number scheme (for the more numerous and modern class 212 locomotives of the former Deutsche Reichsbahn (East Germany) ). In the meantime these locomotives, after some units had been fitted with refurbished Henschel high-speed bogies in the mid-1990s, were able to again work at the speed of 160\u00a0km/h, but were considered not to be much better than the normal class 110 units, and were soon listed for impending retirement. Class 114 (1988-1995) Class 114 is made up of 20 re-designated units from the third series of class 112, which were capable of speeds up to 160\u00a0km/h, and ran on modified bogies made for class 110 in serial production. Because of significant wear, starting in 1985 the top speed of locomotives with numbers 112 485-504 was reduced to 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph). To differentiate these units from the other class 112 machines, which were still allowed to travel at 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph), they were designated as class 114 from 1988 on. Further conspicuous issues on and around the bogies continued to be noticed even after the speed reduction, and the locomotives were first further slowed down to 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), and retired altogether soon thereafter. Starting in 1993, using bogies from class 110 units with numbers 110 287 and lower, all 20 of the class 114 locomotives were rebuilt as normal class 110.3 units and were inserted into inventory as 110 485-504. 18 of the class 110, which lost their bogies to these \"new\" 110s, were rebuilt with bogies from retired class 140 locomotives, and were re-designated as members of class 139, with which class they were nearly identical in the first place, due to their electric brake system. (The 2 remaining former class 114s received bogies from 2 other retired class 110.3 units). The concept of the Einheitslokomotive completely paid for itself in this swap exercise. Class 115 - since 2005 DB Class 115 in Frankfurt Starting in 2005 a few former class 110 and class 113 units were transferred from DB Regio to DB Autozug, the DB subsidiary for express passenger service with car transportation. In order to differentiate these units, they are slowly being renumbered to class 115 , and are being relocated to Berlin-Rummelsburg. These locomotives are thereby the first units of this class to be domiciled in the former East Germany. The Class 115 hosts one of the oldest locomotives still in regular passenger service in Germany. 115 114-1 (pictured in 2006 on the left) was introduced on 21 November 1957, and is used on various InterCity services across Germany.

{"id": "doc_random_199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faris_Muslim_al_Ansari", "text": "Faris Muslim al Ansari is a citizen of Afghanistan who was seventeen years old when captured and held in the United States 's Guantanamo Bay detention camps , in Cuba . His Guantanamo Internment Serial Number was 253. American intelligence analysts estimate that Al Ansari was born in 1984 in Mukala, Yemen . Combatant Status Review Tribunal Combatant Status Review Tribunals were held in a 3 x 5 meter trailer. The captive sat with his hands and feet shackled to a bolt in the floor. Three chairs were reserved for members of the press, but only 37 of the 574 Tribunals were observed. Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the Geneva Conventions to captives from the war on terror . This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct competent tribunals to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of prisoner of war status. Subsequently the Department of Defense instituted the Combatant Status Review Tribunals . The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were lawful combatants \u2014rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an enemy combatant . Al Ansari chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal. allegations The allegations Al Ansari faced during his Tribunal were: a. The detainee is a Taliban fighter. The detainee lived with his family in Kabul, Afghanistan. The detainee's home was given to his father by the Taliban. The detainee's father was given rewards for his service to the Taliban. b. The detainee participated in military operations against the coalition. The detainee fought in the Mehjin Region in Tora Bora. While fighting in the Mehjin Region in Tora Bora, the detainee carried a Kalashnikov rifle and an RPG-7. While engaged in commbat with the Northern Alliance, the detainee fired his Kalashnikov rifle and RPG-7. The detainee was captured without identification as he attempted to flee into Afghanistan. Administrative Review Board hearing Hearing room where Guantanamo captive's annual Administrative Review Board hearings convened for captives whose Combatant Status Review Tribunal had already determined they were an \"enemy combatant\". Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as \"enemy combatants\" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual Administrative Review Board hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an \"enemy combatant\". They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat\u2014or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free. The transcript from Al Ansari's Administrative Review Board hearing show he initially planned to participate in his hearing. However, he changed his mind when he asked his Assisting Military Officer, who would be attending the hearing. His Assisting Military Officer said he didn't tell him how many officers would be attending, but he confirmed for him that there wouldn't be any lawyers present. The transcript records the Presiding Officer asking the Designated Military Officer about two individuals, named in the factors favoring Al Ansari's continued detention, who were both associated with guest houses in Kandahar , had similarly spelled names. One was named \"Abu Kaloud\" and the other was named \"Abu Kalood Al Yemeni\" . The Designated Military Officer said he thought they were the same individual, but he would have to double-check. Al Ansari had tried to call for the testimony of an individual named Abu Jahad Al-Yemani during his Tribunal. Medical records On March 16, 2007 the Department of Defense published height and weight records for all but ten of the captives held in Guantanamo. Faris Muslim Al Ansari is one of ten men whose height and weight records were withheld. The Department of Defense has not offered an explanation for why no records for those ten men were published. Repatriation The Department of Defense published the dates captives departed from Guantanamo on 26 November 2008. According to that list Faris al-Ansari was repatriated on December 28, 2007. On January 9, 2009 the Department of Defense published the records for the third set of Administrative Review Board hearings, conducted in 2007 and early 2008. According to those records no review was scheduled for Al-Ansari in 2007. According to the records of the 2005 and 2006 Board hearings, those boards had not recommended his repatriation. Like the nine other men Al-Ansari was repatriated in spite of the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants recommending his continued detention in US custody.

{"id": "doc_random_200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_synchrony", "text": "Menstrual synchrony , also called the McClintock effect , or the Wellesley effect , is a hypothetical process whereby women who begin living together in close proximity would experience their menstrual cycle onsets (the onset of menstruation or menses) becoming more synchronized together in time than when previously living apart. \"For example, the distribution of onsets of seven female lifeguards was scattered at the beginning of the summer, but after 3 months spent together, the onset of all seven cycles fell within a 4-day period.\" Martha McClintock 's 1971 paper, published in Nature , says that menstrual cycle synchronization happens when the menstrual cycle onsets of two or more women become closer together in time than they were several months earlier. After the initial studies, several papers were published reporting methodological flaws in studies reporting menstrual synchrony, including McClintock's study. In addition, other studies were published that failed to find synchrony. The proposed mechanisms have also received scientific criticism. Reviews in 2006 and 2013 concluded that menstrual synchrony likely does not exist. Overview Original study by Martha McClintock Martha McClintock published the first study on menstrual synchrony among women living together in dormitories at Wellesley College , a women's liberal arts college in Massachusetts , US. Proposed causes McClintock hypothesized that pheromones could cause menstrual cycle synchronization. However, other mechanisms have been proposed, most prominently synchronization with lunar phases . Efforts to replicate McClintock's results No scientific evidence supports the lunar hypothesis, and doubt has been cast on pheromone mechanisms. After the initial studies reporting menstrual synchrony began to appear in the scientific literature , other researchers began reporting the failure to find menstrual synchrony. These studies were followed by critiques of the methods used in early studies, which argued that biases in the methods used produced menstrual synchrony as an artifact. More recent studies, which took into account some of these methodological criticisms, have been performed. Menstrual synchrony was not found in some studies such as those done on a natural-fertility population, and college students living together like the original McClintock study Other studies asserted menstrual synchrony's existence, like those done in medical hostels, teammates that played basketball together, and coworkers. Terminology The term synchrony has been argued to be misleading because no study has ever found that menstrual cycles become strictly concordant, nevertheless menstrual synchrony is used to refer the phenomenon of menstrual cycle onsets becoming closer to each other over time. Status of the hypothesis In a 2013 systematic review of menstrual synchrony, Harris and Vitzthum concluded, \"In light of the lack of empirical evidence for MS [menstrual synchrony] sensu stricto , it seems there should be more widespread doubt than acceptance of this hypothesis\" (pp.\u00a0238\u2013239). The experience of synchrony may be the result of the mathematical fact that menstrual cycles of different frequencies repeatedly converge and diverge over time and not due to a process of synchronization, and the probability of encountering such overlaps by chance is high. Evolutionary perspective Researchers are divided on whether menstrual synchrony would be adaptive. McClintock has suggested that menstrual synchrony may not be adaptive but rather epiphenomenal , lacking any biological function . Among those who postulate an adaptive function, one argument is that menstrual synchrony is only a particular aspect of the much more general phenomenon of reproductive synchrony , an occurrence familiar to ecologists studying animal populations in the wild. Whether seasonal, tidal, or lunar, reproductive synchrony is a relatively common mechanism through which co-cycling females can increase the number of males included in the local breeding system. Conversely, it has been argued that if there are too many females cycling together, they would be competing for the highest quality males, forcing female\u2013female competition for high quality mates and thereby lowering fitness. In such cases, selection should favor avoiding synchrony. Divergent climate regimes differentiating Neanderthal reproductive strategies from those of modern Homo sapiens have recently been analysed in these terms. Turning to the evolutionary past, a possible adaptive basis for the biological capacity would be reproductive levelling: among primates, synchronising to any natural clock makes it difficult for an alpha male to monopolise fertile sex with multiple females. This would be consistent with the striking gender egalitarianism of extant non-storage hunter-gatherer societies. When early Pleistocene hominids in Africa were attempting to survive by robbing big cats of their kills, according to some evolutionary scientists, it may have been adaptive to restrict overnight journeys\u2014including sexual liaisons\u2014to times when there was a moon in the sky. Media attention The question of whether those who live together do in fact synchronize their menstrual cycles has also received attention in the popular media. Traditional myth and ritual Two women dancing. Rock engraving from the Upper Yule River, Pilbara , Western Australia. The idea that menstruation is \u2013 or ideally ought to be \u2013 in harmony with wider cosmic rhythms is one of the most tenacious ideas central to the myths and rituals of traditional communities across the world. String was first made by the two Wawalik Sisters at Mudawa, near Buckingham Bay .... The sisters sat down, looking at each other, with their feet out and legs apart, and both menstruated... Each one made a loop of the other one's menstrual blood, after which they put the string loops around their necks. The !Kung (or Ju|'hoansi) hunter-gatherers of the Kalahari \"believe ... that if a woman sees traces of menstrual blood on another woman's leg or even is told that another woman has started her period, she will begin menstruating as well\". Among the Yurok people of northwestern California, according to one ethnographic study, \"all of a household's fertile women who were not pregnant menstruated at the same time...\". She said that she had been instructed in the menstrual laws by her maternal aunts and grandmother, who in their times were well-known, conservative Yurok women.... the young woman said that in old-time village life all of a household's fertile women who were not pregnant menstruated at the same time, a time dictated by the moon; that these women practised bathing rituals together at this time... If a woman got out of synchronization with the moon and with the other women of the household, she could 'get back in by sitting in the moonlight and talking to the moon, asking it to balance her'. Scientific details The phenomenon of menstrual synchrony is the closeness in time of the menstrual cycle onsets of two or more women. The phenomenon is not synchronization in the strict sense of concordance of menstrual cycle onsets but the term menstrual synchrony is still used perhaps misleadingly. As an undergraduate, Martha McClintock published the first study on menstrual synchrony; her report detailed the menstrual synchrony of undergraduate women living in a dormitory in Wellesley College . Since then, there have been attempts to replicate her findings and to determine the conditions under which synchrony occurs, if it exists. Her work was followed up by studies reporting menstrual synchrony and by other studies that failed to find synchrony. Thus, a number of studies were published from the 1980s to the mid 2000s, which attempted to replicate menstrual synchrony in college women, determine the conditions under which menstrual synchrony occurred, and to address methodological issues that were raised as these studies were published. The rest of this section discusses these studies in chronological order, briefly presenting their findings and main conclusions grouped by decade followed by general methodological issues in menstrual synchrony research. Studies 1970s Group synchrony scores over time with 99% confidence intervals from McClintock's study (an approximation of Fig 1). In October, the mean onset difference was about 6.5 days and by the end of the study the mean onset difference decreased by almost 2 days. McClintock's study consisted of 135 female college students who were 17 to 22 years old at the time of the study. They were all residents of a single dormitory, which had four main corridors. The women were asked when their last and second to last menstrual period had started three times during the academic year (which ranged from September to April). They also were asked who (other women in the dormitory) they associated with most and how often each week they associated with males. From these data, McClintock placed women into pairs of close friends and roommates and she also placed them into groups of friends ranging in size from 5 to 10 women. She reported statistically significant synchrony for both her pairwise sorting of women and her group sorting of women. That is, whether women were placed into pairs of close friends and roommates or whether they were placed into larger groups of friends, she reported that they synchronized their menstrual cycles. She also reported that the more often women associated with males, the shorter their menstrual cycles were. She speculated that this may be a pheromone effect paralleling the Whitten effect in mice but that it could not explain menstrual synchrony among women. Finally, she speculated that there could be a pheromone mechanism of menstrual synchrony similar to the Lee-Boot effect in mice. 1980s Graham and McGrew were the first researchers to attempt to replicate McClintock's study. There were 79 women living in halls of residence or apartments on the campus of a college in Scotland . The women were 17 to 21 years old at the time of the study and the procedures followed were similar to those used in McClintock's study. She partially replicated McClintock's study reporting that close friends but not neighbors synchronized their cycles. Unlike in McClintock's study, close friends did not synchronize in groups. They considered a pheromone mechanism a possible explanation of synchrony, but noted that if pheromones were the cause, neighbors should have synchronized as well. They concluded that the mechanism of synchrony remains unknown, but emotional attachment may play a role. Quadagno et al. conducted the second replication of McClintock's study. There were 85 women living in dormitories, sorority houses , and apartments who attended a large midwestern university in the United States . Their study used methods similar to McClintock's study except in addition to two women living together, there were also groups of three and four women living together. They reported that the women synchronized their menstrual cycles and concluded that pheromones may have played a role in synchronization. Jarett's study was the third to attempt to replicate McClintock's original study using college roommates. There were 144 women who attended two colleges. The women were 17 to 22 years old and the procedures followed were similar to McClintock's study except only pairs of roommates were used. She reported that the women did not synchronize. Jarett concluded that whether menstrual synchrony occurs in a group of women may depend on the variability of their menstrual cycles. She conjectured that the reason the women in her study did not synchronize their menstrual cycles was because they happened to have longer and more irregular menstrual cycles than in McClintock's original study. 1990s Wilson, Kiefhabe, and Gravel conducted two studies with college women. The first study consisted of 132 women who were members of a sorority or roommates of members at the University of Missouri . The women were 18 to 22 years of age and the study aimed to replicate McClintock's original study. However, instead of asking women to recall when their last and next to last menstrual onsets occurred, one of the researchers visited the sorority daily to record the occurrence of menstrual onsets and to collect other biographical data. The second study consisted of 24 women living in a cooperative house near the University of Missouri. The women were 18 to 31 years of age. One of the researchers visited the house three times a week recording menstrual onset and collecting more extensive biographical and psychological test data than in the first study. They found no menstrual synchrony in either study. They considered the possibility that women with irregular cycles may reduce the likelihood of detecting synchrony, so they re-analyzed their data after they removed women with irregular cycles, but again there was no statistically significant effect of synchrony. They concluded that \"It is clear no meaningful process of selection or exclusion of pairs can produce a significant level of menstrual synchrony in our samples... Therefore, whether or not menstrual synchrony occurs among women who spend time together must remain a hypothesis requiring further investigation\" (p.\u00a0358). Weller and Weller conducted a study with 20 lesbian couples. They hypothesized that contact within couples should be maximal and contact with men minimal compared to previous studies, which should maximize the likelihood of detecting synchrony. The women ranged in age between 19 and 34 years of age. This was the first study that did not explicitly use college women, but instead the women were recruited at a bar by a research assistant who was a proprietor of a bar . Unlike previous studies, they only asked the women for the date of their last menstrual onset. They then assumed that all the women had menstrual cycles that were exactly 28 days long. Based on this assumption and one menstrual onset for each woman in a couple, they calculated the degree of synchrony. They reported that more than half of the couples had synchronized within a two-day timespan of each other. Trevathan, Burleson, and Gregory also conducted a study with 29 lesbian couples (22 to 48 years of age), but they incorporated the methodological critique of Wilson into the design of their study. In particular, Wilson emphasized the importance of using actual menstrual cycle lengths with their inherent variability. The lesbian couples were drawn from a larger sample of women who had kept daily records of their menstrual cycles for three months and who had participated in a previous study. They found no evidence of synchrony. They discussed several factors that could have prevented synchrony in their study but they strongly suggested that menstrual synchrony may not be a real phenomenon because of the methodological issues Wilson raised and because menstrual synchrony appears to lack adaptive significance. In addition to the study they conducted with lesbian couples, Weller and Weller conducted a number of other studies on menstrual synchrony during the 1990s. In most studies they reported finding menstrual synchrony, but in some studies they did not find synchrony. In a methodological review article in 1997, they refined their approach to measuring to better handle the problem of cycle variability. Specifically, they concluded that several menstrual cycles should be measured from each woman and that the longest average cycle length in a pair or group of women should be the basis for calculating the expected cycle onset difference. Thus, their research falls into the pre-1997 methodology and post-1997 methodology. Bedouin women from Israel In 1997, Weller and Weller published one of the first studies to investigate when menstrual synchrony occurs in complete families. Their study was conducted in Bedouin villages in northern Israel . Twenty seven families, which had from two to seven sisters 13 years or older and collected data on menstrual cycle onsets over a three-month period. Using the methods of, they reported menstrual synchrony occurred for the first two months, but not for the third month for roommate sisters, close friend roommates, and for families as a whole. Dogon women pounding millet Strassmann investigated whether menstrual synchrony occurred in a natural fertility population of Dogon village women. Her study consisted of 122 Dogon women with an average lifetime fertility rate of 8.6 \u00b1 .3 live births per woman. Their median cycle length was 30 days, which is indistinguishable from western women. In analyzing whether menstrual synchrony occurs among Dogon women, she was aware of Wilson's methodological criticisms of previous studies and aware that menstrual synchrony isn't synchrony per se , but rather the closeness of menstruation among women. She used Cox regression to determine whether the likelihood of menstruating was influenced by other women. She considered the levels of all the women in the village, all the women in the same lineage, and all the women in the same economic unit (i.e., they worked together). She found no significant relationship at any level, which means that there was no evidence of synchronization. She concluded that this result undermined the view that menstrual synchrony is adaptive and the view held by many anthropologists at the time that menstrual synchrony occurred in preindustrial societies. 2000s Menstrual synchrony research declined after the published critiques in the 1990s and around the turn of the century. The two studies published during this decade incorporated the methodological critiques into their designs and used more appropriate statistical methods. Yang and Schank conducted the largest study to date with 186 Chinese college women. Ninety three of the women lived in 13 dorm rooms, 5 to 8 women per room. The other ninety three women lived in 16 dorm rooms, 4 to 8 women per room for a total of 29 rooms. The women were given notebooks to record the onset of each of their cycles and they collected data for over a year for most of the women. Following the statistical critiques of Schank, they argued that circular statistics were required to analyze periodic data for the existence of synchrony. However, menstrual cycles are variable in frequency (e.g., 28 or 31 day cycles) and in length. They pointed out that there are no statistical methods for analyzing messy data like this, so they developed Monte Carlo methods for detecting synchrony. They found that in 9 of the 29 groups, women's cycles converged for one cycle closer than expected by chance, but then they diverged again. Upon further analysis, they found that for women with the cycle variability reported in this study, on average 10 out of 29 groups of women would show this pattern of convergence followed by divergence. They concluded that finding 9 out of 29 groups with convergence and then divergence is about what would be expected by chance and concluded that there was no evidence the women in this study synchronized their menstrual cycles. Ziomkiewicz conducted a study with 99 Polish college women living in two dormitories. Thirty six of the women lived in 18 double rooms and sixty three lived in 21 triple rooms. Women recorded their menstrual cycle onsets on menstrual calendars provided to them and 181 days' worth of menstrual cycle data were collected. The mean menstrual cycle length was 30.5 days ( SD = 4.56). Based on the mean cycle length of the women in this study, the expected difference by chance in menstrual cycle onset was approximately 7.5 days. The mean difference in cycle onset was calculated for the beginning, middle, and end of the study for the pairs and triples of women. Ziomkiewicz found no statistically significant difference from the 7.5 day expected difference at either the beginning, middle, or end of the study. She concluded that there was no evidence of menstrual synchrony. Methodological issues Initial onset differences H. Clyde Wilson argued that at the start of any menstrual synchrony study, the minimum cycle onset difference must be calculated by using two onset differences from each woman in a group. For example, suppose two women have exactly 28-day cycles. The greatest distance that one cycle onset can be from another is 14 days. Suppose the first two onsets for woman A are July 1 and July 29 and for woman B , they are July 24 and August 21. If only the first two recorded onsets of A and B are compared, the difference between onsets is 23 days, which is greater than the 14 days that can actually occur. Wilson argued that McClintock did not correctly calculate the initial onset difference among women and concluded that the initial onset difference among women in a group was biased towards asynchrony. Yang and Schank followed up on this point by using computer simulations to estimate the average onset difference that would occur by among women with variable cycle lengths and a mean cycle length of 29.5 days reported by McClintock. They reported that the average onset difference by chance among women with cycle characteristics reported by McClintock was about 5 days. They also calculated the expected onset difference at the beginning of the study using McClintock's method for calculating initial cycle onset differences. They reported that the initial cycle onset difference for the groups of women using McClintock's method was about 6.5 days. McClintock reported that groups of women had an initial cycle onset difference at the beginning of her study of about 6.5 days and then subsequently synchronized to an average difference of a little less than 5 days. Yang and Schank point out that since the expected cycle onset differences they calculated were so close to the differences reported by McClintock, that there may be no statistical difference. They concluded that If their analysis is correct, it implies that synchrony did not occur in McClintock's original study. Hypothesized mechanisms of synchronization Lunar synchronization Cutler and Law hypothesized that menstrual synchrony is caused by menstrual cycles synchronizing with lunar phases . However, neither of them agree on what phase of the lunar cycle menstrual cycles synchronize with. Cutler hypothesizes the synchronization with the full moon and Law with the new moon. Neither offer hypotheses regarding how lunar phases cause menstrual synchrony and neither are consistent with previous studies that found no relationship between menstrual cycles and lunar cycles. More recently, Strassmann investigated menstrual synchrony among Dogon village women. The women were outdoors most nights and did not have electrical lighting. She hypothesized that Dogon women would be ideal for detecting a lunar influence on menstrual cycles, but she found no relationship. Social affiliation Jarett hypothesized that women who were more affiliative and concerned with how others viewed them would synchronize more. In her study, however, women with low affiliation scores were associated with greater synchrony. She found that women with a need for social recognition and approval from others were associated with synchrony, which is partially consistent with her hypothesis. Nevertheless, the group of women she studied did not synchronize their menstrual cycles. Coupled oscillators When McClintock published her study on menstrual synchrony, she speculated that pheromones may cause menstrual synchrony. In a study on Norway rats, McClintock proposed and tested a coupled oscillator hypothesis (see section on rats below). The coupled-oscillator hypothesis proposed estrous cycles in rats were cause by two, estrous phase dependent pheromones that mutually modulated the length of cycles in a group and thereby causing synchrony. This idea was extended to humans in a study by Stern and McClintock. They investigated whether a coupled-oscillator mechanism first reported for Norway rats (see section below on rats) could also exist in humans. The coupled-oscillator hypothesis in humans proposed that human females release and receive pheromones that regulate the length of their menstrual cycles. This was assumed to occur without consciously detecting any odor. The study was conducted by collecting compounds from axillae (underarms) of donor women at prescribed phases during their menstrual cycles (i.e., the follicular phase, ovulatory phase, and luteal phase), and applying the compounds daily under the noses of recipient women. In order to collect the axillary compounds, the donor women wore cotton pads under their arms for at least 8 hours, and then the pads were cut into smaller squares, frozen to preserve the scent, and readied for distribution to the recipients. The recipients were split into two groups, and were exposed to the compounds via application of the thawed axillary pad under their noses daily. The researchers concluded that odorless compounds collected from women during the late follicular phase of their menstrual cycles triggered hormonal events that shortened the menstrual cycles of the recipient women, and that odorless compounds collected from women during the time of ovulation triggered a hormonal event in the recipient women that lengthened their menstrual cycles. Stern and McClintock concluded that these findings \"proved the existence of human pheromones\" as well as illustrated manipulation of the human menstrual cycle. Researchers pointed out several flaws in their study. Whitten's main critiques was with their using only their first cycles as a control for the subsequent conditions. He argued that this eliminate all within-subject variance. Control conditions should have been run between each experimental condition and not just at the beginning of the study. He was also skeptical about whether the coupled-oscillator model from rat research could be applied to humans. Perception and awareness of synchrony Arden and Dye investigated women's awareness and perception of menstrual synchrony. Their study consisted of 122 women (students and staff) at Leeds University . A four-page questionnaire was sent to each participant. After providing personal details, they were given a description of menstrual synchrony: \"Menstrual synchrony occurs when two or more women, who spend time with each other, have their periods at approximately the same time\" (p.\u00a0257). After reading the description they were asked whether they were aware of menstrual synchrony and whether they had experienced it. They were then asked details about their experience of synchrony such as how many times they experienced and how long it lasted. They found that 84% of the women were aware of the phenomenon of menstrual synchrony and 70% reported the personal experience of synchrony. The experience of synchrony occurred most commonly with close friends followed by roommates. There was considerable variation in the reported time spent together before synchrony occurred ranging from zero to four weeks to 12 months or more. The most common time was 12 months or more. The duration of menstrual synchrony also was highly variable with responses ranging from one to two months to 12 months or more. They conclude that \"Whether or not future research concludes that menstrual synchrony is an objective phenomenon, subjective experiences, which are apparently widespread, need to be given careful consideration.\" (p.\u00a0265) An illustration of menstrual cycle convergence and divergence as described in Yang and Schank. For illustration, A and B have menses duration of four days each. A has 28-day cycles and B has 30-day cycles. The first onset of B that appears is 14 days earlier than A' s. Red vertical lines indicate menses overlap or meet. In this example, cycles gradually converge and A and B may \"experience\" synchrony for five months. Both Wilson and Arden and Dye pointed out that menstrual synchrony can occur by chance when there is menstrual cycle variability. Yang and Schank argued that when there is cycle variability (i.e., either women have irregular cycles, have cycles of different frequencies, or both), most women will have the opportunity to experience synchrony even though it is a result of cycle variability and not a result of a mechanism such as the exchange of pheromones. For example, consider two women A and B . Suppose A has menstrual cycles that are 28 days long and B has cycles that are 30 days long. Suppose further that when A and B become close friends, B has a cycle onset 14 days before A' s next onset. The next time both of them have menstrual cycle onsets, B will have a cycle onset 12 days before A . B will continue to gain two days on A until their onsets coincide, then their cycles will begin to diverge again. The cycles of A and B will repeatedly converge and diverge creating the appearance of synchrony during convergence. This is a mathematical property of cycles of different frequencies and not due to the interaction of A and B . If, in addition, the duration of menstruation is considered (typically 3 to 5 days with a range of 2 to 7 days ), then the experience of synchrony may last a number of months. Strassmann argued menstrual synchrony defined as menstruation overlap should be quite common. For example, the expected difference by chance between two women with 28-day cycles\u2014which is approximately the average length of menstrual cycles of women at the age \u2014is 7 days. Considering that the mean duration of menses is 5 days and the range is 2 to 7 days, the probability of menstruation overlap by chance should be high. Adaptivity of menstrual synchrony Figure a . Females competing for good genes should avoid ovulatory synchrony. Moving from one female to the next, a single dominant male under these conditions can exercise a monopoly. Key : Circle = female. Pointer = ovulation. Triangle = male. Figure b . Females in need of male time and energy should synchronize their cycles, preventing any single male from monopolising access. In order to work out why menstrual synchrony might have evolved, it is necessary to investigate why individuals who synchronized their cycles might have had increased survival and reproduction in the evolutionary past. The relevant field in this case is behavioral ecology . In mammalian mating systems generally, and among primates in particular, female spatio-temporal distribution \u2013 how clumped females are in the environment and how much they overlap their fertile periods \u2013 affects the ability of any single male to monopolize matings. The basic principle is that the more females are fertile at any one time, the harder it is for any single male to monopolize access to them, impregnating all simultaneously at the expense of rival males. In the case of nonhuman primates, once the number of co-cycling females rises above a critical threshold, a harem-holder may be unable to prevent other males from invading and mating with his females. A dominant male can maintain his monopoly only if his females stagger their fertile periods, so that he can impregnate them one at a time (see figure a , right). Suppose a group of female baboons need between them just one dominant male, desirable in view of his high-quality genes. Then, logically, they should avoid synchronizing their cycles. By the same token, if males during the course of human evolution became valued by females for additional purposes \u2013 hunting and bringing home food, for example \u2013 then females should resist being controlled by dominant male harem-holders. If males are useful partners to have and keep around, then ideally each female should have at least one for herself. Under those circumstances, according to this argument, the logical strategy would be for females to synchronize as tightly as they can (see figure b , right). One implication is that there may be a link between the degree of synchrony in a population (whether seasonal, lunar or both), and the degree of reproductive egalitarianism among males. Foley and Fitzgerald objected to the idea that synchrony could have been a factor in human evolution on the grounds that for hominins with inter-birth intervals of 3\u20135 years, achieving synchrony was unrealistic. Infant mortality would disrupt synchrony since it would be too costly for a mother who had miscarried or lost her baby to wait until everyone else had weaned their babies and resumed cycling before having sex and getting pregnant herself. On the other hand, while conceding that it would be impossible to get clockwork synchrony throughout an inter-birth interval, Power et al. argued that once we take account of birth seasonality \u2013 enhancing the effects of menstrual synchrony by clumping fertile cycles within a relatively brief time-window \u2013 it emerges that reproductive synchrony can be effective as a female strategy to undermine primate-style sexual monopolization by dominant males. The controversy remains unresolved. Adopting a compromise position, one school of Darwinian thought sets out from the fact that the mean length of the human menstrual cycle is 29.3 days, which is strikingly close to the 29.5 day periodicity of the moon . It is suggested that the human female may once have had adaptive reasons for evolving such a cycle length \u2013 implying some theoretical potential for synchrony to a lunar clock \u2013 but did so in an African setting under prehistoric conditions which today no longer exist. Not all archaeologists accept that lunar periodicity was ever relevant to human evolution. On the other hand, according to Curtis Marean (head of excavations at the important Middle Stone Age site of Pinnacle Point , South Africa), anatomically modern humans around 165,000 years ago \u2013 when inland regions of the continent were dry, arid and uninhabitable \u2013 became restricted to small populations clustered around coastal refugia, reliant on marine resources including shellfish whose safe harvesting at spring low tides presupposed careful tracking of lunar phase. With gradual offshore platforms during spring low tides, substantial areas of the intertidal zone are revealed, and these are the most productive and safest shellfish collecting times\u2026 Foragers should schedule visits to coastal residential sites at times during the lunar month when spring tides are present and then move slightly inland during neaps to broaden the size of the exploitable terrestrial area. Olfactory influences on menstrual synchrony College students' menstrual periods can become synchronised when they live together as roommates, according to research by McClintock (McClintock, 1971). Since then, numerous investigations have supported the existence of menstrual synchronisation among women, including close friends, mothers and daughters, and coworkers [reviewed by Weller and Weller in 1993]. Women who spent the most time together were more likely to exhibit menstrual synchrony in each of these investigations. The axillary region's scents have been shown to be capable of mediating these effects (Preti et al., 1987; Russell et al., 1980; Stern and McClintock, 1998), but their active ingredients have not yet been discovered. The main olfactory system, which receives sensory inputs from the olfactory mucosa and connects to the rest of the central nervous system via the main olfactory bulbs, and the accessory system, which receives inputs from the vomeronasal organ and connects to other brain centres via the accessory olfactory bulbs, are the two olfactory systems that are present in the majority of mammals (Scalia and Winans, 1976). There are connections from the olfactory bulbs to the hypothalamus, the brain region in charge of regulating the release of luteinizing hormone, in both systems. In rats, the accessory system mediates the pheromonal action, [reviewed by Marchewska-Koj (Marchewska-Koj, in 1984)]. However, it appears that the pheromonal action in ewes and pigs is largely mediated via the primary olfactory system (Martin et al., 1986). (Dorries et al., 1997). If pheromones that mediate menstrual synchrony use the main olfactory system, a comparison of synchronised and non-synchronized women's ability to smell a particular pheromone can be used to infer a causal relationship between the ability to smell a pheromone and a potential role for the pheromone in mediating synchrony. In the current work, we looked at how menstrual synchrony and the sense of smell for the putative pheromones 3 androstenol and 5 androstenone related. Non-human species Estrous synchrony, a phenomenon similar to menstrual synchrony, has been reported in several other mammalian species. Menstrual or estrous synchrony has been reported in other species including Norway rats , hamsters , chimpanzees , and golden lion tamarins . In non-human primates, the term may also refer to the degree of overlap of menstrual or estrous cycles, which is the overlap of estrous or menses of two or more females in a group due, for example, to seasonal breeding . However, as with early human studies on menstrual synchrony, non-human estrous synchrony studies also were criticized for methodological problems. Subsequent studies failed to find estrous synchrony in rats, hamsters, chimpanzees, and golden lion tamarins. Rats McClintock also conducted a 1978 study of estrous synchrony in Norway rats ( Rattus norvegicus ). She reported that the estrous cycles of female rats living in groups of five were more regular than those of rats housed singly. She also reported that social interaction, and more importantly a shared air supply that allowed for olfactory communication enhanced the regularity of the rats' cycles and synchronized their estrous phases after two or three cycles. McClintock hypothesized that estrous synchrony was caused by pheromones and that a coupled oscillator mechanism produced estrous synchrony in rats This observation of menstrual synchrony in Norway rats is not the same as the Whitten effect because it was the result of the continuous interactions of ongoing cycles within a female group, rather than the result of an exposure to a single external stimulus such as male odor, which in the Whitten effect releases all exposed females simultaneously from an acyclic condition. The coupled-oscillator hypothesis asserted that females rats release two pheromone signals. One signal is released during the follicular phase of the estrous cycle and it shortens estrous cycles. The second signal is released during the ovulatory phase of the estrous cycle and it lengthens estrous cycles. When rats live together or share the same air supply, the pheromones released by each female in a group as a function of the phase of her estrous cycle causes other females in the group to either lengthen or shorten their estrous cycles. This mutual lengthening and shortening of estrous cycles was theorized to produce synchronization of estrous cycles over time. McClintock investigated the coupled oscillator hypothesis experimentally. She provided three groups of rats with airborne odors from female rats in three different phases of the estrous cycle: ovulatory phase, follicular phase, and luteal phase . She hypothesized that ovulatory phase odors would lengthen cycles, follicular phase odors would shorten cycles, and luteal phase odors would have no effect. Her results showed a lengthening of estrous cycles for females who received ovulatory odors, shortening of cycles for females who received follicular odors, and no effect for females who received luteal phase odors. The coupled-ocillator hypothesis was also investigated using a computer simulation model, which was compared with data from McClintock's 1978 study. They found that a coupled oscillator mechanism could produce estrous synchrony in female rats, but the effect was very weak. The proposed mechanisms of this model were more precisely tested by controlling the airborne odors received by individual females. They found support for the hypothesis that follicular phase odors short the length of estrous cycles, but they did not find that ovulatory phase odors lengthened cycles as the earlier study by McClintock had found. Schank conducted another experiment to test whether female rats could synchronize their cycles. He found that female rats did not synchronize their cycles and he argued that in the original McClintock study, the random control group was more asynchronous than expected by chance. When the experimental group was compared to the control group in McClintock's 1978 study, the experimental group was more synchronous than the control group but only because the control group was too asynchronous and not because the experimental group had synchronized their cycles. In a follow-up study, Schank again found no effect of estrous synchrony in rats. Hamsters In 1980, estrous synchrony was reported in female hamsters. In their study, hamsters were housed in four colony phase of the estrous cycle. They monitored and females in each room and removed the females that did not stay in phase. They placed a wire metal cage (i.e., condo consisting of four equally sized rectangular compartments) in the corner of each room. For each room, three animals were randomly selected and placed in three of the condo compartments. A fourth female was randomly selected from another room and placed in the remaining condo compartment. In the control condition, all four females placed in the condos came from the same room. Females were kept in the condos until all four animals exhibited 4 consecutive days of synchrony. They were then removed and a new group was formed until all combinations were tested. They found that the fourth female in the experimental condition always synchronized with the remaining three Their study was criticized as methodologically flawed because females were left together until the fourth female synchronized with the others. When female hamsters are subjected to the stress of stranger hamsters, their cycles become irregular. If only the female from another room's cycles change, then by chance, the longer the female is left with the other three, the more likely it is that she will synchronize by chance with the other three. In a follow-up experimental study motivated by this methodological critique, no evidence for estrous synchrony was found for female hamsters. Chimpanzees In 1985, estrous synchrony was reported in female chimpanzees. In her study, 10 female chimpanzees were caged, at different times, in two groups of four and six in the same building. The anogenital swelling of each female was recorded daily. Synchrony was measured by calculating the absolute differences in days between (1) the day of swelling onset and (2) the day of maximum swelling. She reported a statistically significant average difference of 5.7 days for onset of swelling and 8.0 days for maximum swelling. Schank, however, noted that due to females who became pregnant and who stopped cycling, most of the data were based on only four animals. He performed a computer simulation study to calculate the expected swelling onset and maximal swelling onset difference for female chimpanzees with the reported mean estrous cycle lengths of 36.7 (with a standard deviation of 4.3) days. He reported an expected difference of 7.7 days. Thus, a maximum swelling difference of 8.0 days is about what would be expected by chance and given that only four animals contributed data to the study, a 5.7 day onset difference is not significantly less than 7.7 days. Since then Matsumoto and colleagues have reported estrous asynchrony in groups of free-living chimpanzees in Mahale Mountains National Park , Tanzania . They subsequently investigated whether estrous asynchrony was adaptive for female chimpanzees. They tested three hypotheses about the adaptiveness of estrous asynchrony: (1) females become asynchronous to increase copulation frequency and opportunities for giving birth; (2) paternity confusion to reduce infanticide ; and (3) sperm competition . They found no support for hypothesis (1) and partial support for hypotheses (2) and (3). Golden lion tamarins A golden lion tamarin In 1987, estrous synchrony was reported in female golden lion tamarins by French and Stribley. Their subjects consisted of five adult female golden lion tamarins that were housed in two groups. Two females were housed with adult males and three females (a mother and two daughters) were housed with an adult male and infant male. They reported a 2.11 day difference in peak cycle estrogen for the two groups, which was less than the 4.5 day difference that they calculated would be the difference based on golden lion tamarins having a 19-day estrous cycle. Schank reanalyzed their study with the help of computer simulation and reported that a 2.11 day difference was not likely statistically significant. Monfort and colleagues conducted a study with eight females housed in pairs and found no evidence of synchrony. Mandrills Setchella, Kendala, and Tyniec investigated whether menstrual synchrony occurred in a semi-free-ranging population of mandrills of 10-group years. They reported that mandrills do not synchronize their menstrual cycles and concluded that cycle synchrony does not occur in non-human primates. Lions Oestrus synchrony has been reported of lions in the wild.

{"id": "doc_random_202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Guyana", "text": "Indigenous peoples in Guyana , Native Guyanese , Amerindian Guyanese , or First Nations are Guyanese people who are of Indigenous ancestry. They comprise approximately 9.16% of Guyana 's population. Amerindians are credited with the invention of the canoe , as well as Cassava-based dishes and Guyanese pepperpot , the national dish of Guyana. Amerindian languages have also been incorporated in the lexicon of Guyanese Creole . Customs and languages vary across the nations of Amerindians. Each group has a distinct language, although there is understanding between speakers of Pemon , Kap\u00f3ng , and Macushi . According to a survey conducted by the Inter-American Development Bank , only 20% of households were fluent in their own language, and higher fluency was related to longer distance from the capital. Caribs have been historically viewed as a warrior people, and while there is inter-tribal rivalry, much of what remains today was instigated during European colonization. A lack of writing system at the time of European contact has contributed to a wide array of spellings of group names; an example was the Warao , who had nearly 30 different variants according to early documents. Post-Columbian history Early interaction with the Dutch involved trade, or militia services such as hunting escaped slaves which continued on into the 1800s for the British. They were viewed by European colonial governments as protectors of the lands, or their borders, from claims by Spain and France. Amerindians themselves were also viewed as needing protection, leading to policies of missionization. Early land concessions and rights granted to appease Amerindians in order for European interests to survive in the Guianas eroded with the end of slavery and the growing viewpoint that Amerindians were benefiting by the civilizing force of European culture. Missions and schools were founded from various Christian societies, and these continue to play an important role in many contemporary communities. In 1899, the Hague tribunal to designate the border between British Guiana and Venezuela used evidence that by the accepting British sovereignty, the traditional lands of those tribes were thus a part of British Guiana. The Constitutional Conference of 1965 recognized the rights of Amerindians. Contrasting with the paternalistic missionary approach, integration and assimilation became more important in the 20th century. In 1976, an Indigenous Residence was opened in Georgetown to provide accommodation for hinterland people visiting Georgetown for educational, medical or other purposes. Titling is a key current issue for Indigenous communities, with encroachment on traditional lands for mining, logging, or other commercial uses. Court cases have presented problems with economic activity performed in adjacent lands affecting Amerindian communities, such as pollution of water supplies. Amerindians founded the Alleluia church , which combines Christian beliefs with Amerindian traditions.

{"id": "doc_random_205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Whittle", "text": "Brian Ian Whittle (born 26 April 1964) is a Scottish politician and former athlete, who has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the South Scotland region since 2016 . A member of the Scottish Conservatives , he serves as Shadow Minister for Environment, Biodiversity and Land Reform . Whittle won the gold medal in the 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay at both the 1986 European Athletics Championships and 1994 European Athletics Championships . He also competed at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul . Early life Whittle was born in 1964 growing up in the Scottish town of Troon . His father was a sprinter until his late teens. Whilst at school, Brian tried a wide range of sports, enjoying many of them but it was apparent that he had a natural talent for running. He has maintained that his talent lay in his discipline and ability to train. Brian Whittle was educated at Marr College in Troon and went on to read Chemistry at The University of Glasgow and Kilmarnock College . Athletic career At club level, Whittle ran for both Ayr Seaforth and Enfield & Haringey . His best performance in the 400 m was 45.22 at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul . He finished 1st in his heat, 3rd in the quarter-final, but did not progress past the semi-final. He ran 45.5 on the first leg of the 4 \u00d7 400 m relay (team \u2013 Whittle, Kriss Akabusi , Todd Bennett , Phil Brown ), but for once the GB team performed below par and finished fifth in the Olympic final. Perhaps his greatest achievement, and what he is best remembered for, is the manner in which he helped Great Britain win the gold medal in the 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay at the 1986 European Championships in Stuttgart. He ran the third leg of the race with one shoe, running a personal best leg time of 45.09. As he took the baton from Kriss Akabusi, Akabusi stood on his shoe and it ripped off, leaving him to run the race without it (thereafter the press nicknamed him 'One-shoe Whittle'). The other members of the team were Roger Black and Derek Redmond , all of whom ran Personal Best times on the day. Whittle also won a relay gold medal in the 1994 European Athletics Championships 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay team alongside David McKenzie , Roger Black, and Du'aine Ladejo . He also ran in the heats of the 4 \u00d7 400 m relay at the 1990 European Championships in Split. He moved to 800 m after the 1988 Olympic Games, and ran in the final of the 1990 Commonwealth Games 800 m in New Zealand, where he finished fourth ahead of Sebastian Coe and Tom McKean . Whittle ran the last leg of the Commonwealth Games 4 \u00d7 400 m in 1990, anchoring the Scottish Team to a silver medal. He ran 44.7 seconds for his leg. He also ran the 800 m in the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo. His personal best for 800 m was 1:45.47 in 1990. Other notable performances included running 45.98 at the 1988 European Indoor Championships in Budapest winning the silver medal \u2013 a feat he repeated in 1989. He ran the last leg of the winning 4 \u00d7 400 m relay in the Europa Cup in 1989 (Gateshead), helping Great Britain to win the team title for the first time. Whittle was an international schools' high jumper, and also competed in the 200 m at the 1986 Commonwealth Games , making the semi-final. His run of 45.98 seconds for the 400 metres indoors in Hungary in 1988 stood as the Scottish indoor record for 37 years until it was beaten by Brodie Young in February 2025. Political career Whittle contested the 2015 UK general election in the constituency of Kilmarnock and Loudoun for the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party , coming third with 12.5% of the vote. Member of the Scottish Parliament At the 2016 Scottish Parliament election , Whittle ran in the Kilmarnock and Irvine Valley constituency , where he increased the Conservatives' share of the vote to 19.2% (up by 8.8%), finishing third. He was one of two Conservatives to win election on the list for the South Scotland region . Whittle stood again in Kilmarnock and Irvine Valley at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election , where he took third place with 8,295 votes (20.4%). He was returned on the regional list. Controversy Whittle sparked a row over the two-child cap on tax credits by claiming \u201cthere is no such thing as a rape clause\u201d, claiming it was impossible to debate the controversial welfare reform as \u201cthe term rape clause is an invention to beat the Tories with\u201d. The remarks were widely condemned and described as \u201cskin-crawling\u201d by other parties. Personal life Whittle has three daughters.

Belarusian literature ( Belarusian : \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043bi\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 , romanized :\u00a0 Bie\u0142aruskaja litaratura ) is the writing produced, both prose and poetry , by speakers (not necessarily native speakers) of the Belarusian language . History Pre-17th century Belarusian literature was formed from the common basis of Kievan Rus' literary tradition, which also gave rise to Ukrainian literature and Russian literature . A separate literary tradition of Belarus became apparent only in the 14th\u201315th centuries, when together with Ukraine it developed the Ruthenian language , which would gradually diverge into northern (Belarusian) and southern (Ukrainian) varieties. The old Belarusian literature experienced its golden age in the 16th\u201317th centuries, when the Old Belarusian language was the official language of the Great Duchy of Lithuania . The Statutes of the Great Duchy of 1529, 1566 and 1588, as well as polemic religious literature were all published in Old Belarusian language. Since the early 16th century Belarusian literary works have been printed. The first printed Belarusian book (in the version of Old Belarusian) was Psaltyr, which was printed in Prague by Francysk Skaryna in 1517 (this was the first book to be printed in an East Slavonic language). Another well-known, influential work of that era was the Chronicle of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia and Samogitia . During the 16th and 17th century poetry and drama (see Simeon Polotsky ) appeared in Belarusian literature under the influence of a more developed Polish literature . 18th and 19th centuries Franci\u0161ak Bahu\u0161evi\u010d Due to the cultural dominance of the Polish language within the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Russian language within the Russian Empire , Belarusian language was used only occasionally in the 18th century literature, most notably by the dramatists Kajetan Moraszewski and Michal Ciecierski , who mixed Polish-speaking and Belarusian-speaking characters in their comedies. The literary renaissance began in the 19th century. Anonymous burlesque poems Inside-out Aeneid (1820s) and Taras on Parnassus (ca. 1855) appeared in circulation and were eventually published. Several works were contributed by local-born authors who also wrote in Polish ( Jan Barszczewski , Jan Czeczot , Vincent Dunin-Marcinkievi\u010d , Alaksandar Rypinski ). The second half of the 19th century saw the rise of Realism ( Franci\u0161ak Bahu\u0161evi\u010d , Adam Hurynovi\u010d , Janka \u0141u\u010dyna ). In the last quarter of the century multiple publications of Belarusian folklore appeared, notably the multi-volume collection by Je\u016ddakim Ramana\u016d . In this period, both Belarusian Latin alphabet and Cyrillic alphabet were actively used. Separately in Belarusian literature is the Polish-language work of Adam Mickiewicz . His work is often attributed to the \u201cBelarusian school\u201d of Polish-language literature\u2014representatives of this school, following Mickiewicz, wrote on the themes of the life of the Belarusian people, paying great attention to folklore. The influence of Mickiewicz can be traced in the works of Jan Barszczewski , W\u0142adys\u0142aw Syrokomla , Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich , Franci\u0161ak Bahu\u0161evi\u010d . Early 20th century A new period started after the 1905 Russian Revolution , when the first Belarusian-language newspapers were established in Vilnius ( Na\u0161a Dola and Na\u0161a Niva ). They brought together a circle of writers, who were arguing for developing the Belarusian language and its literature (including Janka Kupa\u0142a , Maksim Bahdanovi\u010d , \u0179mitrok Biadula , Maksim Harecki , Jakub Ko\u0142as ). The Belarusian literature of the time combined elements of Romanticism, Realism and Modernism. World War I During World War I and the proclamation of the Belarusian People's Republic (1918), the key themes within the Belarusian literature were patriotism and common life . Interwar period After the establishment of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (BSSR) in 1919, literary life in Belarus was concentrated around the magazines Ma\u0142adniak (1923\u20131928) and Uzvy\u0161\u0161a (1926\u20131931), which were published by a group of Belarusian writers . Besides the authors from the previous periods ( \u0179mitrok Biadula , Jakub Ko\u0142as ), this was a period of active work of poets Micha\u015b \u010carot , U\u0142adzimier Dubo\u016dka , Petro Glebka , Ale\u015b Dudar , and writers Maksim Harecki , Ci\u0161ka Hartny , Jurka Vi\u0107bi\u010d and Ku\u017ama \u010corny . Outside of Belarus, Belarusian literature developed as well\u2014in Vilnius , Kaunas , Prague ( Micha\u015b Ma\u0161ara , Kazimier Svajak ). In 1934, the Union of Writers of BSSR was established in Minsk . The tradition of socialist realism appeared in the 1930s. Many writers perished in the 1937 mass execution of Belarusians . Post-war period After the end of the World War II , the key themes for the new Belarusian literature were war time experiences, the life of Belarusians in the Soviet Union and national history (in particular, novels by Ivan Miele\u017e and Ivan \u0160amiakin ) . Since the 1960s a new theme of morality appeared in the Belarusian prose . Many writers have been fighting for freedom of speech for the authors (in particular, Vasil Byka\u016d and U\u0142adzimier Karatkievi\u010d ). There are several Belarusian authors who have left Belarus and now work in emigration (for instance, Natalla Arsie\u0144nieva and Ale\u015b Sa\u0142aviej ). Among leading literary magazines of Belarus are Litaratura i mastactva (since 1932) and Po\u0142ymia (since 1922). Svetlana Alexievich was awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Literature. In 2015, Belarusian investigative journalist and prose writer Svetlana Alexievich was awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for her polyphonic writings, a monument to suffering and courage in our time\".

{"id": "doc_random_209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "text": "This article is about the horse racing track in New York. For other uses, see Belmont Park (disambiguation) . Belmont Park is a Thoroughbred horse racetrack in Elmont, New York , just east of New York City limits best known for hosting the Belmont Stakes , the final leg of the American Triple Crown . It was opened on May 4, 1905, and is one of the most well known racetracks in the United States. The original structure was demolished in 1963, and a second facility opened in 1968. The second structure was demolished in 2024, and a third version of Belmont Park is expected to open in 2026. Operated by the New York Racing Association (NYRA), Belmont Park is typically open for racing from late April through mid-July (known as the Spring meet), and again from mid-September through late October (the Fall meet). The race park's main dirt track has earned the nickname, \"the Big Sandy\", given its prominent overall dimensions ( 1 + 1 \u2044 2 miles (2.4\u00a0km)) and the deep, sometimes tiring surface. Belmont is also sometimes known as \"The Championship Track\" because almost every major champion in racing history since the early 20th century has competed on the racecourse \u2013 including all of the Triple Crown winners. Belmont Park, with its large, wide, sweeping turns and long homestretch, is considered one of the fairest racetracks in America. Belmont hosted its largest crowd at the 2004 Belmont Stakes , when 120,139 spectators saw Smarty Jones upset by Birdstone in his Triple Crown bid. History First Belmont Park (1903\u20131963) Belmont Park Clubhouse and Grandstand in 1905 August Belmont Jr. and William Collins Whitney , along with other investors, built the original Belmont race track, which opened on May 4, 1905. Arthur Underhill was hired as Engineer and Landscape Architect to design and oversee construction of the park. In its first 15 or so years, Belmont Park featured racing clockwise, in the \"English fashion\"\u2014allowing the upper-class members of the racing association and their guests to have the races finish in front of the clubhouse, just to the west of the grandstand. A \"field stand,\" at what was then the top of the stretch, was located east of the grandstand. The original finish line was located at the top of the present-day homestretch. In his 1925 book, \"The Big Town\", Ring W. Lardner refers to the then-recent directional change when he has a character at Belmont say (speaking of a recent race) \"At that time, they run the wrong way of the track, like you would deal cards\". A later innovation was created by Joseph E. Widener , who took over track leadership when August Belmont II died in 1924: the Widener Chute. It was a straightaway of just under 7 furlongs (1.4\u00a0km) that cut diagonally through Belmont's training and main tracks, hitting near the quarter-pole of the main track; the course was removed in 1958. A crowd watching seven planes in the air at the Belmont Park air show, New York on October 30, 1910 Glenn Curtiss monoplane at Belmont Park meet with Eugene Burton Ely at wheel, year 1910 (courtesy New York Public Library archives) Two features of the original Belmont Park remain today. The first is the display of four stone pillars on Hempstead Turnpike , a gift from the mayor and park commissioners of Charleston, South Carolina . The pillars had stood at the entrance of the Washington Course of the South Carolina Jockey Club in Charleston, which operated from 1792 to 1882. The stone pillars are now found at the clubhouse entrance. Lesser known but more visible are the racing motif iron railings seen partially bordering the walking ring. The railings, used as decoration on the south side of the old Belmont grandstand, were salvaged during the 1963 demolition. The original Belmont Park was not only unprecedented in its size but also had the then-new innovation of a Long Island Rail Road extension from the Queens Village station, running along the property, tunneling under Hempstead Turnpike , then terminating on the south side of the property. The train terminal was moved to its present location north of the turnpike after the 1956 season. Near the railroad terminal was yet another track\u2014Belmont Park Terminal, a steeplechase course operated by United Hunts until 1927. The last race at the old Belmont Park was run in October 1962. In spring 1963, NYRA Chairman James Cox Brady announced that two separate engineering surveys found the grandstand/clubhouse was unsafe due to age-induced structural defects and needed to be rebuilt. The book Belmont Park: A Century of Champions noted the comment of NYRA President Edward T. Dickinson: \"When you sighted down the stands, you could see some of the beams were twisted. They were in something of an S-shape.\" The old structure was demolished in 1963, along with the Manice Mansion, the turreted 19th-century homestead that served as the headquarters of Belmont's Turf and Field Club. Aviation meets In addition to racing history, Belmont Park made history in another industry native to the Hempstead Plains \u2013 aviation . Some 150,000 people were drawn to the track on October 30, 1910, at the climax of a Wright Brothers -staged International Aviation Meet at Belmont Park , which had started eight years earlier. The event came at the beginning of a period from 1910 to 1912 in which racing was outlawed in New York State. Eight years later, Belmont and aviation were reunited when the racetrack served as the northern point of the first U.S. air mail route, between the New York area and Washington, D.C. Exterior and tote board in 1999. The tote board was later changed to a digital tote and TV display. Second Belmont Park (1968\u20132024) The Belmont race meetings were moved to Aqueduct Racetrack in South Ozone Park , Queens from 1963 to 1968. During this period, the second grandstand was built and the Inner Turf Course was also added. The $30.7 million grandstand, designed by Arthur Froehlich , was opened May 20, 1968, and was the largest in Thoroughbred racing. It had a total attendance capacity of more than 100,000, including a seating capacity of 33,000 and an adjoining backyard being able to accommodate more than 10,000. A long mural by Pierre Bellocq on the second floor of the clubhouse featuring the dominant jockeys, trainers and racing personalities celebrates the track's history. In May 2007, New York Governor Eliot Spitzer considered closing Aqueduct Racetrack located ten miles west of Belmont in Ozone Park, New York , and turning Belmont into a nearly year-round race track when the New York Racing Association lease for all three of New York State's tracks expired at the end of 2007. Belmont's stands would have been heated, additional barns built for Aqueduct's 400 horses, and the track modified to accommodate winter racing. In addition, video lottery machines would have been introduced. A new entity would have operated Belmont from fall to spring while the New York Racing Association would continue to operate Saratoga Race Course in the summer. Spitzer was forced to resign amid a prostitution scandal in March 2008 and no further plans for Belmont were developed at that time. In December 2022, the New York Racing Association formally announced its intention to upgrade the facilities at Belmont to make it suitable to host year-round thoroughbred racing and training. Unlike Churchill and Pimlico , neither the first nor second iterations of Belmont Park allowed spectators into the infield. An infield tunnel connecting to the backstretch parking lot has been completed. Beginning in April 2023 construction of a one-mile synthetic racing oval inside the inner turf course had begun. The next phase of reconstruction, which began after the 2023 spring and summer meet, included completion of the synthetic track, widening of the inner turf course, and construction of a second infield tunnel near the first turn. NYRA released a statement on May 1, 2023, announcing that state funding for the grandstand reconstruction and other projects had been secured by way of a $455 million loan.

UBS Arena See also: UBS Arena Belmont Park and UBS Arena in 2021 In July 2017, New York State officials announced that vacant parking lots behind the Belmont grandstand had been put to tender for two area top-level professional sports teams: the New York Islanders , an NHL ice hockey team; and New York City FC , an MLS soccer team. Both teams were unhappy with their current locations (the Islanders at Barclays Center ; New York City FC at Yankee Stadium ) and proposed to redevelop the land into their own stadiums. The Islanders proposed an 18,000 seat sports arena , 435,000 square feet (40,400\u00a0m 2 ) for retail development, a 225-room hotel, and a 10,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (930\u00a0m 2 ) community center, while NYCFC's pledge included a 26,000 seat soccer ground, 400,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (37,000\u00a0m 2 ) for retail, a 5.2-acre (2.1\u00a0ha) community park, and 2-acre (0.81\u00a0ha) soccer complex: both proposals were fully privately funded and included improved parking and LIRR facilities as well. On December 20, 2017, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the Islanders project had won approval to be built. In July 2019, the plan was adopted by the Empire State Development Corporation board, and UBS Arena opened in time for the 2021-22 NHL season . The plan also included a new Elmont station on the LIRR, in addition to the hotel, arena, and Belmont Park Village . Third Belmont Park (under construction; 2026 opening planned) By July 2024, the second Belmont Park was completely demolished with reconstruction planned until September 2026. The new grandstand, when finished, will hold the October 2027 Breeders' Cup , the first Breeder's Cup at Belmont since 2005. To accommodate construction, NYRA moved the Belmont fall meet to Aqueduct from 2022 to 2025. The 2024 Belmont Stakes and 2025 Belmont Stakes were moved to Saratoga Race Course due to the construction, and the 2026 Belmont Stakes is planned for Saratoga as well, although the option of holding that year's race at Belmont Park had been discussed previously. By February 2025, the foundation for the new grandstand had been poured. By May 2025, pouring for the concrete and steel shell of the new grandstand was underway. The outlines for the new dirt, turf and synthetic courses had been set, with plans for the turf courses to be of shorter circumference and the finish line moved forward by 125 feet compared to previous course configurations. The new Belmont Park facility is planned to open in September 2026, which would ultimately lead to the closure of nearby Aqueduct Racetrack . Physical attributes Horses race down the stretch on Belmont Park's main track, nicknamed \"Big Sandy\" by owners, trainers, jockeys and fans. The main track is the longest dirt racecourse in North American thoroughbred racing\u2014at 1 + 1 \u2044 2 miles (2.4\u00a0km). The 430-acre (170\u00a0ha) racing, training and barn complex is located on the western edge of the Nassau County region known as the Hempstead Plains. Just a few miles (kilometers) east on the same plains, the first racing meet in North America was held in 1665, supervised by colonial governor Richard Nicolls. The dirt racecourse, known officially as the Main Track and nicknamed \"Big Sandy\" by racing followers, has a circumference of 1 + 1 \u2044 2 miles (2.4\u00a0km), the longest dirt thoroughbred racetrack in North America. Immediately inside of this is the Widener Turf Course (named after the Widener family that has a long and prestigious history in American horse racing) spanning 1 + 5 \u2044 16 miles (2.1\u00a0km) plus 27 feet (8.2\u00a0m), which in turn encircles an Inner Turf Course with a circumference of 1 + 3 \u2044 16 miles (1.9\u00a0km) plus 103 feet (31\u00a0m). On the Main Track, it is 1,097 feet (334\u00a0m) from the top of the stretch to the finish line, and the segment between the wire and the start of the first (clubhouse) turn covers 843 feet (257\u00a0m); this latter segment is shorter by approximately 165 feet (50\u00a0m) on both of the turf courses, in order to accommodate the two chutes that exist on the Widener Turf Course, from which turf races of 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) and 1 + 1 \u2044 16 miles (1.7\u00a0km) are started; an additional chute exists for races of 1 + 1 \u2044 16 miles (1.7\u00a0km) on the Inner Turf Course. NYRA bugler Sam Grossman plays \"Call to the Post\", heralding the horses as they enter the track before a race at Belmont Park. A straightaway chute leads on to the backstretch of the Main Track and permits races on the dirt up to 1 + 1 \u2044 8 miles (1.8\u00a0km) long to be run with one turn. The chute used to extend further back across the training track, permitting races of up to a mile and a quarter but was shortened because a crossover is now infeasible given the clay base of the Main Track and stone-dust base of the training track. Before the 1990 Breeders' Cup, the outer rail of the Main Track was moved back to widen the middle of the clubhouse turn and soften the angle of the start of the 1 + 1 \u2044 4 miles (2.0\u00a0km) Classic . The training track is 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) in circumference and abuts the east end of the main track. In March 2009, lights were added to the training track as a safety measure to prevent early morning workouts from occurring in the dark. Geopolitical status Belmont Park class=notpageimage| Location in Nassau County, New York , just outside New York City. The racetrack, grandstand, training, and barn facilities are located entirely in the community of Elmont in Nassau County, New York . According to the City of New York's own map portal, the Long Island Rail Road station on the property, the ramp between the grandstand and the train station, and some of the adjoining parking fields straddle the Queens County line. Belmont Park has direct on- and off-ramps to the Cross Island Parkway , which runs north\u2013south and is just to the west of the park. Belmont Park's physical address is given as 2150 Hempstead Turnpike ( New York State Route 24 ). The Belmont Park property originally totaled some 650 acres (260\u00a0ha). After the 1956 season, the construction of a wider bus road beyond the main course's final turn forced the turn to be shortened. According to the Belmont publication commemorating the track's 1968 reopening, that move cut 96 feet (29\u00a0m) off its circumference. The current layout has the entire racing course inside Nassau County. Racing Belmont Stakes The Belmont Stakes was named after financier and sportsman August Belmont Sr. , who helped fund the race, and most sources say the racetrack itself was also named for him. The race was first run in 1867 at Jerome Park Racetrack in the Bronx. In 1937, the wrought iron gates that bore an illustration of that first Belmont Stakes were donated to Belmont Park by August Belmont II's sole surviving son, Perry Belmont. The gates were located on the fourth floor of Belmont Park's clubhouse until the 2024 demolition. A statue of Secretariat stands in the middle of the walking ring The Belmont Stakes races have been run at Belmont Park since 1905, with the exceptions of 1911\u201312, when gambling was banned in New York State; the 1963\u201367 editions, held at Aqueduct while the grandstands at Belmont Park were reconstructed; and the 2024/2025 editions, which was held at Saratoga Race Course due to the second reconstruction of Belmont Park. Secretariat 's finishing time in his 1973 Belmont victory (2 minutes, 24 seconds) set a world record for 1 + 1 \u2044 2 miles (2.4\u00a0km) on dirt, a world record which still stands. The 31-length victory clinched the first Triple Crown in 25 years, dating back to Citation in 1948 . A statue of Secretariat is in the center of the Belmont paddock. Another Belmont Stakes achievement is recognized by the \"Woody's Corner\" display that was located in the first-floor clubhouse lobby, commemorating the five consecutive Belmont Stakes winners trained by Woody Stephens from 1982 to 1986. The racetrack was also the site of Affirmed 's epic stretch duel with Alydar in the 1978 Belmont Stakes , a victory that gave Affirmed the Triple Crown; and Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew 's defeat of Affirmed in the Marlboro Cup in September of that same year. The Marlboro, a key event of the Fall Championship meets in the 1970s and 1980s, included a dramatic come-from-behind win by Forego in the 1976 installment. The \"Woody's Corner\" display in the first-floor clubhouse lobby of the 2nd Belmont Park (1968\u20132024) commemorated the five consecutive Belmont Stakes winners trained by Woody Stephens from 1982 to 1986. Officials of the New York Racing Association made a concerted effort to boost attendance on Belmont Stakes Day after the 1995 installment drew only 37,171. The 2000 and 2001 Belmonts\u2014both run when there was no Triple Crown on the line\u2014drew announced crowds of 67,810 and 73,857. In 2004 , a record attendance of 120,139 was on hand to see if Smarty Jones would be the first Triple Crown winner since 1978. American Pharoah won the 2015 Belmont Stakes on June 6, and became the first Triple Crown winner in 37 years. It was announced before the race that attendance would be capped at 90,000. That year's Kentucky Derby and Preakness both set attendance records, over 170,000 and 130,000 respectively. Other key races at Belmont In addition to the Belmont Stakes, other major races held at Belmont have included the Jockey Club Gold Cup , the Suburban Handicap and the Memorial Day standby\u2014the Metropolitan Handicap , also known as the \"Met Mile.\" An important race for fillies, the Acorn Stakes , which is the first leg of the US Triple Tiara , is raced at the track year. All of the above races are contested on dirt; notable turf (grass) races include the Belmont Derby , Belmont Oaks , Manhattan Handicap , Just A Game Handicap , Bowling Green Handicap , Man O' War Stakes , Flower Bowl Invitational Stakes and the Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Invitational . Belmont's Fall Championship meet includes New York Showcase Day in late October, with seven stakes races for New York-bred horses. The richest race on that program is the $250,000 Empire Classic Handicap . Other memorable performances in Belmont Park history include the opening of the track in 1905 with the famous dead heat between Sysonby and Race King in the Met Cap . In 1923, Belmont Park was host to an international duel between the American and English champions: Zev , winner of the Kentucky Derby , against Papyrus, winner of The Derby . Zev won by five lengths in front of an estimated crowd of 70,000. Belmont Park was the site of the tragedy-marred victory of Foolish Pleasure over champion filly Ruffian in a 1975 match race. Ruffian broke down during the race and had to be euthanized. She was buried near the finish line in the infield at Belmont Park, her nose pointed towards the finish pole, from 1975 until 2023. Graded events The following Graded events were held at Belmont at the Big A in 2025. Grade I Acorn Stakes Belmont Derby Belmont Oaks Belmont Stakes Champagne Stakes Frizette Stakes Jaipur Invitational Stakes Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Just a Game Stakes Manhattan Stakes Ogden Phipps Stakes Metropolitan Handicap New York Stakes Woody Stephens Stakes Grade II Bed O' Roses Invitational Stakes Beldame Stakes Belmont Gold Cup Invitational Stakes Brooklyn Invitational Stakes Gallant Bloom Handicap Hill Prince Stakes Kelso Handicap Knickerbocker Stakes Man o' War Stakes Miss Grillo Stakes Mother Goose Stakes Ruffian Handicap Sheepshead Bay Stakes Suburban Stakes True North Stakes Wonder Again Stakes Woodward Stakes Grade III Athenia Stakes Beaugay Stakes Bold Ruler Handicap Dwyer Stakes Fort Marcy Stakes Futurity Stakes Intercontinental Stakes Jockey Club Derby Jockey Club Oaks John A.

Meets Horses and lead ponies in a pre-race post parade at Belmont. Before the 2024 reconstruction, racing at Belmont Park was conducted in two annual installments, or \"meetings\". The \"spring-summer meeting\" usually began on the Thursday or Friday of the week before the Kentucky Derby in April and lasts through the first or second Sunday in July, depending on the start of the Saratoga meet that follows. The Saratoga meet was expanded to eight weeks in 2019. The \"fall meeting\" follows the Saratoga season, commencing on the Thursday or Friday after Labor Day and ending on either the last Sunday in October or in some years the first Sunday in November, usually dependent on the dates of the Breeders' Cup. Racing is held at Saratoga Race Course , during the time between these two meetings. Prior to 1977, a summer meeting was contested at Aqueduct from mid-June until the Saratoga meet began; its abolition led to the Belmont spring meeting being lengthened to its present duration. The autumn installment is known as the Fall Championship meet, since many of the eventual Eclipse Award title winners have earned key victories in some of the meeting's races, such as the Jockey Club Gold Cup . Belmont has been home to the day-long Breeders' Cup championship in 1990, 1995, 2001 and most recently in 2005. Belmont's backyard is well known as a gathering place for racing fans to see their horses saddled before they hit the track. The center of the paddock is dominated by a white pine that pre-dated the track itself\u2014it turned 180 years old in 2006. Belmont track announcers Because of Belmont's role in hosting big, nationally televised races on broadcast and cable TV, its track announcers have been among the best known in the sport. Among the famous race callers who've served as Belmont PA announcers are: Fred Capossela (1940\u20131971) Dave Johnson (1972\u20131977) - Contrary to popular belief, Johnson, not Anderson, was Belmont Park's PA announcer during Secretariat's 1973 romp in the Belmont Stakes. There is no known audio to exist of Johnson's call of that Belmont. It was on TV that Anderson called the 1973 Belmont Stakes aired by CBS Television, where he famously described Big Red as \"moving like a tremendous machine\". Chic Anderson (1977\u20131979) Marshall Cassidy (1979\u20131990) Tom Durkin (1990\u20132014) Larry Collmus (2014\u20132020) John Imbriale (2020\u20132023) In popular culture Belmont Park has been featured in the following: Comedy Comedian Robert Klein made Capossella's race calls the subject of one of his routines, captured on his 1974 album Mind Over Matter. Film Scenes for the Woody Allen movies Mighty Aphrodite (1995) and Melinda and Melinda (2004) were shot at Belmont Park, as was a paddock scene for the 1990s remake of the film Gloria with Sharon Stone and George C. Scott . Scenes for the movie St. Vincent (2014) starring Bill Murray were shot at Belmont Park. Belmont Park was one of the racetracks referred to in the song \"It's A Simple Little System\" in the Judy Holliday - Dean Martin musical Bells Are Ringing . (The code name assigned to it was \"Beethoven.\") Music Belmont has hosted some concerts over the years including Natalie Cole (1979), Blondie (1979) and the Goo Goo Dolls (2015). Television A January 1975 episode in season 5 of the ABC sitcom The Odd Couple \u2014 entitled \"Felix the Horse Player\"\u2014was filmed partly at Belmont Park, though one of the race clips on the show features the shot of an Aqueduct starting gate. A few years later, Dick Cavett took the camera crew of his PBS talk show to Belmont for a look at horse racing. In November 2004, Belmont Park was featured in an episode of the ninth season of Everybody Loves Raymond , titled Boys' Therapy , in which Frank, Robert, and Ray bet on a horse named \"Marie's Mouth\". In 2015, Belmont Park was featured on the season finale of The Amazing Race 27 . See also American Triple Crown Graded stakes race References ^ \"Belmont\" . www.nyra.com .

{"id": "doc_random_210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyubov_Popova", "text": "Lyubov Sergeyevna Popova ( Russian : \u041b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0301\u0432\u044c \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0301\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0301\u0432\u0430 ; 24 April 1889 \u2013 25 May 1924) was a Russian-Soviet avant-garde artist , painter and designer . Early life Popova was born in Ivanovskoe , near Moscow , to the wealthy family of Sergei Maximovich Popov, a very successful textile merchant and vigorous patron of the arts, and Lyubov Vasilievna Zubova, who came from a highly cultured family. Lyubov Sergeyevna had two brothers and a sister: Sergei was the eldest, then Lyubov, Pavel and Olga. Pavel became a philosopher and the guardian of his sister's artistic legacy. Popova grew up with a strong interest in art, especially Italian Renaissance painting. At eleven years old she began formal art lessons at home. She was first enrolled in Yaltinskaia's Women's Gymnasium, then in Arseneva's Gymnasium in Moscow. By the age of 18 she was studying with Stanislav Zhukovsky , and in 1908 entered the private studios of Konstantin Yuon and Ivan Dudin . Between 1912 and 1913, she began attending the studios of the Cubist painters Henri Le Fauconnier and Jean Metzinger at Acad\u00e9mie de La Palette in Paris. Career Travels Popova traveled widely to investigate and learn from diverse styles of painting, but it was the ancient Russian icons , the paintings of Giotto , and the works of the 15th- and 16th-century Italian painters which interested her the most. In 1909 she traveled to Kiev , then in 1910 to Pskov and Novgorod . The following year she visited other ancient Russian cities, including St. Petersburg , to study icons. In 1912 she worked in a Moscow studio known as \"The Tower\" with Ivan Aksenov and Vladimir Tatlin , and also visited Sergei Shchukin 's collection of modern French paintings. In 1912\u20131913 she studied art with Nadezhda Udaltsova in Paris , where she met Alexander Archipenko , and Ossip Zadkine in 1913. After returning to Russia that same year, she worked with Tatlin, Udaltsova, and the Vesnin brothers . In 1914 she traveled in France and Italy during the development of Cubism and Futurism . Style Cubo-Futurism The Model , 1913 The Pianist , 1914, National Gallery of Canada Popova was one of the first female pioneers in Cubo-Futurism . Through a synthesis of styles she worked towards what she termed painterly architectonics . After first exploring Impressionism , by 1913, in Composition with Figures , she was experimenting with the particularly Russian development of Cubo-Futurism: a fusion of two equal influences from France and Italy. From 1914 to 1915 her Moscow home became the meeting-place for artists and writers. In 1914\u20131916 Popova together with other avant-garde artists ( Aleksandra Ekster , Nadezhda Udaltsova, Olga Rozanova ) contributed to the two Knave of Diamonds exhibitions, in Petrograd Tramway V and the 0.10 , The Store in Moscow. An analysis of Popova's cubo-futurist work also suggests an affinity with the work of Fernand Leger , whose geometry of tubular and conical forms in his series of paintings from 1913 to 1914 is similar to that in Popova's paintings. Suprematism Her painting The Violin of 1914 suggests the development from Cubism towards the \"painterly architectonics\" series of 1916\u20131918. This series defined her distinct artistic trajectory in abstract form. The canvas surface is an energy field of overlapping and intersecting angular planes in a constant state of potential release of energy. At the same time the elements are held in a balanced and proportioned whole as if linking the compositions of the classical past to the future. Color is used as the iconic focus; the strong primary color at the center drawing the outer shapes together. Portrait of a Philosopher (Artist's brother, Pavel Sergeyevich Popov), 1915 In 1916 she joined the Supremus group with Kazimir Malevich , the founder of Suprematism , Aleksandra Ekster , Ivan Kliun , Nadezhda Udaltsova , Olga Rozanova , Ivan Puni , Nina Genke , Ksenia Boguslavskaya and others who at this time worked in Verbovka Village Folk Centre . The creation of a new kind of painting was part of the revolutionary urge of the Russian avant-garde to remake the world. The term 'supreme' refers to a 'non-objective' or abstract world beyond that of everyday reality. However, there was a tension between those who, like Malevich, saw art as a spiritual quest, and others who responded to the need for the artist to create a new physical world. Popova embraced both of these ideals but eventually identified herself entirely with the aims of the Revolution working in poster , book design , fabric and theatre design, as well as teaching. At 0.10 she had exhibited a number of figurative painted cardboard reliefs in a cubist derived style. In 1916 she began to paint completely abstract Suprematist compositions, but the title \"Painterly Architectonics\" (which she gave to many of her paintings) suggests that, even as a Suprematist, Popova was more interested in painting as a projection of material reality than as the personal expression of a metaphysical reality. Popova's superimposed planes and strong color have the objective presence of actual space and materials. In 1918 Popova married the art historian Boris von Eding , and gave birth to a son. Von Eding died the following year of typhoid fever . Popova was also seriously ill but recovered. Constructivism As early as 1917, in parallel with her Suprematist work, the artist had made fabric designs and worked on Agitprop books and posters, In the Tenth State Exhibition: Non Objective Creativity and Suprematism , 1918, she contributed the architectonic series of paintings. She continued painting advanced abstract works until 1921. In the 5x5=25 Exhibition of 1921, Popova and her four fellow Constructivists declared that easel painting was to be abandoned and all creative work was to be for the people and the making of the new society. Popova worked in a broad range of mediums and disciplines, including painting, relief, works on paper, and designs for the theater, textiles, and typography. Popova did not join the Working Group of Constructivists when it was set up in Moscow in March 1921, but joined by the end of 1921. In 1923 she began creating designs for fabric to be manufactured by the First State Textile Printing Works in Moscow. From 1921 to 1924 Popova became entirely involved in Constructivist projects, sometimes in collaboration with Varvara Stepanova , the architect Alexander Vesnin and Alexander Rodchenko . She produced stage designs: Vsevolod Meyerhold 's production of Fernand Crommelynck 's The Magnanimous Cuckold , 1922; her Spatial Force Constructions were used as the basis of her art teaching theory at Vkhutemas . She designed typography of books, production art and textiles, and contributed designs for dresses to LEF . She worked briefly in the Cotton Printing Factory in Moscow with Varvara Stepanova. Death and legacy Popova died at the peak of her artistic powers two days after the death of her son, from whom she had contracted scarlet fever in 1924 in Moscow. A large exhibition of her work opened in Moscow from 21 December 1924 to January 1925, at Stroganov Institute , Moscow. The exhibition included Popova's works such as seventy-seven paintings, as well as books, posters, textile designs, and line engravings. \"Artist-Constructor\" was the term applied to Popova by her contemporaries in the catalogue of the artist's posthumous exhibition. Popova was the subject of an exhibition at the Museo de Arte Abstracto Espa\u00f1ol , Cuenca (18 February - 23 May 2004) and Museu Fundaci\u00f3n Juan March , Palma (4 June - 4 September 2004) of works created from 1910 to 1922 and loaned from the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow. Rodchenko/Popova: Defining Constructivism , an exhibition of the work of Popova, Rodchenko, and other Constructivists was shown at Tate Modern , London, in 2009, and subsequently at Museo Reina Sofia , Madrid.

{"id": "doc_random_211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_Horrors", "text": "Savage Horrors: The Intrinsic Raciality of the American Gothic is a 2020 academic monograph by German literary scholar, author, and academic Corinna Lenhardt. The book was published by transcript publishing, and is part of its American Culture Studies series . Lenhardt covers the role of race in American Gothic literature, from its roots in British Romanticism to more recent works. The author identifies a recurring \"Savage Villain/Civil Hero\" motif in White Anglo-Saxon Protestant writing and shows how African American authors addressed and adapted this motif in their own texts. Summary The book investigates how racial constructs have shaped American Gothic literature from its British roots through contemporary U.S. fiction. In this work, Lenhardt identifies what she describes as an intrinsic raciality embedded in the genre's core binary structures, focusing on the enduring presence of the \"Savage Villain/Civil Hero Gotheme.\" She traces how this framework emerged in early British Gothic, evolved in White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) American contexts, and was subsequently engaged, adapted, and challenged by African American writers in ways that highlight both systemic oppression and literary resistance. The book begins with an introduction that outlines the scope of the study and situates the Gothic as a transnational phenomenon with distinctive \"British origins.\" It then divides its discussion into three parts. Part I defines the Gothic and explores the early British development of the Savage Villain/Civil Hero motif. Part II examines how this motif appeared in early WASP American Gothic and continued in more recent American texts, illustrating iterative patterns over time. Part III demonstrates how African American authors engaged with and reworked this motif, discussing the concept's appearance in Black writing from the late eighteenth century onward. An epilogue concludes the volume by reflecting on the relationship between raciality and American Gothic, proposing possibilities for rethinking entrenched discursive binaries. Reviews In his review, German American studies scholar Dustin Breitenwischer pointed out that Lenhardt made a sweeping claim: the Gothic is inescapably racialized. He commended her coverage of both historical and modern American texts. He noted her focus on White authors who perpetuated racial tropes and Black authors who subverted them. He highlighted her extensive theoretical framework but observed that it sometimes slowed the reading process. He wrote that Lenhardt's study \"confronts and challenges the established genre, traditional aesthetic, and cultural communication of the U. S. American Gothic with an overdue critique of its foundational vices.\" He mentioned that the book's dissertation-like structure created a detailed but occasionally laborious read. He indicated that Lenhardt's argument would be highly valuable for those studying American literature and critical race theory. Albina Vladimirovna Skisova found Lenhardt's book notable for its broad coverage and detailed analyses. Skisova saw Lenhardt's main argument as the claim that all Gothic literature, especially American, is inherently racialized. She appreciated the author's examination of both White and African American Gothic texts from the eighteenth century to the present. However, Skisova questioned the universality of Lenhardt's claim that all Gothic literature is necessarily shaped by race. She suggested that focusing primarily on Black and White reduces the complexity of American Gothic. She concluded that while the monograph is valuable and wide-ranging, its argument may be too general in asserting that \"American Gothic\" should be subdivided strictly on racial lines. Irina Golovacheva's review discussed Lenhardt's emphasis on race as central to American Gothic. She showed how Lenhardt views the \"Savage Villain / Civilized Hero\" motif as universal in American texts. She noted Lenhardt's argument that American Gothic did not merely import British motifs. Rather, it acquired new racial meanings in the New World. She also highlighted the idea that African American writers were using Gothic elements as early as Olaudah Equiano. She pointed out that Lenhardt views Gothic as a fluid strategy rather than a strict genre. She concluded that Lenhardt finds race inseparable from American Gothic and sees few signs this will change soon.

{"id": "doc_random_212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashiach_Borochoff_House", "text": "Mashiach Borochoff House ( Hebrew : \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05d7 \u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05db\u05d5\u05e3 ) is a historical building located at 64 Jaffa Road in Jerusalem . Built in 1908 in eclectic style, its entrance is covered by an arcade with pointed arches supported by pseudo- Corinthian columns . The gate, in the style of 17th-century Georgian architecture , consists of two pillars connected by ironwork . A lion statue is placed atop each pillar. The house was built by Mashiach Borochoff, a wealthy Bukharan Jewish merchant, as a family residence. In 1947, a year after Borochoff's death, the property was sold to Barclays bank. It has functioned as a bank branch since that time. History Mashiach Borochoff was a wealthy Bukharan Jewish textile merchant who resided in Moscow . The youngest son of Baruch Borochoff, he accompanied his father to Palestine in 1882 when his father made aliyah and settled in the Nahalat Shiv'a neighborhood. Mashiach returned to Russia to run the family's business operations in Moscow and Tashkent . In 1919 he moved the family's assets to Palestine and settled in Jerusalem, where he worked as an activist on behalf of the Sephardic Jewish community. From 1925 to 1946 he served as governor of the Sephardi Orphanage. Borochoff built the mansion at 64 Jaffa Road to accommodate his large family. He acquired the land from Wilhelm Duisberg, a German Christian. The house was erected on the southern part of Duisberg's land, facing Jaffa Road, while the German Consulate was built on the northern part of the property, facing Street of the Prophets . The house faced the neighborhood of Even Yisrael across Jaffa Road. It was surrounded by other prestigious buildings, including the home of Joseph Navon to the north and the Kaminetz Hotel to the west. The house was one of several \"impressive buildings\" on Jaffa Road constructed by wealthy Bukharan Jews; others include Batei Saidoff and the Kandinoff House. Architecture Lion statues in front of the Mashiach Borochoff House, 2010 Star of David decoration on a side window. The mansion was designed in an eclectic architectural style. The entrance is covered with an arcade with three pointed arches supported by pseudo- Corinthian columns . The ceiling of the arcade is decorated with rosettes . The overall effect was meant to impress and attract the attention of passersby on Jaffa Road, the main Jerusalem thoroughfare. The ironwork front gate hangs between two pillar piers with a scrollwork overthrow bearing the date of construction, 1908. According to Kroyanker , the gate is in the style of 17th-century Georgian architecture . Atop each pillar is a lion statue. These statues were sculpted by Simcha Yanover. The lion statues are noted for their resemblance to the lion statues posted on pillars in front of the Mahane Yehuda Police Station , further to the west, although it is not known who sculpted the latter. One of the lions was rendered in micrography in The Jerusalem Haggadah (1996). In 2016 the lion statue atop the right pillar went missing; it is assumed to have been stolen. The other lion statue sustained damage to its base, but is still affixed to the pillar. Bank branch Borochoff died in 1946. In 1947 the property was sold to Barclays Bank, which turned the house into a bank branch. The branch underwent a name change in 1971 when Barclays established a subsidiary, Barclays Discount Bank. In 1993 the subsidiary was purchased by Israel Discount Bank and renamed Mercantile Discount Bank . A Mercantile Discount Bank branch operates in the house to this day.

{"id": "doc_random_214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldberry_Castle", "text": "Oldberry Castle (sometimes called Oldbury Castle) is an Iron Age hill fort north west of Dulverton , Somerset , England. It lies approximately 0.5 miles (0.80\u00a0km) north-west from Dulverton, close to the Devon border. It has been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument . The site overlooks the town and the ancient crossing point of the River Barle . It is an irregular oval shape measuring 720 feet (220\u00a0m) by 300 feet (91\u00a0m). It is defended by a bank measuring 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) wide and 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) high, and a 18 feet (5.5\u00a0m) wide ditch. Background Further information: Hill fort Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age , roughly at the start of the first millennium\u00a0BC . The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated \"[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction\".

{"id": "doc_random_216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny%27s_Children", "text": "Destiny's Children is a science-fiction series by Stephen Baxter . It takes place within his larger series, the Xeelee Sequence . Like his previous Manifold Trilogy , the books are not direct sequels to one another, but are instead thematically linked by the appearance of concepts, themes, and sometimes characters in multiple books. Examples of this include: A coalescence is visited in all three novels. The Kuiper Anomaly, a tetrahedral artifact that appears in the Kuiper belt , is discovered in Coalescent , mentioned briefly in Exultant , and finally explained in Transcendent . The characters George Poole, Michael Poole, and Rosa Poole appear in both Coalescent and Transcendent . Each book deals in some way with the future evolution of humans, both physically and sociologically. For example, Coalescent discusses the ability of humans living with limited space and resources to evolve a society that resembles insect hives. Transcendent deals with several post-human forms that are found to have evolved to adapt planets that they colonized. The theme is present in Exultant insofar as the novel deals with humanity as evolved to fight a war that has lasted tens of thousands of years. Each book further deals in some way with the existence and identity of God. For example, Exultant suggests that there was consciousness present before the universe began that selected this universe for its ability to sustain life. Transcendent discusses a group of humans that have transcended to a higher consciousness as becoming a god, and uses established theology to attempt to dissect the Transcendent's motives. Books in the series: Coalescent ( 2003 ) - Arthur C. Clarke Award nominee, 2004 Exultant ( 2004 ) Transcendent ( 2005 ) - John W.

The band consist of Barrie-James O'Neill (vocals, piano and guitar), Hamish Fingland (vocals and guitar), Lewis Andrew (vocals, guitar, accordion and keyboard) and Chris Potter (vocals and guitar). The band was formed in late 2009 in Glasgow . The quartet met through friends' bands and fortunate pub encounters. Kassidy began writing and recording their music in a shared house, which they later converted to a personal studio. They released three EP's , the second entitled The Rubbergum EP Volume 2 on 16 August 2010. To follow their EPs, Kassidy released their debut album, Hope St. , on 21 March 2011. They released their second album, One Man Army , on 30 April 2012. The band toured along with Lana Del Rey from 3 April 2013 to 31 May 2013 on her Paradise Tour in Europe. The same year, the frontman Barrie-James O'Neill collaborated with Del Rey on a cover of \" Summer Wine \" originally composed by Lee Hazlewood , and appeared in its music video with Del Rey. On 8 April 2013 the band released an EP album titled People Like Me on iTunes. On 1 February 2014, the founder and frontman of the band, Barrie-James O'Neill , left the band to move to Los Angeles to be with his then girlfriend, Lana Del Rey, and has since adopted the stage name \"Nightmare Boy\" as a solo artist. He has released two singles and an EP under that moniker. The band continued for a short while but split later that year. The remaining members have since formed a new band called White, along with Leo Condie and Kirstin Lynn. On 15 March 2021 the band announced a new single \"Don't Worry\" to be released on 22 March 2021. This was to coincide with the release of a vinyl edition of their first album and the promotion of a special event to be performed on 23 December 2021, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of their debut. However, on 17 December 2021, the concert was rescheduled to 2 June 2022.

The bridge is part of the A484 road . The road bridge is adjacent to the Loughor railway viaduct and was built by the then Dyfed and West Glamorgan county councils in 1988 with John Laing Group as the principal contractor. History Before a bridge was built here, the nearest bridge crossing was at Pontarddulais, some 5 miles upstream. However, the river could be forded at low tide, and a ferry operated when conditions allowed. There are no visible indications of a ford, but it is believed this had been used since Roman times. In 1833, a wooden swing bridge was constructed to allow wheeled vehicles to cross but still enable river traffic to gain access to wharves within the estuary. The bridge was joined by the railway viaduct, built by Brunel in 1852, which also featured a swing section, although the estuary was progressively less used by shipping. A fixed replacement road bridge was constructed in concrete in 1923. Evidence of the old bridge can still be seen from the right side of the new bridge crossing from Loughor. A parapet jutting out into the river, which is now a seating area and support, foundations can also be seen in the riverbed at low tides. However, the concrete construction was not sufficient to sustain heavy traffic, and as part of a major improvement scheme for the A484, the new bridge, with concrete piers and steel spans, was completed in 1988. The wooden trestle rail viaduct , much reworked since 1852, had also been severely hampered by structural issues and, from 1986, had been limited to a single track. It was finally replaced by a new steel bridge in 2013, along the same line as previously, allowing two-way full-speed rail travel, running parallel to the new road bridge. 170m 185yds Pre-1988 bridge line of ford L o u g h o r RIVER LOUGHOR BURRY INLET Railway Viaduct 1988 Road Bridge \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Map showing Loughor with the position of the various river crossings Topography If travelling over the bridge east, you will enter the county of Swansea and South Wales when leaving the bridge. If travelling west, you will enter the county of Carmarthenshire and the West Wales area when leaving the bridge. When leaving the bridge, heading west, the road signs change from English / Welsh to Welsh/English (Welsh written before English). This is due to the much higher use of the Welsh language in West Wales. References ^ \"River Loughor (Bridge Crossing)\" .

{"id": "doc_random_222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gravediggers", "text": "For other uses, see Gravedigger (disambiguation) . The Gravediggers (or Clowns ) are examples of Shakespearean fools (also known as clowns or jesters ), a recurring type of character in Shakespeare 's plays. Like most Shakespearean fools, the Gravediggers are peasants or commoners that use their great wit and intellect to get the better of their superiors, other people of higher social status, and each other. The Gravediggers appear briefly in Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet , making their only appearance at the beginning of Act V, scene i. They are first encountered as they are digging a grave for the newly deceased Ophelia , discussing whether she deserves a Christian burial after having apparently drowned herself. Soon, Hamlet enters and engages in a quick dialogue with the Sexton . The beat ends with Hamlet's speech regarding the circle of life prompted by his discovery of the alleged skull of his father's beloved jester, Yorick . Detailed summary The penultimate scene of the play begins with the Sexton and a fellow Gravedigger digging a grave for the late Ophelia. They debate whether she should be allowed to have a Christian burial, because she committed suicide. This quickly leads them into a discussion of the impact of politics on the decision, and the two parody lawyer speech. They present Ophelia's case from both positions: if she jumped into the water, then she killed herself, but if the water effectively jumped on her, then she did not. The Sexton laments the fact that the wealthy have more freedom to commit suicide than the poor. The pair get off the subject of suicide almost as quickly as they began it, however, as the Sexton begins to goad and test the Gravedigger, confusing him with the double meaning of the word \"arms\" (as in weapons and appendages). The dialogue between the two ends when the Sexton is unsatisfied by the answer to the riddle \"What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?\" (V.i.39\u201340) that the Gravedigger gives, and consequently sends him off to bring back alcohol. \"Hamlet, Horatio, and the Gravediggers\" by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix . The Gravedigger exits as Hamlet and Horatio enter, and the Sexton begins to sing a song on the topics of love and graves as he digs, throwing skulls up and out of the grave. Hamlet considers this behavior inappropriate and disrespectful towards what used to be someone's, and possibly an important someone's, body in such a way. He decides to ask the Sexton whose grave he is digging, but the Sexton evades the question with clever wordplay and riddles, changing the topic to that of Prince Hamlet (the Sexton fails, or pretends to fail, to recognize Hamlet) and his recent supposed bout of insanity. The Sexton then claims that one of the skulls belonged to Yorick, the king's jester and Hamlet's caretaker. Hamlet asks if this could really be so, and the Gravedigger responds with, \"E'en that,\" (V.i.159), marking his last line in the play. Jokes When together, the Gravediggers speak mainly in riddles and witty banter regarding death, with the first asking the questions and the second answering. Sexton What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter? Gravedigger The gallows-maker, for that frame outlives a thousand tenants. (V.i., 38\u201341) And later in the scene: Sexton And when you are asked this question next, say \u201cA grave-maker.\u201d The houses that he makes last till doomsday. (V.i., 53\u201355) Songs While digging Ophelia's grave, the Sexton sings to himself: Sexton In youth when I did love, did love, Methought it was very sweet To contract\u2013o\u2013the time, for\u2013a\u2013my behove, Oh, methought, there\u2013a\u2013was nothing\u2013a\u2013meet. (V.i.57\u201358) Sexton But age with his stealing steps Hath clawed me in his clutch, And hath shipped me into the land As if I had never been such. (throws up a skull) (V.i.63\u201364) Sexton A pickax and a spade, a spade, For and a shrouding sheet, Oh, a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet. (throws up another skull) (V.i.95\u201398) Note: this song is full of reworkings or misquotes from Thomas Vaux, 2nd Baron Vaux of Harrowden 's poem. \"The Aged Lover Renounceth Love\" Analysis of the scene Many important themes of the play are discussed and brought up by the Gravediggers in the short time they are on stage. The manner in which these themes are presented is notably different from the rest of the play. While the rest of the play is set solely in the fictional world of Hamlet's Denmark, this scene helps make sense of the themes by simultaneously bringing the focus to the audience's world. \"By using recognizable references from contemporary times, the clown can, through the use of the oral tradition, make the audience understand the theme being played out by the court-dominated characters in the play.\" For example, although the Sexton is definitely in the fictional world of the play (he is digging Ophelia's grave), he also asks his fellow to \"go, get thee to Yaughan, fetch me a stoup of liquor\". This does not appear in all versions and means little to us now, but it is \"generally supposed that [Yaughan] was a nearby inn-keeper [to the theatre]\". Likewise, the Sexton is in the same world as the English audience of the time when he jokes \"...[insanity] will not be seen in [Hamlet] there [in England]; there the men are as mad as he\". This gives enough of a distance from Elsinore [for the audience] to view what the clowns say as discreet parallels, not direct commentaries. The literal graveness of the situation (the funeral) subsides to the humor. This makes it possible for the characters to look at the subject of death objectively, giving rise to such speeches as Hamlet's musings over the skull of Yorick. The tone is set from the opening of the scene, during the Gravediggers' dialogue regarding Ophelia. Simply, they use her death to debate whether suicide is legitimate and forgivable according to religious law. This is not the first time that this question has been raised in the play. Hamlet has the very same discussion with himself during his \"To be, or not to be\" soliloquy in Act 3 scene 1. The characters in Act 5 scene 1 approach the topic this time with dark comedy, and in doing so bring up an entirely different theme. The parody of legal jargon used by the pair of clowns continues the theme of the corruption of politics, as seen in the usurpation of the throne by Claudius (which should have belonged to prince Hamlet) upon King Hamlet 's death. The disintegration of values, morals, and order is a theme discussed at length in \"Hamlet\". The colloquial tone of the Gravediggers brings this philosophy into the focus of the audience's world. The synthesis of all perspectives used ends in a greater comprehension of the play as a whole. Because Hamlet was written in the midst of England's Reformation, the role of religion was a contentious topic. Shakespeare was able to address religion and its relationship to suicide through Hamlet , discussing the legality of suicide through characters that have their own intention (i.e. to dig a grave) understood as separate from the author's intention. \"Hamlet's at Yorick's Grave\". ( Delacroix ) Performance During the Interregnum , all theatres were closed down by the Puritan government. Still, during this time playlets known as drolls were often performed illegally, including one based on the two clowns, called The Grave-Makers , based on Act 5, Scene 1 of Hamlet . Film In most of the movie adaptations of Hamlet , the part of the First Gravedigger (and at times the Second Gravedigger) is played by an extremely established actor or comedian. The following are the actors that portrayed the Gravedigger in the most notable cinematic productions: Stanley Holloway in Hamlet (1948), directed by Laurence Olivier Roger Livesey in Hamlet (1969), directed by Tony Richardson Trevor Peacock in Hamlet (1990), directed by Franco Zeffirelli Billy Crystal in Hamlet (1996), directed by Kenneth Branagh Jeffrey Wright in Hamlet (2000), directed by Michael Almereyda Mark Hadfield in Hamlet (2009), directed by Gregory Doran Notes ^ \"The Aged Lover Renounceth Love by Second Baron Vaux of Harrowden Thomas, Lord Vaux\" . 13 September 2021. ^ a b c Lori M Culwell (14 December 2005). \"The Role of the Clown in Shakespeare's Theatre\" .

{"id": "doc_random_223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire_hearth", "text": "Men working a Lancashire hearth in Sweden The Lancashire hearth was used to fine pig iron , removing carbon to produce wrought iron . Origins Until the early 19th century, the usual method of producing wrought iron involved a charcoal -fired finery in a finery forge . In the beginning of the 19th century this became an obsolete process and was slowly replaced by the coal-fueled puddling process . However, charcoal continued to be used in some forges after most of the iron industry had abandoned it for coke . When John Bradley & Co. (whose leading partner was James Foster ) took over forges at Eardington in Shropshire , in 1813, a potting and stamping forge, they reverted to using charcoal. In 1820, he bought Hampton Loade Forge, which then became a tinplate works and in 1826 another charcoal forge. This was followed by other charcoal forges at Horsehay in 1832 and at the Old Park ironworks of the Botfield family about 1826. Cookley Forge in the Stour valley also reverted to charcoal working in 1814, supplying wire and tinplate mills. By the 1830s, these forges were sometimes producing over 2,000 tons of iron per year, compared with a few hundred from earlier finery forges. It is likely that these forges were using a more efficient variety of hearth, which from Swedish usage has come to be known as a Lancashire hearth. Spread A Lancashire hearth in Sweden Faced with competition from cheaper British iron production, the Swedish iron industry needed to find a new cheaper method of making iron. In the 1810s, experiments were made with puddling , but this proved unsatisfactory, as it needed coal of which Sweden had none. After Gustav Ekman visited Britain, he published a report of his observations. He had seen closed finery hearths in south Wales and near Ulverston , then in Lancashire (now Cumbria ). Those in south Wales were similar to puddling furnaces, but in Lancashire, he saw closed furnaces, where the metal was in contact with the fuel. On his return to Sweden, Ekman experimented and built furnaces similar to what he had seen near Ulverston, most probably at Newland ironworks . In 1829-30, Waern installed a furnace of the south Wales type at Backefors ironworks, while independently Ekman built Lancashire hearths at Dormsj\u00f6 and S\u00f6derfors . From there the process spread to other forges. Charcoal consumption by the metallurgical industry in Sweden peaked about 1885. In 1887, 406 hearths made 210,500 tons of iron. The last Lancashire forge in Sweden was at Ramn\u00e4s , closed in 1964. In Shropshire, charcoal iron production continued on a significant scale, but declined after 1870, rods for wire-drawing being a significant product. However most charcoal forges were probably closed by 1890. A diagram of a Lancashire hearth, 1890 Process The Swedish Lancashire hearth consisted of a rectangular closed furnace with a chimney (8 metres high) at one end and a working arch in front of the hearth proper at the other. Pig iron was charged through a door at the foot of the chimney and stacked on an iron-clad bridge so that it could be heated by the waste gases from the hearth. The hearth was blown through a single water-cooled tuyere with pre-heated air . The hearth consisted of a rectangular box of iron plates, the bottom plate being water-cooled. Surplus slag was removed with a shovel between firings, but some was left to help the process. Pig stacked on the bridge at the back of the hearth was then pulled forward with a hook and charcoal added. The blast was then turned on and fining began. When the pigs began to melt, rabelling began (as in the Walloon process ) using two bars of iron one to stir the iron and the other to lift it back into the blast. Periodically the tuyere had to be cleaned of matter adhering to it with a third bar. Finally, the iron was gathered into a 'loop' which was lifted out of the hearth with a heavier bar and tongs, and taken to the shingling hammer . The process was more fuel-efficient and more productive than its predecessors. References ^ a b c d R.

Ten Thousand Buddha Pagoda. Shishuang Temple ( Chinese : \u77f3\u971c\u5bfa ; pinyin : Sh\u00edshu\u0101ng S\u00ec ) is a Buddhist temple located in the town of Jingang, Liuyang , Hunan , China. In ancient times, Shishuang Temple, Daowu Temple ( \u9053\u543e\u5bfa ), Baogai Temple ( \u5b9d\u76d6\u5bfa ) and Daguang Temple ( \u5927\u5149\u5bfa ) were called \"Four Buddhist Temples in Liuyang\". History Shishuang Temple was first built in the Qianfu period (874\u2013888) of the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907). Emperor Xizong granted the land and the then Prime Minister Pei Xiu supervised the construction of the temple. Li Zhen ( \u674e\u9707 ), the third son of Emperor Xizong, received ordination as a monk at the temple. During the Song dynasty (960\u20131279), Shishuang Chuyuan served as abbot. His disciples Yangqi Fanghui and Huanglong Huinan founded the Yangqi sect and Huanglong sect, respectively. Japanese monks Eisai and Garin (monk) came to the temple to study Linji school . Shishuang Temple went into decline in the Yuan and Ming dynasties (1271\u20131644). In 1735, in the 13th year of Yongzheng Emperor 's reign during the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), monks rebuilt the Grand Buddha Hall. The Shanmen and corridor were restored in 1794, in the ruling of Qianlong Emperor . And the Great Mercy Pavilion was renovated in 1879. In 1923, monks refurbished the Mahavira Hall . After the Cultural Revolution , in 1978, the local government repaired the Shanmen, Four Heavenly Kings Hall , Mahavira Hall, Guanyin Hall , Jade Buddha Hall, Buddhist Texts Library , Guru Hall , etc. In 1991, Shi Weiyi ( \u91ca\u552f\u4e00 ), a Taiwanese monk, raised funds to build the Shanmen Hall . The Dining Hall and Meditation Hall were added to the temple in 1993. In 2014, Shishuang Temple has been categorized as an AAA level tourist site by the China National Tourism Administration . Architecture The entire temple faces south with the Shanmen , Four Heavenly Kings Hall , Mahavira Hall , and the Guanyin Hall along the central axis of the complex. There are over 10 halls and rooms on both sides, including Guru Hall , Jade Buddha Hall, Abbot Hall, Monastic Dining Hall, Monastic Reception Hall and Meditation Hall.

{"id": "doc_random_226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harkers_Island,_North_Carolina", "text": "Harkers Island is a census-designated place (CDP) in Carteret County , North Carolina , United States. The population of Harkers Island was 1,207 at the 2010 census . Harkers Island is unincorporated and receives most public services, including law enforcement and public education, from Carteret County. A membership cooperative provides the island with electric and water services. Major industries on the island include fishing, boat building, tourism, and waterfowl decoy carving. Formerly named Davers Ile and Craney Island , Harkers Island was occupied by Native Americans of the Coree tribe when the first European explorers arrived in the 16th century. Ownership of Harkers Island was first titled to Farnifold Green, a native of the Carolina colony , by the lord proprietor in 1707. Ebenezer Harker purchased the island in 1730, settled there with his family, and built a plantation and boat yard. The island became known as Harkers Island soon after his death. A large immigration of islanders fleeing the hurricane-ravaged Outer Banks in 1899 dramatically increased the island population, which largely depended on fishing and boat building. Separated from the mainland for centuries, many Harkers Island residents speak a distinct dialect of English, earning them the nickname \" Hoi toiders .\" History Before the arrival of European explorers and settlers, Harkers Island was inhabited by Native Americans of the Coree tribe, who likely spoke a language of the Algonquian family, like most coastal tribes. The nearby Core Sound and Core Banks are named after the Coree. The Coree left little in the way of evidence of permanent habitation on Harkers Island, except for a large mound of oyster shells at Shell Point on the eastern end of the island. Similar shell mounds were found by Europeans on the Shackleford Banks and other islands of the Outer Banks. The exact purpose of the mounds for the Coree remains unknown, but varying cultures of indigenous peoples in the Southeast had been building major earthwork mounds since 3500 BCE, the Middle Archaic period , usually related to religious and ceremonial uses. In 1584, an English expedition financed by Sir Walter Raleigh and led by Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe explored the North Carolina coast for a suitable site for the first English colony in North America. Two Native Americans, Wanchese and Manteo , accompanied the expedition back to England in the fall of 1584. According to local island legend, Wanchese was a Coree from Harkers Island. The island was first charted on the maps drawn by John White during the 1584 expedition, but it was unnamed at the time. The island appears on a 1624 map of the greater Virginia coastline created by Captain John Smith . On that map, the island is labeled \"Davers Ile\", probably for Sir John Davers, one of the founders of Jamestown in 1607. On December 20, 1707, Farnifold Green obtained the first patent for land in the Core Sound area from the lord proprietor of the Carolina colony, which had been established by the English monarch Charles I in 1633. This patent included Harkers Island, which was then known as Craney Island. On June 25, 1709, Green sold the island to William Brice for \u00a35, who on the very same day sold it to Thomas Sparrow III (1674\u20131717) for \u00a310. Sparrow soon sold the island to Thomas Pollock, who would twice be governor of North Carolina (from 1712 to 1714 and again in 1722). Pollock did not take up residence on the island, but had several farm buildings erected and then leased to settlers. The 1720 lease to a Captain Stone was \u00a33 a year. Thomas Pollock's son George inherited the island upon his father's death on August 30, 1722. Settlement of Ebenezer Harker George Pollock sold Craney Island to Ebenezer Harker on September 15, 1730, for \u00a3400 and \"one boate twentey foot long with oars & mast\". Harker had immigrated to Massachusetts from England on a ship that set sail from Wales . Living in Boston , Harker had been involved in the whaling trade, and became familiar with the North Carolina coast during this time. Harker had moved to Beaufort, North Carolina , by 1728, where he was appointed a tax collector for the whale oil revenue generated in the area. After purchasing the island, Harker took up residence there with his family and began building a small plantation and boat yard. Harker sold half of the island to his nephew John Stevens of Onslow County on March 8, 1733, for \u00a3300, with many restrictions on its agricultural use. Prohibited from farming or ranching the land for profit, Stevens eventually sold his half of the island back to his uncle on June 9, 1737, for just \u00a3180. The Harker plantation and boat building facility were located at the western end of the island, near Harker Point, and grew to support an extended family with three sons, two daughters, and at least nine African slaves. Ebenezer would be the last sole landowner of the island. In 1752, he deeded approximately 10 acres (4.0\u00a0ha) of the island to his daughter Hepsobeth and her husband Nathan Yeomans as a wedding gift. On his death in 1762, his son Zachariah inherited the western third of the island, an adult slave woman named Vilet, and a young female slave named Daisie. Another son, James, inherited the eastern third of the island, an adult slave woman named Hague and a young male slave named Peter. Ebenezer Jr. inherited the central third of the island, an adult male slave named Jeffrey, and a young male slave named Sutton. Hepsobeth inherited \"one barrel of corn \", and Ebenezer's other married daughter, Sarah Freshwater, was given a female slave named Hope. The fate of an elderly female slave named Badge and a young male slave named Ben was left to the heirs to decide. The will referred to \"Craney Island\"; the name \"Harkers Island\" was only adopted after Ebenezer's death. The sons of Ebenezer prospered on Harkers Island. Ebenezer Jr. was elected Sheriff of Carteret County in 1758. Zachariah Harker developed a salt works on the western third of Harkers Island in 1776. In the following years, Zachariah and his brothers became supporters of the American Revolution , and Zachariah was appointed one of five captains in the Carteret Regiment fighting against the British. Harkers Island was involved in the Battle of Beaufort, North Carolina. Revolutionaries used warehouse facilities on Harkers Island to store provisions sought by British troops who had seized the nearby county seat of Beaufort. Thirteen men guarding the stores on Harkers Island, probably led by Zachariah Harker, repulsed British troops in a brief battle on April 6, 1782. The first national census of 1790 recorded 16 white residents and 13 slaves on Harkers Island. By 1800, the population had expanded to 26 white residents, 16 slaves, and 7 \"others\", probably those of mixed race or freed slaves . Ebenezer Jr., James, and Zachariah Harker died in 1803, 1814, and 1824, respectively. Nineteenth century Harkers Island remained sparsely populated until the latter part of the 19th century. The island saw no direct military conflict in the American Civil War ; however, Union warships anchored near the island to control access to Bogue Sound and Core Sound during the Battle of Fort Macon . The besieged Confederate garrison at Fort Macon surrendered on April 26, 1862. Harkers Island and the surrounding area remained under Union control for the duration of the war. The few, if any, descendants of the Harker slaves still living on the island likely left soon after emancipation . The vast majority of the freed slaves in the coastal societies of Carteret and Craven counties either emigrated to other parts of the state, or moved into their own, separate communities, such as Davis Ridge, the North River Community, and Craven Corner. In 1864, the first school on the island was established when Miss Jenny Bell came to Harkers Island from Boston, sponsored by the Northern Methodist Episcopal Church . A fish oil factory was built on the island in 1865 and remained operational until 1873. A small milling facility was built on the west end of the island in 1870 by Louie Larson, an immigrant from Norway , but it closed before the turn of the 20th century. Most island residents continued to earn a subsistence living from boat building or fishing. The Hurricane of 1899 Harkers Island saw an influx of new residents after hurricanes in 1896 and 1899 devastated the communities established on the nearby Core Banks and Shackleford Banks. Mostly fishermen and whalers, the people of the Outer Banks began openly debating the merits of moving after the Hurricane of 1896. William Henry Guthrie of Diamond City was one of the first to relocate, buying 64.5 acres (26.1\u00a0ha) of land on Harkers Island in 1897. Some others moved to more sheltered locations on the coast, but most Shackleford residents remained on the Banks. Diamond City was by far the largest town in that area of the coast, with over 700 inhabitants. Three years later, another hurricane hit the Carolina coast, and this time the disaster for the residents of the Shackleford Banks was total. Diamond City was completely destroyed by the August 17 Hurricane of 1899 . The storm ravaged the Banks' protective sand dunes , and washed away nearly all of the top soil. Orchards and maritime forest on the Banks soon began dying from the salt left behind by the storm surge . Homes were ripped from their foundations, shattered, or submerged. Even graves in the local cemeteries were uprooted and disturbed. A botanist who visited the Banks after the storm described the landscape as completely devastated. Many families used boats to move what was left of their houses, plank by plank, from the Outer Banks to Harkers Island where they could rebuild. Some settled on the Guthrie property, which he began to subdivide. Others purchased or leased land on the island anywhere they could. Some emigrated to Morehead City , on the mainland, where they built a new neighborhood soon nicknamed \"The Promised Land\". The last resident had left Diamond City by 1902. In the five years between 1895 and 1900, the population of Harkers Island expanded fourfold from just 13 extended families to over 1,000 residents. The island had gone from being one of the smallest communities in Carteret County to one of the largest. Elders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) proselytized extensively on Harkers Island after the hurricanes. Many of the refugees from Diamond City, uprooted physically and emotionally by the devastating hurricanes, converted to the Latter Day Saints, and soon outnumbered the members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, which had been founded on the island in 1875. A national wave of anti-Mormon sentiment was sparked by the Smoot Hearings in 1904, fueling fears that Mormons secretly continued to practice polygamy . The relationship between the Mormons on Harkers Island and their neighbors deteriorated. Residents threw rocks and oyster shells through the windows of the LDS meetinghouse and fired at least one gunshot into the building. In 1906, arsonists burned the meetinghouse to the ground. Organized Mormon religious services did not resume on Harkers Island until 1909. A new LDS meetinghouse was constructed on the island in the 1930s. Despite these difficult beginnings, Harker's Island has one of the highest percentages of residents as members of the Latter-day Saints of any locality in North Carolina. Twentieth century Harkers Island gradually became more connected to North Carolina and the world at large early in the 20th century. With the influx of new residents from the Outer Banks, a post office was opened in 1904. The first public road to extend the length of the island, Harkers Island Drive, was built in 1926 when a footpath was widened and paved with the oyster shells from the Coree mound at Shell Point. The road was hard paved by the county in 1936. The road and the post office were connected to the mainland by a ferry service until the Earl C. Davis Memorial Bridge was built in 1941. A wooden structure, the bridge connected the northwestern end of Harkers Island to the small town of Straits directly to the north. The location of the bridge was a matter of some local controversy at the time. Most islanders would have preferred a bridge to the west, connecting the island directly to the city of Beaufort with its commercial infrastructure and the county hospital. Local politics and the shorter distance to Straits likely dictated the final location of the bridge. A local political effort to relocate the bridge during its renovation to a steel structure in 1966 also failed. The 1933 Outer Banks Hurricane which made landfall on September 15 would forever change the economy of Harkers Island. The storm was blamed for at least 21 fatalities in North Carolina (although none on Harkers Island) and an estimated US$1\u00a0million of damage. The storm surge damaged fisheries and inland waterways, but there was one unexpected beneficial result. Retreating storm surge and heavy rainfall combined to carve out a new channel in the Banks, separating the Core Banks from the Shackleford Banks near the Cape Lookout Lighthouse . This new channel gave Harkers Island fishermen a new, direct access route to offshore fishing grounds. The new channel was named Barden Inlet after US Senator Graham Barden , who sponsored legislation to require that the United States Army Corps of Engineers use dredging equipment to maintain the new channel. More economic opportunity for Harkers Island came as the country began pulling itself out of the Great Depression . Electrification came to the island in 1939. The Harkers Island Rural Electric Authority was the first electrical cooperative in the United States to supply power to members through a submarine cable system. In November 1941, the construction of a new United States Marine Corps Air Station at Cherry Point , 30 miles (48\u00a0km) to the northwest of Harkers Island, brought more wage-earning jobs to the local economy. When the United States entered World War II , Harkers Island was on the front lines. German submarines patrolled the North Carolina coast and sank merchant shipping traffic, especially oil tankers. Island residents could watch the tankers burning offshore at night. Further improvements in the island's utility services would have to wait until after the war. Telephone service finally arrived in 1948. The National Seashore The Shackleford Banks played an important economic role for the people of Harkers Island throughout much of the 20th century. Islanders continued to use the Banks for livestock grazing, including sheep, goats, cattle, and horses. Harkers Island fishermen first built seasonal camps and later cottages on the Banks. A herd of wild horses on the Shackleford Banks provided new colts every spring to those from Harkers Island who rounded them up. The islanders viewed the improvements of cottages, horse corrals , and campsites as an extension of their economic livelihood on Harkers Island. All of that would change with the government determination to acquire the barrier islands for public park land. The state of North Carolina began purchasing land on the Core Banks and Shackleford Banks in 1959 with the intention of creating a state park. The federal government became interested a few years later, and envisioned the Outer Banks of North Carolina being included in a string of national seashores stretching the length of the United States Atlantic coast. After negotiations between the state of North Carolina and the United States Department of the Interior , the United States Congress passed a law authorizing the creation of a Cape Lookout National Seashore , which was signed into law by President Lyndon Baines Johnson on March 10, 1966. Conversion of the Banks to a national park brought much turmoil to Harkers Island. Many Harkers Island fishermen discovered that cottages and other improvements they had made on the Banks were on land that would be condemned . Many land deeds had recording errors, some had been poorly surveyed, and natural changes to the shorelines affected many claims. Few of the cottages that had been built were on land that the builders owned. Legal eviction and condemnation proceedings lasted into the 1980s. The creation of the park also ended the open grazing of livestock on the Banks by December 31, 1985. A herd of wild horses, allegedly descended from Spanish horses that swam to shore from shipwrecks in the 16th century, was allowed to remain on the Banks. In late December of that year, a series of arson fires destroyed most of the major structures on the Shackleford Banks, including a recently constructed park visitor center. An inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation failed to discover the arsonists. The creation of the National Seashore marked the end of a lifestyle practiced by many Harkers Island residents. Fishing and boat building remain important components of the community's economy, but are increasingly augmented with tourism . Visitors arrive at Harkers Island seeking access to the National Seashore, for sport fishing opportunities, and to experience the local cultural heritage of the islands. Geography Harkers Island is located south of the center of Carteret County. The Harkers Island census-designated place covers the entire island and extends slightly out into the surrounding water. According to the United States Census Bureau , the CDP has a total area of 3.9 square miles (10.0\u00a0km 2 ), of which 2.2 square miles (5.8\u00a0km 2 ) is land and 1.6 square miles (4.2\u00a0km 2 ), or 41.76%, is water. At its highest point, the island is 19 feet (5.8\u00a0m) above mean sea level , in an area known as the \"sand hole\", on the western end of the island, made up of mostly white sand on rolling dunes. Harkers Island is protected from the Atlantic Ocean by the barrier islands of the Shackleford Banks to the south and the Core Banks to the east. The body of water directly south of the island is Back Sound . To the east is Core Sound , to the north is The Straits, and to the northwest is the mouth of the North River. The Straits are shallow but navigable by those with local experience. There are two small bays on the north side of the island, Westmouth Bay and Eastmouth Bay. North of Eastmouth Bay is Browns Island, which is accessible only by boat. Harkers Island Road, designated as State Road 1335, connects the island to the mainland by the Earl C. Davis Memorial Bridge, a steel swing bridge built in 1968 to replace a wooden bridge built in 1941. Government and services Harkers Island is unincorporated and receives most public services, including law enforcement and public education, from Carteret County. Law enforcement on the island is provided by the Carteret County Sheriff Department. The only public school on the island, Harkers Island Elementary, educates students from kindergarten through fifth grade, and is operated by Carteret County Public Schools . The school has won the state Battle of the Books competition twice and has been to the competition for four years in a row; both are state records. There are no hospitals on Harkers Island. The local newspaper is the Carteret County News-Times , published in Morehead City . Electricity service and drinking water are both provided by the Harkers Island Electric Membership Corporation, a cooperative operating as both a Rural Electrical Authority and the manager of the water system for the Harkers Island Sanitary District since 1969. Economy Major industries on the island include fishing, boat building, tourism, and waterfowl decoy carving. In 2013, the United States Census Bureau reported 22 business establishments on Harkers Island employing 107 people. A majority of the business fall into Retail and Food Services (9) or Construction, Manufacturing, and Warehousing (9). The businesses in the latter category are almost entirely associated with boat building, boat repair, and boat storage. Many island residents are self-employed in the fishing trade. A relatively large percentage of island residents are over the age of 65 and/or retired . Commercial fishing has always been an important component of the island economy. Historically, this trade included whaling and the hunting of dolphins . Until ice became available in the 1920s, the primary commercial catch was mullet, which was caught near the beaches of Shackleford Bank and Core Bank and salted on shore. In the late 19th century, the Core Sound area produced 80% of the salted mullet sold on the United States east coast. An ice plant was built in nearby Beaufort in 1920, and fish houses were established on the island to process fish and shellfish. Some bay areas on the north side of the island have been developed for harvesting cultured shellfish. In addition to mullet, the commercial fishing industry of Harkers Island brings in oysters, clams, shrimp, scallops , crabs, spot , croaker , trout, flounder , bluefish , and mackerel . Tourism on Harkers Island is becoming a more important part of the local economy. The National Park Service operates the Cape Lookout National Seashore Visitors Center on Harkers Island. Ferry service from Harkers Island is one of the principal means of tourist access to Cape Lookout and the Shackleford Banks. Big-game fishing operations cater to growing demand for sport fishing in the area. Other tourism related industries include gift shops, local artists, hotels, and restaurants. Despite growth in the tourist trades and the local effort to make the island a top destination for waterfowl enthusiasts, Harkers Island continues to have some of the least developed tourist facilities on the Crystal Coast . One of the fastest growing industries on the island is waterfowl enthusiast tourism. Founded in 1987 at the Harkers Island home of Wayne Davis, the Core Sound Decoy Carvers Guild organized the first of what would become an annual festival in December 1998. The first Core Sound Waterfowl Festival attracted 1,800 attendees. Later renamed the Core Sound Decoy Festival, the event has attracted over 10,000 tourists to Harkers Island. The Core Sound Waterfowl Museum, operated by a separate board of directors from the Carvers Guild, is a major year-round tourist attraction for the island. The museum building is a 20,000 square feet (1,900\u00a0m 2 ) structure located on property leased from the National Park Service. In addition to telling the history of local waterfowl and the traditions of decoy carving, the museum operates exhibits of local historical interest. The museum also hosts events during Waterfowl Weekend, held on the same weekend as the Decoy Festival. The festival weekend is the most important annual event for the Harkers Island tourism economy. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 1,525 people, 661 households, and 497 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 598.4 inhabitants per square mile (231.0/km 2 ). There were 1,109 housing units at an average density of 435.2 per square mile (168.0/km 2 ).

About 13.6% of families and 15.5% of the population were below the poverty line , including 18.8% of those under age 18 and 19.1% of those age 65 or over. Local dialect With a long history of physical and economic isolation from mainland North Carolina, residents of Harkers Island and other Outer Banks islands, such as Ocracoke , have developed a distinct dialect of English , commonly referred to as High tider , that can be traced back to that of the Elizabethan period . The dialect of Harkers Island developed in almost complete isolation for over 250 years. Harkers Island English shares features with other regional dialects of the US Atlantic coast. Pronunciation , vocabulary , and grammatical constructions can be traced to eastern and southwestern England. The dialect has survived because the community continues to depend on traditional trades, like fishing, boat building, and decoy carving, and the coastal tourism trade developed on Harkers Island much later than islands like Ocracoke. Pronunciation in Harkers Island English can be different from the English spoken in the rest of the United States. \"High tide\" spoken in Harkers Island English might sound like \"hoi toide\", \"time\" sounds like \"toime\", \"fish\" is pronounced close to \"feesh\", \"fire\" sounds like \"far\", and \"cape\" is pronounced \"ca'e\". Words with \"oi\" substitute the pronunciation \"er\": \"Toilet\" sounds like \"terlet\". Words with a short \"a\" substitute schwa : \"crabs\" become \"crebs\". Words beginning with \"i\" frequently receive a prefix aspirated \"h\": \"it\" becomes \"hit\". Words ending in a vowel are frequently suffixed with an \"r\". The traditional word for a porch across the width of a building, \"piazza\", loses the \"t\" of the Italian pronunciation and becomes \"poyzer\". Thus, \"Hit's so hot the blue crebs hev come up on the poyzer to git in the shade,\" and \"hit was so rough there were whiteceps in the terlet.\" Another phrase is \"The ersters hev arroived;\" the large fish with a prominent dorsal fin is a \"sherk\". The island dialect has also retained anachronistic vocabulary in regular usage. Some examples include \"mommick\", meaning to frustrate or bother, \"yethy\", describing stale or unpleasant odor, and \"nicket\", meaning a pinch of something used as in cooking. The islanders have also developed unique local words used in regular conversation, including \"dingbatter\" to refer to a visitor or recent arrival to the island, and \"dit-dot,\" a term developed from a joke about Morse code , and used to describe any visitor to the island who has difficulty understanding the local dialect. As many as 500 islanders on Harkers Island are directly descended from the Harkers Island and Outer Banks settlers that developed this distinct dialect. Linguists from North Carolina State University , East Carolina University , and other academic institutions continue to conduct research on the island dialect. Education It is within the Carteret County Schools district. Residents are zoned to Harkers Island Elementary School, Down East Middle School @ Smyrna, and East Carteret High School . Religion In 2006, Harkers Island had eight Christian churches. Established churches and religious organizations on Harkers Island include the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , Free Grace Wesleyan Church , Grace Holiness Church , Harkers Island Pentecostal Holiness Church , Harkers Island United Methodist Church , Huggins Memorial Baptist Church Parsonage, the Lighthouse Chapel (non-denominational), and the Refuge Fellowship Church (non-denominational).

{"id": "doc_random_229", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Stockton", "text": "Robert Field Stockton (August 20, 1795 \u2013 October 7, 1866) was a United States Navy commodore , notable in the capture of California during the Mexican\u2013American War . He was a naval innovator and an early advocate for a propeller-driven, steam-powered navy. Stockton was from a notable political family and also served as a U.S. senator from New Jersey . Biography Coat of Arms of Robert F. Stockton Robert F. Stockton was born at Morven , Stockton Street, Princeton, New Jersey , into a political family; his father Richard Stockton was a U.S. senator and representative, and his grandfather, Judge Richard Stockton , was attorney general for New Jersey and a signer of the Declaration of Independence . Robert F. Stockton was of English descent , and his family had been in what is now the United States since the early colonial period. On March 4, 1823, he married Harriet Maria Potter in Charleston, South Carolina. Ten children were born to this marriage. Early naval service Stockton was appointed a midshipman in the U.S. Navy in September 1811, shortly after his 16th birthday, and served at sea and ashore during the War of 1812 . After that conflict, Lieutenant Stockton was assigned to ships operating in the Mediterranean, in the Caribbean and off the coast of West Africa. He was the first naval officer to act against the slave trade and captured several slave ships. In December 1821, while commanding USS\u00a0 Alligator along the African Windward Coast, Lt. Stockton, along with Dr. Eli Ayers of the American Colonization Society , negotiated a treaty that led to the founding of the state of Liberia . One source said that Stockton \"leveled a pistol at King Peter 's head and thereby convinced the latter to sell some of his territory\". Another source states that, before Stockton leveled his pistol at King Peter, he handed another pistol to Ayers, directing him to shoot a mixed race slave trader who was warning King Peter that the Americans sought to end the slave trade from which King Peter's tribe profited. Business affairs During the later 1820s and into the 1830s, Stockton primarily devoted his attention to business affairs in New Jersey . In addition, Stockton owned and operated the Tellurium gold mine in Goochland and Fluvanna counties in Virginia. He had purchased it in 1848, after its discovery in 1832. His son John P. Stockton was born during this period. He later followed his father into politics and was elected as a U.S. senator representing New Jersey. In 1835, Stockton purchased a property in Monmouth County, New Jersey , called \"Sea Girt\". The property was purchased in 1875 by a group of land developers, with the name of Stockton's estate ultimately leading to the choice of the name Sea Girt, New Jersey , when the borough was established in 1918. Commodore Robert F. Stockton Resumes active naval service In 1838, Stockton resumed active naval service as a captain . He served in the European area but took leave in 1840 to undertake political work. Offered the post of U.S. Secretary of the Navy by President John Tyler in 1841, he declined the offer but worked successfully to gain support for the construction of an advanced steam warship with a battery of very heavy guns. This ship became USS\u00a0 Princeton , the Navy's first screw-propelled steamer . The ship was designed by John Ericsson . Stockton commanded her when she was completed in 1843. The ship was armed with two long 225-pounder wrought iron guns, called the \" Peacemaker \" and the \" Oregon \". Although he was the deviser of the defective gun, Captain Stockton's political influence allowed him to be absolved of all responsibility for the February 1844 explosion of the gun, the Peacemaker , on board the ship. The explosion killed two cabinet secretaries and several others. Cleared by the court of any wrongdoing in the explosion incident, Stockton was sent by President James K. Polk to Texas . Stockton carried with him Polk's offer to annex Texas, sailing on the Princeton and arriving in Galveston . Stockton's observations while in Texas made him aware of the looming war with Mexico , a fact he communicated directly to Polk once he arrived back in Washington . No vessel during the Mexican war was more useful than the Princeton in the Gulf of Mexico. The records of the Navy Department showed she performed more service than all the rest of the Gulf squadron put together. Mexican\u2013American War Conquest of California On July 23, 1846, Commodore Stockton arrived in Monterey, California , and took over command from the ailing Commodore John D. Sloat of the Pacific Squadron of U.S. naval forces in the Pacific Ocean. Commodore Sloat had previously raised the US flag, without resistance, at Monterey, but had no plan to conduct any further military operations on shore and once relieved, sailed home to the United States, leaving Commodore Stockton in command of all US forces. Stockton's command ship was USS\u00a0 Congress and his combined fleet of three frigates with about 480 men each, one ship of the line with about 780 men and up to four sloops with about 200 men each as well as three storeships made him the strongest force in California as well as the senior military commander and military governor . He was the main driving force in continuing to take possession of Alta California . On August 11, 1846, Commodore Stockton marched on Pueblo de Los Angeles to meet in battle with General Castro 's army. Upon learning of the imminent arrival of Commodore Stockton, Castro retired, leaving behind all his artillery and made off in the direction of Sonora. Immediately after these events Stockton dispatched a courier, Kit Carson , to inform Washington of the proceedings and details of his conquest of California. On December 6, 1846, Stockton learned that General Stephen Kearny had arrived in California with a small force and that he was besieged by vastly superior enemy forces at the Battle of San Pasqual . Kearny was among the wounded and in command of only 60 weary dragoons mounted on tired mules who were in a perilous position and under attack from a Californio -Mexican cavalry force under Andr\u00e9s Pico . However, for Commodore Stockton's immediate decision to take personal command of a relief column, the outcome could have been disastrous for Kearny. Later, the combined forces consolidated control over San Diego, and in January 1847 won the minor skirmishes at the Battle of Rio San Gabriel and Battle of La Mesa taking back control of Los Angeles. Faced with the approximate 200 men under John C. Fremont 's California Battalion as well as Stockton and Kearny's troops, the Californios sued for peace and signed the Treaty of Cahuenga , which ending fighting in Alta California. Stockton, as senior military authority and military governor of the occupied territory, authorized John C. Fremont's appointment to succeed him as military governor and commander of the California Battalion militia force. When General Kearny finally arrived with orders to assume control of the temporary government Stockton turned over control to Kearny. Political pursuits Stockton resigned from the Navy in May 1850 and returned to business and political pursuits. In 1851, he was elected as a Democrat from New Jersey to the United States Senate, where he sponsored a bill to abolish flogging as a Navy punishment. He resigned on January 10, 1853, to serve as president of the Delaware and Raritan Canal Company , a position he held until 1866. He was a delegate to the unsuccessful Peace Conference of 1861 that attempted to settle the secession crisis; instead the American Civil War began later that year. In 1863, he was appointed to command the New Jersey militia when the Confederate Army invaded Pennsylvania . Stockton died at Princeton, New Jersey , in October 1866, and is buried in the Princeton Cemetery . Legacy Four U.S. Navy ships have been named USS\u00a0 Stockton in his honor. The cities of Stockton, California and Stockton, Missouri are named in his honor, as is the borough of Stockton, New Jersey , Stockton Street in San Francisco , and Fort Stockton , San Diego, California , which is now a ruin, but was occupied during the Mexican\u2013American War . In Mariposa County, California Stockton Creek is named after him due to a mine he owned in the California Gold Rush . In Liberia, Stockton Creek, a tidal channel that connects the Mesurado River and the Saint Paul River , and that separates Bushrod Island from the mainland in Monrovia , is also named for him. Formerly Commodore Stockton Elementary School in San Francisco between Clay and Pacific Streets was named after him. Stockton Street in San Jose was named after him and his Garden Alameda San Jose neighborhood. In Sacramento, Stockton Boulevard is the historic thoroughfare linking Sacramento and Stockton, now superseded by Highway 99 and Interstate\u00a05 .

{"id": "doc_random_233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airfare", "text": "An airfare (otherwise known as a fare) is the fee paid by a passenger for air transport. It consists of the charge for a passenger to fly from an origin to a destination and includes the conditions, rules, and restrictions for travelling on the airfare. Airfares are typically made up of fare and rule components that define the airfare product, services, and price and include origin/destination pair, fare class, one-way/round-trip indicator, fare amount, validity dates, mileage, and other rules. To sell the airfares many airlines rely on inventory allocations within finite, alphabetically defined sub-groups \u2013 \"inventory buckets\" \u2013 and fare codes for each fare sold. Airlines have sold airfares in this way since the beginning of commercial air travel and before computer reservations systems existed. As new computerized systems were gradually introduced to the air transport industry in the 1960s, this method of defining airfares and managing them within fare codes was further developed, and usage became widespread. Evolving business models (such as low-cost carriers ]), changing consumer needs, and internet-age technologies such as more flexible shopping and booking technology are allowing airlines to price and distribute their products in new ways. Fare class A fare class (otherwise known as booking class ) is an airline industry term that indicates travel class and refers to the quality of seat, cabin, or other characteristics of the class of travel. Fare classes are used by most airline reservations systems and revenue management departments to divide every seat on a plane into different categories, each with its own price and set of rules. Fare filing More than 450 airlines publish in excess of more than 100 million airfares through the airline-owned airfare database Airline Tariff Publishing Company (ATPCO) for onward distribution to Global Distribution Systems (GDSs) and third-party retailers. ATPCO has been a critical component in airline distribution for more than 50 years. The process of filing fares is manual and requires data entry of fares, fare rules, prices, and taxes into the ATPCO database. Fare code Fare codes (otherwise known as booking codes or reservation booking designators ( RBD )) are used in reservation transactions to specify the class of service a passenger should be booked to receive the fare, and functions also as an inventory control code. Some fare codes are standard across all airlines, while some are very different depending on the airline. For example, a plane may have 25 economy seats still available, and the airline may show them in a reservation system as Y7 K5 M4 T6 E3, which indicates how many of each booking class can be reserved. Agents cannot sell some codes, and those seats may be reserved for international connections, loyalty programs, or airline staff relocation. Fare codes were defined by IATA , but airlines have deviated from the IATA standard and current booking codes are airline-specific. The same code may have different meanings for tickets issued by different airlines. Many airlines use nearly all letters of the alphabet to support yield management . Certain booking codes have retained the same meaning across most airlines: Fare rule Fare rules provide the detailed terms, conditions, and services for which fare classes are offered. In the case of pre-filed fares in ATPCO, the fare rule can refer to regulations governing published fares (grouped by categories) or to fares that are contained in the text of a rule (Fare By Rule). Difference between fare code and fare basis code A fare code (or booking code, or reservation booking designator) is identified by one or two letters. A fare basis code (often just referred to as a fare basis ) can be 1-8 alphanumeric characters and is used to determine the price and restrictions on a ticket. Fare basis codes start with a letter called a fare code which almost always matches the booking class in which the reservation is booked. Example: Fare basis code WH7LNR tells us the following: W: I have a W booking class ticket (= Fare Code) H: It's a high-season ticket. 7: I have to book 7 days in advance. L: It's a long-haul flight. NR: The ticket is non-refundable. Dynamic (Airfare) Pricing Current airline pricing is based on standards based on technology that is more than 50 years old. This technology statically defines products and restricts airlines to 26 price points. The limited number of price points leads to unnecessary price jumps that are not beneficial for either customers or airlines. Many airlines are looking to overcome the disadvantages of current airline pricing and allow more prices to better serve customer demands. Many airlines are implementing Dynamic Pricing (sometimes referred to as Dynamic Offers). Dynamic pricing is the automatic adjustment of a starting price based on data insights to optimize revenue and customer uptake. Starting price data can come from any number of sources \u2013 ranging from Revenue Management (RM) systems to ATPCO filed fares An example of Dynamic Pricing is \"continuous pricing\" implemented by Lufthansa Group .

For the former Shan princely state, see M\u00f6ng Mit . Momeik ( Burmese : \u1019\u102d\u102f\u1038\u1019\u102d\u1010\u103a ; Shan : \u1019\u102d\u1030\u1004\u103a\u1038\u1019\u102d\u1010\u103a\u1088 ), also known as M\u00f6ng Mit or Mongmit , is a town on the Shweli River in northern Shan State , Myanmar . It is the capital of Mongmit District and the principal town of Mongmit Township . Transport Momeik is connected by road to Mogok and its ruby mines, and via Mogok to Mandalay and Kyaukme , which is on the Mandalay - Lashio railway line. Momeik is also linked to Myitkyina , capital of Kachin State via Mabein and Bhamo . There is an airport for domestic flights to Momeik. Mogok has an elevation of 4,000 feet (1,200\u00a0m), but Momeik is just 800 feet (240\u00a0m) above sea level and 28 miles (45\u00a0km) north of Mogok. 60 miles (97\u00a0km) by road to the west of Mogok lies Twinnge Village and the town of Thabeikkyin on the Ayeyarwady River (Irrawaddy). A direct road links Twinnge with Momeik. History Main article: M\u00f6ng Mit M\u00f6ng Mit was founded in 1238. Thirteen villages of the Mogok Stone Tract were given to M\u00f6ng Mit in 1420 as a reward for helping Yunnan raid Chiang Mai . In 1465, Nang Han Lung, the daughter-in-law of the Saopha ( Sawbwa in Burmese ) of M\u00f6ng Mit, sent ruby as separate tribute from Hsenwi and succeeded in keeping Hsenwi's former possessions until 1484, when Mogok was ceded to the Burmese kings . Not until 1597 was the Saopha of M\u00f6ng Mit forced to exchange Mogok and Kyatpyin with Tagaung . They were formally annexed by royal edict . In 1542, the Shan ruler of Ava , Thohanbwa , marched with the Saophas of M\u00f6ng Mit, M\u00f6ng Yang , Hsipaw , M\u00f6ng Kawng , Man Maw , and Yawnghwe to come to the aid of Prome against the Burmese, but they were defeated by Bayinnaung . In 1544, Hkonmaing , the Saopha of Onbaung-Hsipaw and Thohanbwa's successor on the throne of Ava, attempted to regain Prome with the help of M\u00f6ng Mit, M\u00f6ng Yang, M\u00f6ng Nai , Hsenwi, Man Maw and Yawnghwe, but was defeated by King Tabinshwehti . Bayinnaung succeeded in three campaigns in 1556\u20131559 to reduce the Shan states of M\u00f6ng Mit (Momeik), M\u00f6ng Yang (Mohnyin), M\u00f6ng Kawng (Mogaung), M\u00f6ng Pai (Moby\u00e8), Samka (Saga), Lawksawk (Yatsauk), Yawnghwe, Hsipaw, Man Maw, Kalay , Chiang Mai , and Linzin ( Vientiane ) before he raided up the Taping and Shweli Rivers in 1562. A bell donated by King Bayinnaung at Shwezigon Pagoda in Bagan has inscriptions in Burmese , Pali and Mon recording the conquest of Momeik and Hsipaw on 25 January 1557 and the building of a pagoda at Momeik on 8 February 1557. British rule The Saopha of M\u00f6ng Mit had just died at the time of the British annexation in 1885, leaving a minor as heir, and the administration at M\u00f6ng Mit was weak. It was included under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of the Northern Division instead of the Superintendent of the Northern Shan States. A pretender named Hkam Leng came to claim the title, but was rejected by the ministers. The Burmese prince Saw Yan Naing, who had risen up against the British, fled to the area and joined forces with Hkam Leng, and caused a great deal of trouble in 1888\u201389 for the Hampshire Regiment stationed at Momeik. Sao Hkun Hkio , Saopha of M\u00f6ng Mit, was one of the seven Saophas on the Executive Committee of the Shan State Council formed after the first Panglong Conference in March 1946. On 16 January 1947, they sent two memoranda, whilst a Burmese delegation headed by Aung San was in London , to the British Labour government of Clement Attlee demanding equal political footing as Burma proper and full autonomy of the Federated Shan States. He was not one of the six Saophas who signed the Panglong Agreement on 12 February 1947. The Cambridge -educated Sao Hkun Hkio became Burma's longest-serving Foreign Minister after independence in 1948 until the military coup of Ne Win in 1962, with only short interruptions, the longest of which was from 1958 to 1960 during Ne Win's caretaker government . After independence The Shweli river valley and the hills around Momeik and Mogok had been strongholds of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) as early as the 1950s, but only in 1968 did the 1st Brigade of the CPB People's Army regain control of the area, briefly capturing Momeik in 1977. Their plan to strike west to the plains north of Mandalay was thwarted by clashes with the Shan State Army and the Palaung State Liberation Army as well as government military offensives. The Shan State Army-North's 3rd Brigade has been active in Momeik, Kyaukme, Hsipaw, Namtu and Lashio. It reached a cease-fire agreement with the Burmese military government (SLORC) in 1989, and its activities have been severely curtailed. In 2005, an attempt by the Shan State Army-South based near the Thai border to fill the vacuum left by the cease-fire in the north was thwarted by the Burmese army . During the Myanmar Civil War , the town was temporarily taken by the Kachin Independence Army but retaken by the Tatmadaw on 2 January 2024. The junta counter-offensive destroyed large parts of the town and the fighting left scores of civilians dead. The Ta'ang National Liberation Army launched a renewed offensive on the town in July 2024, as part of their resumption of Operation 1027 . The TNLA withdrew from Momeik after a China-brokered ceasefire on 29 October 2025. Economy Minerals Momeik is famous for its precious and semi-precious stones. Elbaite , a variant of Rubellite ( Tourmaline or Anyant meaning 'inferior' in Burmese ) including the \"mushroom\" tourmaline, and Petalite or Salinwa are mined in this region. Diamond found in Momeik region is believed to derive from primary sources in northwestern Australia but distinguishable from similar stones from eastern Australia. Gold mining in the area is being operated by Asia World and Shweli Yadana. Agriculture Mogok ruby mines rely on the staple Momeik rice . Hsinshweli strain high-yield rice as well as sugar cane , rubber , physic nut , jengkol bean and avocado are cultivated in the region. Notes ^ \"Train Travel in Myanmar (Burma)\" . seat61.com .

Born at Yatala (now Rosewater ) near Port Adelaide, South Australia , Thompson was the sixth child of Joseph Thompson and Jane Ann Batey, both of Northumberland , England . Thompson married Millicent Maud Garnaut on 19 January 1909 and initially farmed near Keith in southeast South Australia before a drought in 1914 led to their return to Port Adelaide. In 1930 Thompson was elected President of the Carters and Drivers Union, (later the Transport Workers Union ). His influence in the union movement led to his preselection as the Labor Party candidate for the safe Labor seat of Port Adelaide at the 1930 South Australian election. After the institution of single-member electorates in the South Australian House of Assembly in 1938, Thompson successfully transferred to Semaphore , serving there until 1946. He also served as president of the South Australian branch of the ALP from 1938 to 1940. In 1946 Thompson resigned from state parliament to successfully run as the Labor candidate for the federal seat of Hindmarsh , based on Port Adelaide, in the House of Representatives . After most of the northern portion of Hindmarsh was transferred to the new seat of Port Adelaide ahead of the 1949 election , Thompson transferred there and won easily. Thompson retired from politics at the 1963 election . References ^ \"Albert Thompson\" . Former members of the Parliament of South Australia .

In this sense, sensitization is the term more often in usage for induction of allergic responses . To bind antibodies to cells such as erythrocytes in advance of performing an immunological test such as a complement-fixation test or a Coombs test . The antibodies are bound to the cells in their Fab regions in the preparation. To bind antibodies or soluble antigens chemically or by adsorption to appropriate biological entities such as erythrocytes or particles made of gelatin or latex for passive aggregation tests. Those particles themselves are biologically inactive except for serving as antigens against the primary antibodies or as carriers of the antigens . When antibodies are used in the preparation, they are bound to the erythrocyte or particles in their Fab regions. Thus the step follows requires the secondary antibodies against those primary antibodies, that is, the secondary antibodies must have binding specificity to the primary antibodies including to their Fc regions .

There was controversy as First Division side, Dunfermline Athletic , fielded an ineligible player in their match against Stenhousemuir . As well as this, the club's management failed to register the two mandatory under-21 players required by the rules and submitted an inaccurate team sheet. As a result of these breaches in the rules, Dunfermline Athletic were to be expelled from the competition and Stenhousemuir were to progress their stead. However following an appeal by the club, a committee decided that expulsion from the competition was too harsh a punishment and wasn't merited by what the club's management described as \"honest errors\". The club were given a reprieve along with fines and forfeits of benefits totalling around \u00a330,000. Furthermore, the result of the game was overturned was replayed at Ochilview Park to decide which team progressed in the competition.

{"id": "doc_random_246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Evergood", "text": "Miles Evergood (10 January 1871 \u2013 3 January 1939) was an Australian artist who achieved recognition in Europe and the United States, as well as his native country. He was the father of American artist Philip Evergood . Biography Evergood was born Myer Blashki in Melbourne, eleventh child of Phillip Blashki , manufacturer of masonic regalia and jeweller, and his wife Hannah, n\u00e9e Immergut. Evergood was educated at the Melbourne Hebrew Day School and Angel College, later crediting his ability to write and to argue to influential teachers there, especially Rev. Jacob Goldstein. Goldstein in 1908 wrote a front-page article about Evergood in the New York Hebrew Standard . He studied at the National Gallery School of Art under Frederick McCubbin and Bernard Hall between 1893 and 1895. His friends and colleagues were the group who exhibited the first recognisable style of Australian painting. They included Max Meldrum , George Coates , and James Quinn , who formed themselves into bohemian clubs to discuss contemporary concerns like socialism and the rights of the individual. Evergood moved to the United States in 1898 together with fellow-artist Frank (Francis) McComas. He worked for the Hearst newspapers in San Francisco before moving on to New York City, where he exhibited and was subsequently invited to be a member of both the Salamgundi and Lotos Clubs . He went to London, where he married Flora Jane Perry, whom he had probably met in Sydney. The family moved to New York, where art critics Henri Pene du Bois and James Huneker wrote glowingly of his works. as did Hanna Astrup Larsen in the glossy journal International Studio . Miles and Flora had one child, named Philip Howard Francis Dixon Blashki (1901\u20131973). In 1910 Miles exhibited five paintings in the first exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists held in New York. For about twenty years he regularly visited Europe. After returning with the family to live in England in 1910. In 1914 he had a landscape hung in the Salon (Paris) . For eight years he exhibited with the International Society, at Burlington House, with the Society of Painters and 'Gravers and the New English Arts Club. He changed his name to Miles Evergood about 1914 in London, to enable his son Philip to get a commission in the British Navy. Then-Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill wrote a handwritten reply to his query, suggesting that \"Blashki\" was not a suitable name for an officer in an Anglo Saxon navy. Evergood returned to Australia in July 1931 and worked for eighteen months in Queensland and became a member of the Royal Queensland Art Society. He died of cancer in Melbourne on 3 January 1939. He left a de facto partner, Pauline Konitzer Romero, and his son, Philip Evergood , who became an artist living in America, substantially eclipsing the career of his father Miles.

Aedesia ( Ancient Greek : \u0391\u1f30\u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 ) was a philosopher of the Neoplatonic school who lived in Alexandria in the fifth century AD. She was a relation of Syrianus and the wife of Hermias , and was equally celebrated for her beauty and her virtues. After the death of her husband, she devoted herself to relieving the wants of the distressed and the education of her children, Ammonius and Heliodorus . She accompanied the latter to Athens , where they went to study philosophy, and was received with great distinction by all the philosophers there, and especially by Proclus , to whom she had been betrothed by Syrianus, when she was quite young. She lived to a considerable age, and her funeral oration was pronounced by Damascius , who was then a young man, in hexameter verses.

History The club was founded in 2012 in Ait Iaaza , located in the Taroudant Province . The region lacks a dedicated stadium for training and hosting opposing teams. As a result, the club plays its matches at the municipal stadium in Taroudant, where it also trains twice a week. For additional training sessions, the team is forced to practice in open spaces. In the 2014\u201315 season, the club claimed the second division title, earning promotion to the first division . However, they were immediately relegated in the following season. They bounced back to the top flight in 2017 and continued to improve, achieving a fourth-place league finish in 2018. The 2019\u201320 season marked a historic moment for Ait Iaaza, as they reached the final of the Moroccan Women's Throne Cup . This success was followed by their runner-up finish in the league during the 2020\u201321 season.

The game was played at Triborough Stadium on New York City's Randall's Island . Fordham won the game 34\u20137. Broadcast by NBC , the contest was the first American football game ever televised. Game play Fordham entered the game a pre-season pick for the national championship , but the first score was completed by Waynesburg when Bobby Brooks completed a 63-yard run for a touchdown on the third play of the game. Waynesburg only scored in the first quarter but managed to keep Fordham within reach during the early part of the game. Fordham scored in every quarter, leaving the final score at 34\u20137. Fordham's offense managed sixteen first downs and 337 yards, while Waynesburg managed only five first downs for a total of 157 yards. Fordham blocked a punt in both the first and second halves of the game and recorded an interception in the fourth quarter that the offense was able to turn into a touchdown. Sports broadcasting firsts NBC broadcast the game on station W2XBS with one camera and Bill Stern was the sole announcer. Estimates are that the broadcast reached approximately 1,000 television sets. The game came just over a month after the Brooklyn Dodgers hosted the Cincinnati Reds in the first-ever televised professional baseball game, and five months after the Princeton and Columbia baseball teams played the first televised American sporting event. Sports broadcasting continued less than one month later on October 22 with a telecast of a game between the now-defunct Brooklyn \"Football\" Dodgers and the Philadelphia Eagles at Ebbets Field . Brooklyn won 24\u201314 in what became the first televised professional football game. On February 28, 1940, the University of Pittsburgh played Fordham at Madison Square Garden in the first televised basketball game. College football on television continued with the second televised college game just one month later, on October 28, when the Kansas State Wildcats hosted the Nebraska Cornhuskers for their homecoming contest.

{"id": "doc_random_252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufia_%26_the_Fortress_of_Doom", "text": "Lufia & the Fortress of Doom , known as Estpolis Denki ( \u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u30dd\u30ea\u30b9\u4f1d\u8a18 , Esutoporisu Denki ; officially translated Biography of Estpolis ) in Japan, is a role-playing video game developed by Neverland and published by Taito in 1993 , for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System . It is the first title in the Lufia series of video games and the only game from the series released under the Taito label in North America. The game's plot follows The Hero, Lufia, Aguro, and Jerin on a quest to prevent the resurrection of four superpowered beings called Sinistrals, and frequently delves into the political and personal lives of the subjects of kingdoms all around the world. Top-down exploration is mixed with traditional turn-based combat using 2D sprites. The game was generally well-received, and has spawned multiple sequels on the Super Nintendo as well as the Game Boy Color , Game Boy Advance and the Nintendo DS . Gameplay Lufia & the Fortress of Doom plays much like a traditional role-playing video game and features 2D character sprites and environments. The player advances the story by travelling through several harsh dungeons, encountering monsters along the way. These battles occur randomly (every few steps or so) or in scripted situations, and winning them yields experience points that go towards leveling up the characters, giving them access to new abilities and making them stronger in the process. The battles themselves take place from a first-person perspective, and require the player to use each character's strengths, such as physical attacks or magic use, as in many other mainstream RPGs. An interesting quirk in the battle system, reminiscent of older RPGs like the early Dragon Quest games, makes it such that when ordering two characters to attack a particular enemy, and the first character defeats the enemy, the second character's attack will still target the defeated enemy and thus miss. Thus foresight is required to make sure that no characters' battle moves are wasted, unlike other RPGs, where other enemies will be targeted if the intended enemy has already been defeated. New equipment and restorative items are purchased from vendors in various towns, or found in chests scattered throughout the world. The player's progress is saved in one of three available slots on the cartridge's built-in battery back-up system by speaking to a priest at a church found in most towns. Plot Setting The player character when in-town The story of Lufia & the Fortress of Doom begins, in accordance with an ancient prophecy of the Lufia world, with a massive floating island with a large castle located on it emerging into the sky one dark day. Dubbed the \"Fortress of Doom\", this castle served as the base of operations for a group of all-powerful beings known as the Sinistrals, who planned to use their strength to bring the world to its knees. In response, the people sent four of their bravest warriors: Maxim, Selan (\"Serena\" in Estopolis Denki), Artea (\"Arty\" in Estopolis Denki), and Guy, to infiltrate the dark fortress and destroy the Sinistrals before they could do any harm. The game begins with the player controlling these characters as they prepare to engage the Sinistrals, and eventually defeat them. After the battle, however, the fortress begins to collapse, with Maxim and Selan becoming trapped on the other side of a deep chasm that forms when the Sinistral throne room splits apart. Unable to teleport them to safety, Artea and Guy leave the falling island alone, and their trapped allies apparently perish when it crashes into the earth below. Peace reigns for ninety years after the heroes' encounter with the Sinistrals, and the actual game is set nine years after that. The story is told from the perspective of a red-haired boy the player is in charge of naming, and along the way he gets caught up in a struggle to save the world once again from the newly emerged Sinistral army. Story A red haired boy who is a descendant of Maxim is playing in a field and is approached by a mystery girl who wants to join him in play. She introduces herself as Lufia and grows up with the boy, forming a close bond. Years later the boy grows up into a warrior and his attention is turned to an attack on a neighboring Kingdom to the north, where it is revealed that The Sinistral Gades is heading the attack. The warrior barely survives, and the presence of Lufia halts Gades attack. Lufia joins the warrior and it is revealed that Gades was only the first to be revived, and the other three will soon arrive to terrorize the world. They are joined by another warrior, Aguro, and set out to find the remaining members of Maxim's old party. However, Guy is now too old, and he dies at the shock of the Sinistrals return. Artea still lives, however he is more accepting of his advanced years despite his elven blood, and hands down his old bow to Jerin, an elf girl who joined the new party on their quest and a rival for the warrior's affection. The party sets out to find the Dual Blade, the sword Maxim used in the first war, not knowing that it was originally created by the Sinistrals. They find their old fortress below sea level, where Amon and Daos are encountered. They reveal that their sister Erin was already revived 30 years prior to the current war, and later as part of their trap the Dual Blade reacts on its own and affects Lufia, and revives her true identity as Erin herself. She joins the Sinistrals in the rising Fortress of Doom. The warrior and the remaining party set out to defeat them, infiltrating the Fortress, as did Maxim those years ago. Gades, Amon, and Daos are defeated, and Erin is swayed back as Lufia when her brother Sinistrals fuse to become a final monstrous entity. The party prevails, though Lufia elects to remain behind as the Fortress falls again. Peace reigns once more, though the Warrior is distraught over the loss of Lufia, until one day she returns to him, having no memory of her past life as either Erin or Lufia. The red-headed descendant of Maxim elects to stay with her, and help her to live her new life. Characters Playable characters \"The Hero\" is the primary character of the story that the player gets to name. He grew up in a small town of Alekia and was raised by a man named Roman, a friend of his father (who had died in a battle long ago). Very skilled in swordplay , The Hero prefers to fight in close quarters, and wears heavy armor, though he does have some degree of magical skill, usually healing and defense spells. He is said to be a descendant of the great hero Maxim who vanquished the Sinistrals and saved the world. Lufia is the Hero's best friend whom he has known since childhood. She is bossy, but proficient in spellcasting. She has a romantic interest in The Hero and helps him in any way she can. She fights with wands and other lightweight weapons such as flails and even frying pans. Lufia utilizes Thunder, Water and Explosion magic as well as numerous support spells. Aguro is the leader of the army of the nation of Lorbenia. He is a hardened warrior who is interested in the Hero's fighting ability. Having no skill in magic, he instead relies on his brute strength and skill with swords, axes and lances. He, like the Hero, can equip heavy armor to increase his defense. Jerin is a half-elf who, because of her heritage, has an increased lifespan and actually appears younger than she is. Agile, and good with magic, Jerin prefers to fight at a distance, using either a bow and arrow or wands in combat. She is proficient with Fire and Ice magic and is a master of healing. Battle mode Starting characters At the start of the game (introduction): Maxim is the original leader of the group who went after the Sinistrals years ago his name and his descendants went down in legend. Selan is Maxim's wife and a powerful magic user but is not as strong with melee attacks. Guy is a longtime friend of Maxim who has no knowledge of magic himself but is physically the most powerful character. Artea is an elf who can attack all targets with his bow and has a decent amount of magic. Artea lives through both comings of the Sinistrals due to the long lifespan of an elf. Antagonists The Sinistrals are a group of four powerful, god-like warriors who plan on taking over the world. From their floating Fortress of Doom, they gathered their strength, only to be defeated by Maxim and his friends years ago. Their ranks include Gades, Master of Destruction, an overbearing and proud warrior clad in dark armor; Amon, Master of Chaos, a resourceful man who wears gold armor and wields a trident; Erim, Mistress of Death, who can revive any of her brothers if they fall in combat; and Daos, Master of Terror, their leader, an incredibly powerful sorcerer. Due to a mistake, however, in the English version Daos and Amon have their titles reversed. Daos is the Master of Chaos (Infernos in the Dutch version), while Amon is the Master of Terror; this is the only game in the series where this localization error occurs. Development Taito began to develop a port of Lufia & the Fortress of Doom for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis , but the game, primarily intended for a North American release, was not released because of Taito America's closure in 1995. [1] At least two full-page advertisements were made in U.S. magazines, the second one announcing a delay to spring 1995, with the tagline \"It's worth the wait\". A ROM image of the Mega Drive version was leaked online in 2014 by a former programmer of the port. Reception Reception In the United States, it was the top-selling Super NES game in February 1994 . Upon release, Electronic Games scored it 93%, calling it \"the best RPG so far this year\". In Dragon , Sandy Petersen gave the game 3 out of 5 stars. GamePro gave it ratings of 4.5/5 for graphics, 4/5 for sound, 4/5 for control and 4.5/5 for overall fun factor. Lufia was runner-up for GamePro 's 1993 Role-Playing Game of the Year award, which was won by Secret of Mana . Retrospectively, the game has received positive to mixed reviews. Some reflect on it fondly for its story and characters, while others criticize it as being inferior to other console RPGs of that era, such as Secret of Mana , the Final Fantasy titles, or its prequel Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals .

Charles Bingham Penrose (October 6, 1798\u00a0\u2013 April 6, 1857) was an American politician who served as a Democratic-Republican and Whig member of the Pennsylvania Senate for the 16th and 14th district from 1833 to 1841 and as a Republican member for the 1st district in 1857. He served as Speaker of the Pennsylvania Senate from 1838 to 1839 and again in 1841. He was a key figure during the Buckshot War unrest in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, after the 1838 legislative election, when both Whigs and Democrats claimed control over the Pennsylvania House of Representatives . He served as Solicitor of the United States Treasury from 1841 to 1845 in the William Henry Harrison and John Tyler administrations and as the first Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in 1849 during the Zachary Taylor administration. Early life Penrose was born in the Frankford neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , on October 6, 1798, to Clement Biddle Penrose and Anna Howard Bingham. He moved with his family to St. Louis, Missouri , when his father was assigned as commissioner of the Louisiana Territory by President Thomas Jefferson . He volunteered to fight during the War of 1812 , however the St. Louis based company was never called into active service. Penrose studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1821.

Buckshot War Main article: Buckshot War Penrose was a key figure during the Buckshot War of 1838, when both the Whig and Democratic parties claimed control over the Pennsylvania House of Representatives . Penrose certified the Whig results from Philadelphia for the Senate which prompted Charles Brown , one of the rejected candidates, to request to speak. A crowd of hundreds armed with bowie knives and pistols were in attendance to support the Democratic side. They began to shout \"You shall admit Brown and Stevens (another Democratic candidate)\" and \"We will have Burrowes', Stevens', and Penrose's blood\". Penrose, Thaddeus Stevens and Secretary of Commonwealth Thomas H. Burrowes fled the Capitol through a window in the back of the Senate chambers to escape the mob. Governor Joseph Ritner declared a rebellion and Pennsylvania State Milita General Robert Patterson came to Harrisburg with troops to quell any potential violence. Both Penrose and Governor Ritner wrote to Captain Edwin Vose Sumner in command of Federal troops in Carlisle to also come to Harrisburg, however Vose refused to interfere in what he deemed a state political matter.

Biography Early life George Rueger was born on September 23, 1929, in Framingham, Massachusetts , the son of Edward G. and Mary T. (Reddy) Rueger. He attended Framingham South High School and St. Peter High School in Worcester. After attending the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester from 1949 to 1950, he entered Cardinal O\u2019Connor Minor Seminary in Boston. He completed his studies for the priesthood at Saint John's Seminary in Boston. He also did post-graduate studies at Harvard University . Priesthood Rueger was ordained a priest by then Bishop John J. Wright on January 6, 1958, for the Diocese of Worcester at St. Paul Cathedral in Worcester. After his ordination, Rueger was appointed as an assistant pastor at Our Lady of Lourdes Parish in Millbury, Massachusetts . He was later transferred to St. Peter Parish in Worcester. In 1965, Rueger was appointed as headmaster of Marian Central Catholic High School, Worcester. He became assistant pastor in 1974 of Our Lady of the Lake Parish in Leominster, Massachusetts . In 1976, Rueger was elected president of the diocesan Senate of Priests and appointed pastor of Sacred Heart of Jesus Parish in Hopedale, Massachusetts , in 1977. On August 1, 1978, Rueger became superintendent of Catholic schools for the diocese while continuing his pastoral assignment in Hopedale. On Dec. 1, 1980 he returned to full-time ministry in Hopedale. In 1981, he was named pastor of St. Peter Parish. Auxiliary Bishop of Worcester On January 16, 1987, Pope John Paul II appointed Rueger as an auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Worcester and titular bishop of Maronana. He was consecrated by Bishop Timothy Harrington on February 25, 1987. He was appointed as vicar general for the diocese and 1998 also became moderator of the curia . In July 2002, Rueger was sued by a man who claimed he sexually abused him when he was a 13 year old altar boy. Rueger denied all the charges. Sime Braio claimed that Rueger started abusing him when he was a priest at Our Lady of Lourdes Parish. The diocese had previously investigated the allegations and determined them to be false. Notified of the allegations, the district attorney declined to prosecute Rueger. Braio dropped the lawsuit in 2003. Retirement In 2004, having reached the mandatory retirement age of 75 for bishops, Rueger submitted his resignation as bishop of the Diocese of Worcester to Pope John Paul. That same year, the Vincent de Paul Society gave Rueger its Collaborative Award for Education and Ministry award. On January 25, 2005, Pope Benedict XVI accepted Rueger's resignation. George Rueger died on April 6, 2019, at the age of 89.

{"id": "doc_random_256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opal_Dream", "text": "Opal Dream (also known as Pobby and Dingan ) is a 2006 drama film, based on the 2000 Ben Rice novella Pobby and Dingan , directed by Peter Cattaneo and starring an ensemble cast including Vince Colosimo , Jacqueline McKenzie , Christian Byers and Sapphire Boyce . It was filmed on location around South Australia , in Adelaide , Coober Pedy and Woomera . Opal Dream was released in Australia on 28 September 2006, with eventual release around the world. Plot Kellyanne ( Sapphire Boyce ) is led by her brother Ashmol ( Christian Byers ). The film begins by introducing Kellyanne Williamson, playing with imaginary friends Pobby and Dingan. The family of Rex Williamson\u2014his wife, Anne, daughter Kellyanne and son Ashmol\u2014have moved to Coober Pedy , known as the \"opal capital of Australia\", because Rex believed he could make a fortune in mining opal . So far he's had little success. Ashmol, while he loves his sister, is frequently annoyed when she talks to her imaginary friends, and some of the kids at school tease the siblings because of them. Rex and Anne decide it is time to separate Kellyanne from her invisible companions. Annie takes Kellyanne to a Christmas party at Annie's friend's house, Rex telling her that he will let Pobby and Dingan come with him to go opal mining. Upon Rex's return, Kellyanne says she can no longer see them and that they have disappeared. She insists on going to the opal mining area to look for them, accompanied by Rex and Ashmol. The family accidentally strays on to a neighbouring miner's claim . The miner, Sid, pulls a shotgun on Rex and calls the police, thinking that Rex was \"ratting\" on his territory - that is, looking for opals on his turf. Kellyanne is grief-stricken at the loss of her imaginary friends and takes ill, although doctors can find nothing physically wrong with her. Rex has to leave his opal claim. Annie loses her job at the local supermarket, thanks to the circulating rumours around Rex's arrest. Convinced that Kellyanne is faking her illness, Ashmol nonetheless goes along with her wish that he try to find Pobby and Dingan. He even comes up with the idea of putting posters around town. Ultimately, returning to his father's mine area, Ashmol finds two lollipop wrappers. Deeper in the tunnel, he finds a large opal which he takes back to Kellyanne. He tells her he has found Pobby and Dingan, and that they are dead. Kellyanne, whose sickness has been worsening, has to go to hospital. Ashmol sells his opal and pays for a funeral for Pobby and Dingan. He has made friends with a lawyer, who takes Rex's case. Rex wins the trial. Many people in town begin to feel that their attitude toward Kellyanne and her family may have contributed to her sickness. These people show up at Pobby and Dingan's funeral. Kellyanne, though still sick, is there, and throws lollipops into her imaginary friends' graves. A short time later, Kellyanne herself dies, and is buried between her imaginary friends. Ashmol visits her grave. Rex gets his claim back, and Ashmol is allowed to accompany him on mining trips. Ending In the original release of the film, the death of Kellyanne was not shown; after Pobby and Dingan's funeral, the screen fades to white, and the film ends. This cut was made against the wishes of the director and crew but did air uncut and as originally intended when shown on BBC Two in 2008. Cast Production and distribution The film was financed by the BBC and produced through Academy Films . The film was commercially released on Amazon in 2007, and is available as region 1 and 2 DVDs. Reaction The film has had some early critical success at various international film festivals, including the 2005 Berlin International Film Festival and the 2006 Melbourne International Film Festival . On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , the film holds an approval rating of 69% based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 6.14/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Earnest performances and Peter Cattaneo's sympathetic direction gives heart to the simple, timeworn script.\" Box office Opal Dream grossed $64,461 at the box office in Australia, and $140,666 worldwide See also Cinema of Australia South Australian Film Corporation References ^ \"Opal Dream (2006)\" .

History Triangle Access Broadcasting, Inc. was awarded the first construction permit to build an LPFM station in the Raleigh area, signing on in October 2003 at 107.9\u00a0MHz under the call sign WVDJ-LP . After nearly a decade on the air, in September 2013, the station would be reborn under a new frequency (moving from 107.9 to 93.5\u00a0MHz) and a new call sign, WRLY-LP . These changes were accompanied by a rebranding from \"Pulse FM\" to \"The Oak, 93.5.\" Positive changes would continue into 2014 as minor technical adjustments would result in significantly increased signal reach, and Triangle Access Broadcasting would reach agreement to syndicate certain programming during early morning hours. Format Oak 93.5's format predominantly features adult contemporary music. During morning hours, programming also features local personality John Van Pelt, who provides a variety of severe weather and disaster preparedness tips. Friday afternoon's is known as the hit music hour from 6 PM - 8 PM broadcast by local personality Walt.

It is very similar to another species with which it overlaps partly in range, Hydrophylax bahuvistara which extends further into parts of central India. Although restricted in range within peninsular India, they are of least conservation concern. Their upper parts vary in colour from brownish-red to bright crimson. Description Vomerine teeth in two oval oblique groups between the choanae. Head moderate, depressed; snout moderate, hardly as long as the diameter of the orbit, subacuminate, moderately prominent; loreal region concave; nostril nearer to the end of the snout than to the eye; interorbital space rather narrower than the upper eyelid; tympanum very distinct, nearly as large as the eye. fingers moderate, first extending beyond second; toes rather short, half webbed\u00a0: tips of fingers and toes swollen; subarticular tubercles very strong; inner metatarsal tubercle oval, blunt; a large rounded tubercle at the base of the fourth toe; no tarsal fold. The tibio-tarsal articulation reaches the tympanum or the eye. Skin finely granulate above; a broad, not very prominent glandular lateral fold; a strong glandular fold from below the eye to the shoulder, followed by one or two glandules. Head and body bright crimson above, blackish brown on the sides; back sometimes with a few small black spots; upper lip, and a series of spots on the flank, white; limbs blackish brown above, spotted and marbled with pale brown and while; beneath uniform white, or marbled brown and white.

{"id": "doc_random_260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_response_system", "text": "A rapid response system (RRS) is a system implemented in many hospitals designed to identify and respond to patients with early signs of clinical deterioration on non-intensive care units with the goal of preventing respiratory or cardiac arrest . A rapid response system consists of two clinical components, an afferent component, an efferent component, and two organizational components \u2013 process improvement and administrative. The afferent component consists of identifying the input early warning signs that alert a response from the efferent component, the rapid response team . Rapid response teams are those specific to the US, the equivalent in the UK are called critical care outreach teams , and in Australia are known as medical emergency teams , though the term rapid response teams is often used as a generic term. In the rapid response system of a hospital's pediatric wards a prequel to the rapid response team known as a rover team is sometimes used that continuously monitors the children in its care. Triggers Further information: Early warning score The afferent component, or identification limb, also known as the track-and-trigger system, uses standardized tools to track early signs of reversible clinical deterioration and trigger a call to, and response from the efferent component, or response limb. Examples of afferent tools include single-parameter calling criteria and multi-parameter early warning scores . These tools can predict clinical deterioration based upon the patient\u2019s medical condition, and detect deterioration through the patient\u2019s state such as a high respiratory rate . Single-parameter calling criteria require that only one criterion be met before activating the efferent component. Criteria may be based on vital signs , diagnoses, events, subjective observations, or concerns of the patient. Multi-parameter tools are more complex in that they combine several parameters into a single early warning score (EWS). Family activation METs were originally activated exclusively by bedside clinicians in need of emergency assistance. Recently, many hospitals have begun to allow families to activate a MET if they feel the care team is not adequately addressing their concerns. The team may differ in composition from the clinician-activated MET such as including a patient relations coordinator. Family-activated METs were put in place as a response to the preventable death of Josie King in 2001. King was 18-months old when she died at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore , from medical errors and delays in escalation of care despite her family\u2019s concerns. As a result of the highly publicized death, the Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh began a program called Condition HELP that allows families to activate a MET. Families receive training on Condition HELP when the patient is admitted and are asked to voice concerns to their care team before activating the MET. The Ryan's Rule initiative was trialled in some public hospitals in Queensland , Australia in 2013. It allows patients, their carers, friends and family to initiate a graduated escalation of care if they are concerned that the patient is not improving as expected. In 2016, Ryan's Rule was made available across all public hospitals in the Queensland Health system. Similar policies are called \"REACH\" in New South Wales and \"CARE\" in Australian Capital Territory . Martha's Rule was introduced in NHS England hospitals from April 2024. It is initially being rolled out in 100 hospitals. It will allow patients, their families and carers, and hospital staff, to access a rapid review by the critical care outreach team if they are worried about the patient's condition. Response The efferent component is a rapid response team \u2013 a multidisciplinary team trained in early resuscitation interventions, and advanced life support that rushes to the deteriorating patient\u2019s bedside to prevent respiratory and cardiac arrest in order to improve the patient\u2019s outcomes. The team is known in the US as a rapid response team (RRT), in the UK as a critical care outreach team (CCOT), and in Australia as a medical emergency team (MET), but rapid response team is also used generically.The team responds to calls placed by clinicians or families at the bedside who have detected deterioration. It may also provide proactive outreach to patients at high risk for deterioration. Composition of the teams may vary but often include one critical care attending physician or fellow , at least one nurse , and a respiratory therapist . Impacts and improvements The process improvement component uses evidence-based evaluation of the RRS to determine its effectiveness and to improve the system through targeted interventions. It works closely with the administrative component, clinicians (especially those on RRTs), and quality improvement experts to evaluate three measures: outcomes measures, process measures, and balancing measures. Outcomes measures Rates of hospital-wide mortality and respiratory and cardiac arrest, which are exceedingly rare and may or may not be preventable, are common outcome measures. Rapid response teams appear to decrease the rates of respiratory and cardiac arrest outside the intensive care unit . They also appear to decrease the chance of death in hospital. Overall effectiveness of rapid response teams is somewhat controversial due to the variability across studies as is the overall effectiveness of the rapid response system in improving patient safety . More recent work uses proximal outcome measures, such as the Children\u2019s Resuscitation Intensity Scale (measures level of care within 12 hours pre-transfer), the Clinical Deterioration Metric (measures level of care within 12 hours post-transfer), and UNSAFE transfers (measures level of care within 1 hour post-transfer). Process measures Process measures determine if the RRS is used as intended. Measures include the MET call rate, percentage of MET calls that result in transfer to the ICU, the time between initial physiologic abnormality and admission to ICU, timing of calls, reasons for MET calls, and evaluation of early warning scores using sensitivity and specificity . Balancing measures Balancing measures evaluate any unintended consequences of the RRS. Identified barriers to activating the MET include the primary team\u2019s overconfidence in their ability to stabilize the patient, poor communication, hierarchal problems, and hospital culture. Interventions to overcome barriers include improved intradisciplinary staff education, protocol requiring activation when calling criteria are met, and use of \u201cchampions\u201d to foster cultural change. Administrative component The administrative component oversees the planning, implementation, and maintenance phases for the RRS. A formal committee of frontline clinicians and ward and ICU leaders operate the administrative component. Cost effectiveness of RRS implementation has not been rigorously studied. History Lee and colleagues developed the first reported MET in 1995 in Liverpool Hospital in Australia. The first pediatric RRS was implemented in 2005 by Tibballs, Kinney, and colleagues at Royal Children\u2019s Hospital in Australia which included vital sign ranges that differed by age group. Since its development, the RRS has been implemented around the world. The RRS became a standard of hospitals in the U.S. after its promotion by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement in 2005 and the Joint Commission in 2008. Outside the U.S., RRS implementation has been encouraged and adopted by several national organizations, such as the Ministry of Health and Long-term Care in Canada, the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence , and the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare.

{"id": "doc_random_261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunnar_Dyrberg", "text": "Gunnar Dyrberg (12 \u00a0 November 1921\u00a0\u2013 8 \u00a0 January 2012) was a member of the Danish resistance movement during World War II . He was a leader of Holger Danske , a Danish resistance group in the capital Copenhagen , from 1943 to 1945. After the war, Dyrberg became a public administrator, holding several appointed positions in government, and later a public relations executive in banking. For more than 40 years, he also owned and operated a horse farm, breeding and training Icelandic horses in H\u00f8sterk\u00f8b , North Zealand . From 1994 to 2000, Dyrberg published novels and memoirs based on his experiences in the Danish resistance movement. He was featured in the 2003 Danish documentary film, With a Right to Kill ( Med ret til at dr\u00e6be ), based on the 2001 history by Peter \u00d8vig Knudsen . The book and film were part of some of the first efforts by Danes to seriously study issues raised by the liquidation of 400 persons by the Danish resistance during the war. The film featured news footage, interviews with surviving agents and leaders of the Resistance movement, and reconstruction of known events. Dyrberg's Holger Danske group was also the subject of Flame and Citron ( Flammen og Citronen, 2008), a Danish fictionalized dramatic film based on actions of its two most noted members, who were both killed by the Germans before the end of the war. Early life Dyrberg was born on 12 November 1921 in F\u00e5borg , Denmark and he grew up in Vesterbro, Copenhagen . In 1940, he studied mathematics at Vester Borgerdyd Gymnasium (now K\u00f8benhavns \u00e5bne Gymnasium , meaning Copenhagen's Open Gymnasium). Nazi occupation and resistance After Nazi Germany invaded Denmark (beginning 9 April 1940), Dyrberg was among the many young men who joined the Danish Resistance. He used the code name , \"Herman,\" to disguise his identity during the German occupation. He rose to lead group 5 of the Holger Danske , a resistance group in Copenhagen from 1943 to 1945. His activities included sabotage, military actions, leadership, and rescue. He was also a member of the illegal press. Dyrberg had a very close working relationship with Bent Faurschou-Hviid (\"Flame\") and J\u00f8rgen Haagen Schmith (\"Citron\"), two of the most noted members of the group. After the war, Dyrberg admitted that he had directed the killing of several German informants and soldiers, though the number has never been publicly revealed. He killed Hedvig Delbo on 9 March 1944, with Patrick Scultz, and he killed Erik Victor Pedersen. The Gestapo hunted him, requiring Dyrberg to jump out of a window on three occasions as he was being shot at. He moved 30 times in six months to avoid being captured. By the spring of 1944, there were only three members of Holger Danske that remained out of a group of 25, many killed on the same day. Lillelund, who had fled to Sweden, returned to Copenhagen to lead the group. Knud Larsen and others returned to Holger Danske, affiliating with Frode Jacobsen's organization, Ringen (the Ring), having freed themselves of Dansk Samling ( Danish Unity ). In 1945, Dyrberg was appointed head of the Resistance Press Office. For decades after the war, issues related to the choices of Danish targets to be liquidated were not much discussed; politicians wanted to support the resistance in the postwar effort to rebuild their society. Further information: Rescue of the Danish Jews Post-war years He went to college after the war, studying politics, receiving a degree in 1948 at the University of Copenhagen . World War II economic recovery programs From 1946 to 1947, he was with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He worked in Germany temporarily as the head of the British headquarters of the Danish military mission. He worked for the government on programs to implement the Marshall Plan , serving in the Directorate for Commodity Supply, a trade policy department (1948\u201352), and in the productivity committee of the Ministry of Commerce, the predecessor of Denmark's Enterprise Fund (1952-1953). He helped improve the efficiency of industry, trade and commerce in Europe. He worked for the productivity centers of Italy and Greek as a consultant. In 1956 he worked as the head of the consultants and architects of the merchant service for De Samvirkende K\u00f8bmandsforeninger He developed cost standard figures for merchants 1956, 1957 and 1958. In 1959, he accepted a position at The Trades Council, a position he held until 1965. He was a member of trade ministerial committees and was secretary of Handv\u00e6rkets Oplysningsforbund. He continued to represent businesses, for instance the Federation of Merchant Associations. He re-entered government when appointed as Secretary of Craft, and worked in several trade ministry areas. Communications and literature He served as editor for several journals: one related to the Resistance, as well as professional magazines. This work included being editor of Holger Danske's Home Guard Association's magazine, 1946\u201348; the weekly magazine Building Trades , 1958\u201365; Danish Crafts 1960\u201362; Advice: The Danish Bank Staff Bulletin, 1966\u201385; Quarterly, Farmers' Bank's financial magazine, 1967\u201371; and Pondus Item, 1967\u201382; and the member magazine of the Danish Invest, 1987\u20131992. Dyrberg began writing fiction and memoirs to explore and share his experiences during the war. Beginning in 1994, he published several books: both novels and memoirs about his time in the Danish resistance movement . Banking and horsebreeding Beginning in 1966, Dyrberg worked at the Farmers' Bank (The Danish Bank beginning 1976). He was appointed the first head of public relations and information. Dyrberg retired as deputy director in 1987. From 1987 to 1992, ehwas the editor of the Danske Invest magazine. From 1971 until 2012, Dyrberg also owned and operated the Lille S\u00f8g\u00e5rd (Small Sogard), a farm for breeding and training Icelandic horses . It was located in H\u00f8sterk\u00f8b , North Zealand . Personal life In 1946, Dyrberg married Lulla and they had two sons together. Lulla died in 1998. Gunnar Dyrberg died at his home in H\u00f8rsholm following a long illness on 8 January 2012, at the age of 90. Popular culture Dyrberg was featured in the 2003 documentary film, With a Right to Kill ( Med ret til at dr\u00e6be ), about the Holger Danske group. The 2008 Danish dramatic film, Flame and Citron ( Flammen og Citronen ), featured two of his most prominent agents as the central characters, and portrayed the complex, morally ambiguous relations within the Resistance.

{"id": "doc_random_262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luzon_Volcanic_Arc", "text": "Smith Volcano in the Babuyan Islands The Luzon Volcanic Arc is a chain of volcanoes in a north\u2013south line across the Luzon Strait from Taiwan to Luzon . The name \"Luzon Volcanic Arc\" was first proposed by Carl Bowin et al. to describe a series of Miocene to recent volcanoes due to eastward subduction along the Manila Trench for approximately 1,200\u00a0km from the Coastal Range in Taiwan south to southern Mindoro in the Philippines. Islands that form part of the arc are the Eastern Coastal Range of Taiwan , Green Island, Taiwan , Orchid Island , Kaotai Rock , Mavudis or Y'ami Island , Mabudis , Siayan Island , Itbayat Island , Diogo Island , Batan Island , Unnamed volcano Ibuhos , Sabtang Island , Babuyan , Didicas , and Camiguin de Babuyanes . At the south end it terminates on Luzon . The geochemistry of a number of volcanoes along the arc have been measured. There are five distinct geochemical domains within the arc (Mindoro, Bataan, Northern Luzon, Babuyan, and Taiwan). The geochemistry of the segments verified that the volcanoes are all subduction related (e.g., strong niobium anomalies and calc-alkaline characteristics). Isotopes and trace elements show unique geochemical characteristics in the north. Geochemical variations northward (Babuyan segment) were due to the subduction of sediments derived from the erosion of continental crust from China and Taiwan. There is a distinct increase in strontium isotopic ratios with latitude northward. This supports the conjecture that the variations were due to an increasing \"crustal\" component in subducted sediments as the continental blocks in the north were approached (China and Taiwan). The sediment thicknesses increased toward the north along the trench. The geochemistry and tectonic setting of the southern Luzon arc has been studied in detail. The geochemistry suggested that continental crust (probably from sediments) played an important role in the Macolod corridor and the Mindoro segments. Crustal collision had occurred in the south between the North Palawan-Mindoro crustal block and perhaps sediment contamination was derived from this region. This substantiates preliminary early isotope and trace element studies on the central Luzon arc Further work was done on the northern Luzon arc by McDermott et al. who found systematic variations in an assortment of isotopes with latitude not only in the lavas analyzed over the 500\u00a0km section of the arc but also in sediments along the trench. The only way to explain the latitudinal variations was through the addition of an increasing input of terrigenous sediments toward the continental regions in the north China and Taiwan During the Middle Miocene , 16-15 Ma , activity started in Taiwan. Batan Island volcanics are dated at 9.36 Ma, while north of Luzon, the volcanic islands are younger than 6.5 Ma.

It is run at Aintree over a distance of about 2 miles and 1 furlong (2 miles and 209 yards, or 3,410 metres), and during its running there are nine hurdles to be jumped. The race is for novice hurdlers, and it is scheduled to take place each year during the Grand National meeting in early April. During the 1960s and early 1970s the race was called the Lancashire Hurdle, and it was subsequently known by several different sponsored titles.

The house was built in 1820, and \"is thought to have been designed by a pupil of Sir John Soane .\" It was built for the Rev Richard Hilton, and the architect may have been George Edgecombe of Ellesmere . Hilton was still living there in 1837, but by 1851, it was home to his son-in-law John Jones, who had married Hilton's daughter. It passed to their son, Hanmer Hilton Jones, who lived there until he died in 1935, aged 93. The house was sold and by mid-century was home to the Soames family. Work was later undertaken to remove some changes that occurred in the mid-1930s, including large water tanks in the roof space, lowered ceilings, a bathroom, internal walls and some metal windows. The internal layout and the window arrangement was restored, and a new en-suite bathroom was created within a former maid's cupboard. It was home to Major Frederic Evelyn Soames (who also lived in Nyeri , Kenya), who died there on 14 March 1967. He was the son of Frederick William Soames, who ran Soames Brewery , Wrexham. It has been listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England since May 1953. It has been home to former Conservative cabinet minister Owen Paterson and his late wife Rose Paterson , since at least 2008. Rose Paterson was found dead in woods near the house in 2020, and the coroner later returned a verdict of suicide. References ^ a b c \"Shellbrook Hill, Sodylt Shropshire\" . RIBA .

{"id": "doc_random_269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Later_Bitches", "text": "\" Later Bitches \" is the debut single by Greek music producer the Prince Karma. Solely composed by him, the song was released for digital download and streaming on 30 March 2018 by Panik Entertainment Group . In May 2018, the Prince Karma signed a record deal with Ultra Records , which was one of the labels to distribute the song internationally. The oriental and Balkan -influenced dance track contains spoken vocals and lyrics that address nightlife in a self-ironic manner. Music critics gave positive reviews of the song upon release, praising its catchiness and commercial appeal. Commercially, the song reached number one in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Russia, as well as number 10 in Romania. It also notably charted at numbers 17 and 36 in France in Germany, where Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique (SNEP) and Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI) awarded it gold certifications , respectively.

The Prince Karma also played the song live at multiple gigs, including at the 2019 NRJ DJ Awards, where it received a nomination in the Best Club Track category. Background and composition According to the Prince Karma's Spotify biography, he is of Greek origin. However, press articles have reported him being Turkish or Dominican among others; he addressed this discussion in a July 2019 interview with El Universal : \"They have told me that I am from Puerto Rico, on the networks they say that I am Turkish, others that I am from the Dominican Republic, they have told me that I am from so many countries and I feel good.\" Prior to releasing his debut single \"Later Bitches\" and signing a record deal with Ultra Records in May 2018, the Prince Karma frequently had disc jockey jobs in his youth. An editor of Radio Eska 's website noted his anonymity , pointing out in September 2018 there was little information about him online and that his Facebook profile had under 200 followers. Katrin Elsner of 1LIVE considers the Prince Karma's preference for the pink colour to act as his \" trademark \", with his Instagram account being \"reminiscent of a huge pile of cotton candy - everything is pink\".

Musically, it is a dance track that encompasses oriental and Balkan influences. It is layered with spoken lyrics\u2015including \"What the hell do you mean I have to wait in line / This is complete and total bullshit / If I show you my tits, will you let me in?\"\u2015which detail nightlife in a self-ironic manner. Reception Music critics gave positive reviews of the song upon its release. Elsner praised the track's catchy melody, whilst an editor of Songtexte.com wrote it \"clearly stands out from the crowd and immediately lures you onto the dance floor\". D\u00fcsseldorf Tonight's Daniel Hecht likened \"Later Bitches\" to the Hugel remix of El Profesor 's \" Bella ciao \" (2018) and predicted that it \"has what it takes to climb into the top 10\" of the German charts . For the staff of Radio Eska, the song was a \"contender for hit of the year\". An editor of NordNews labelled \"Later Bitches\" as \"cheeky, border-crossing\" and \"provocative\".

John Anthony Bell (born 1 November 1940) is an Australian actor, theatre director and theatre manager. He has been a major influence on the development of Australian theatre in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Early life Bell was born 1 November 1940 in Newcastle, New South Wales , to a bank manager father and elocutionist mother. As the oldest child, he grew up alongside three younger sisters and a brother. At age 9 or 10, he moved with his family to the town of Maitland, New South Wales where he was educated at the Marist Brothers College. At school, he studied Shakespeare, where he developed and performed one-man stage shows. At the age of 15, he developed aspirations to become a Shakespearean actor after seeing Laurence Olivier as Henry V on screen. Bell auditioned for National Institute of Dramatic Art's (NIDA's) first intake in 1958 and was accepted, but his parents and teachers convinced him to go to Sydney University instead, where he studied an arts degree. He graduated with English Honours in 1962. Career In 1963, the year after his university graduation, Bell joined the Old Tote Theatre Company , where he played the title role in Hamlet . Bell relocated to the United Kingdom in 1964, after winning a scholarship from the British Council, and was invited to join the Royal Shakespeare Company . He spent five years with them as an Associate Artist. He returned to Australia in 1969 and taught at National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA). In 1970, Bell co-founded the Nimrod Theatre Company in Sydney, and was Artistic Director, investing in producing Australian theatre. That same year, he directed the first production of The Legend of King O'Malley (a musical play based on the life of King O'Malley by Bob Ellis and Michael Boddy ), featuring Robyn Nevin and Kate Fitzpatrick . He also directed plays by leading playwrights David Williamson , Ron Blair , Peter Kenna and Louis Nowra , including Williamson's Travelling North , The Club and The Removalists and Kenna's A Hard God . In 1985 he resigned from his role at Nimrod Theatre in order to freelance as a director and actor. In 1990, he formed the Bell Shakespeare Company , performing and touring his own productions of Shakespeare's works. Amongst other plays, he has produced Hamlet , Romeo and Juliet , The Taming of the Shrew , Richard III , Pericles , Henry IV , Henry V , Julius Caesar , Antony and Cleopatra , The Comedy of Errors , The Merchant of Venice , The Tempest , King Lear , and Goldoni 's The Servant of Two Masters . His own roles for the company include Shylock , Richard III , Macbeth , Malvolio , Coriolanus, Leontes , Prospero , King Lear and Ulysses. He has also played Hamlet , Henry V , Berowne, Petruchio , Cyrano de Bergerac and Titus Andronicus . His performances in King Lear , Cyrano de Bergerac and Uncle Vanya were met with critical acclaim. In 2009, Bell directed the opera Madama Butterfly for Oz Opera , which toured throughout Australia. In 2011, he published the book \"On Shakespeare\", detailing his thoughts and reminiscences of playing Shakespeare for more than 50 years. In 2015, at the age of 75, Bell retired from running Bell Shakespeare , handing the reins over to his successor, Peter Evans. He has since engaged as a corporate speaker, performed poetry recitals with pianist Simon Tedeschi and taken on further stage roles, including the title role in The Father with Sydney Theatre Company . Additionally, in his spare time, he started the Bouddi Foundation, based on the NSW central coast, which assists emerging In 2021, Bell delivered the Boyer Lecture on the themes of \"Life Lessons from Shakespeare\", \"Order vs Chaos\", \"Shakespeare's Women\", and \"Imaginary Forces\". The lectures demonstrate the relevance of Shakespeare's works to today's issues of need for good governance, the danger of political self interest, and the need for gender inequality. Honours and awards In the 1978 New Year Honours , Bell was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). In the Queen's Birthday Honours of 1987 , he was named a Member of the Order of Australia (AM). In the 2009 Australia Day Honours , he was named an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO). In 2001 a painting of Bell by artist Nicholas Harding won the Archibald Prize . In 2003 the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard , presented Bell with the Cultural Leader of the Year Award. In 2016 he was awarded Australian Humanist of the Year (AHOY). In 2019 Bell was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of New South Wales . His achievements in theatre have been acknowledged by the Universities of Newcastle (1994), Sydney (1996) and New South Wales , all of whom have awarded him honorary Doctor of Letters degrees. Awards Personal life Bell attended the University of Sydney with Clive James and Germaine Greer . He is a contemporary and friend of Bruce Beresford (film director, with whom he shared a house and for whom he did some film acting), Ken Horler , Mungo McCallum , Bob Ellis , Richard Wherrett , John Gaden , Laurie Oakes (journalist), and Les Murray (poet). His brother is the artist Michael Bell. Bell met Polish-born Australian actress and NIDA graduate Anna Volska in 1963, when they performed in a production of The Cherry Orchard together. Volska followed Bell to the UK when he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company , and they married in 1965 in Stratford-upon-Avon, where their two daughters were born. The couple's daughters are playwright Hilary Bell (b. 1966) and Grass Roots actress Lucy Bell (b. 1968). Through their daughters, they have five grandchildren, the eldest of whom aspires to be a filmmaker. Bell and Volska reside in the Sydney suburb of Woollahra .

This gene encodes an enzyme that functions in the biosynthetic pathways of sialic acids . In vitro , the encoded protein uses N-acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate and mannose 6-phosphate as substrates to generate phosphorylated forms of N-acetylneuraminic acid ( Neu5Ac ) and 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (KDN), respectively. However, it exhibits much higher activity toward the Neu5Ac phosphate product. In insect cells, expression of this gene results in Neu5Ac and KDN production. This gene is related to the E. coli sialic acid synthase gene neuB, and it can partially restore sialic acid synthase activity in an E. coli neuB-negative mutant.

{"id": "doc_random_273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubus_armeniacus", "text": "Himalayan blackberry flower, Bay Area, California . Note spider on bottom petal. Rubus armeniacus , the Himalayan blackberry or Armenian blackberry , is a species of Rubus in the blackberry group Rubus subgenus Rubus series Discolores (P.J. M\u00fcll.) Focke. It is native to Armenia and northern Iran , and widely invasive elsewhere. Both its scientific name and origin have been the subject of much confusion. The plant is known for its highly edible berries (technically aggregate fruits ), which are large and sweet when ripe. Notably, the species was used in the development of the marionberry . Also known for its extreme vigor and tendency to spread rapidly over disturbed areas, it is considered a noxious weed and an invasive species in many regions. Description Rubus armeniacus is a perennial plant that bears biennial stems (\"canes\") from the perennial root system. In its first year a new stem grows vigorously to its full length of 4\u201310 m, trailing along the ground or arching up to 4 m high. The stem is stout, up to 2\u20133 centimetres ( 3 \u2044 4 \u2013 1 + 1 \u2044 4 \u00a0in) diameter at the base, and green; it is polygonal (usually hexagonal) in cross-section, with fearsome thorns up to 1.5\u00a0cm long forming along the ribs. The canes can turn more red/purple if they are exposed to bright sunlight. This is common in the summer. The leaves on first-year shoots are 7\u201320\u00a0cm long, palmately compound with either three or more commonly five leaflets. The leaflets are moderately serrated. Flowers are not produced on first-year shoots. In its second year, the stem does not grow longer, but produces several side shoots, which bear smaller leaves with three leaflets (rarely a single leaflet). These leaflets are oval-acute, dark green above and pale to whitish below, with a toothed margin, and snaring, hooked thorns along the midrib on the underside. The flowers are produced in late spring and early summer on panicles of 3\u201320 together on the tips of the second-year side shoots, each flower 2\u20132.5\u00a0cm diameter with five white or pale pink petals . The flowers are bisexual (perfect) containing both male and female reproductive structures. The fruit in botanical terminology is not a berry , but an aggregate fruit of numerous drupelets , 1.2\u20132\u00a0cm diameter, ripening black or dark purple. Both first- and second-year shoots are spiny , with short, stout, curved, sharp spines. Mature plants form a tangle of dense arching stems, the branches rooting from the node tip when they reach the ground. The fleshy growing cane tips contain the antifeedant compounds, 2-heptanol and methyl salicylate at higher concentrations than mature leaves. At the concentration found in the growing cane tips, 2-heptanol is a banana slug ( Ariolimax columbianus ) antifeedant. The lack of phytophagous insects observed on the growing cane tips is likely due to the presence of methyl salicylate. This compound is a known aphid repellant and has been shown to attract predators in response to insect herbivory. Taxonomy Both the scientific name and the species' origin have been the subject of much confusion, with much of the literature referring to it as either Rubus procerus or Rubus discolor , and often mistakenly citing its origin as western European. Flora of North America , published in 2014, considers the taxonomy unsettled, and tentatively uses the older name Rubus bifrons . As an invasive species Spread Luther Burbank , who popularized the misleading name \"Himalayan\", introduced Rubus armeniacus to North America in 1885 in Santa Rosa, California , using seeds that he imported from India. The species thrived in its new environment, notably for the large amount of berries it produced. By 1915, it was widely grown and cultivated in the United States. It soon escaped from cultivation , and became an invasive species in most of the temperate world and the U.S. Pacific Coast by 1945. It is listed as an invasive species in the U.S. State of Missouri and prohibited in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. Because it is so hard to contain, it quickly gets out of control, with birds and other animals eating the fruit and then spreading the seeds. It is highly flammable and a common ladder fuel for wildfires, due to the litter and dead canes produced by the plant. R. armeniacus bush covering a field in Germany It is especially established west of the Cascades in the American Pacific Northwest and in parts of southern British Columbia along the coast, in the Lower Mainland , and throughout Vancouver Island . It does well in riparian zones due to the abundance of other species in these areas, which allows it to go relatively unnoticed until it has had a chance to establish itself. Unlike other invasive species, this plant can easily establish itself and continue to spread in ecosystems that have not experienced a disturbance. The plant itself develops large root systems, allowing it to find water from other sources than just the immediate area. It can also hold onto water in its canes, allowing it to thrive more than other plants during dry seasons or droughts. Himalayan blackberries grow very well in sandy, well-drained soil with a lot of natural light, even if the soil is lacking in nutrients. All of the Himalayan blackberry's adaptations to grow in these conditions continue to make it a difficult plant to remove and an invasive species. R. armeniacus is able to survive during drought periods because of their extensive root systems. Not only are their roots spread out over a wide area, they also can go very deep underground, allowing them to reach water most smaller plants and shrubs would not reach. They also store more water in their canes that act like a water reservoir. This added water also allows them to release oxygen and take in more CO 2 without fearing major losses of water. Since they store water in their canes and roots, they have excess water ready for use or for loss when opening their stomata. Management Remnants of berries during winter near Frederikshavn , Denmark The plant\u2019s many means of asexual reproduction make it among the most difficult to control weeds in a home garden or small property management context. Cutting the canes to the ground, or burning thickets of Rubus armeniacus are ineffective removal strategies. The best practices for removal include digging up the rhizomes and connecting underground structures, and herbicides. Broken roots can resprout, making manual removal extra labor-intensive. Nonetheless, the plant rarely impedes large-scale construction or agricultural practices, since tillage, cutting, and other means of mechanical removal are sufficient to destroy a single generation of plants. Cultivation Berry crop An example of the drupes, showing both unripe (green then red) and two ripe drupes. The species was introduced to Europe in 1835 and to Australia and North America in 1885. It was valued for its edible fruit, similar to that of common blackberries (e.g. Rubus fruticosus ) but larger and sweeter, making it a more attractive species for both domestic and commercial fruit production. The immature fruits are smaller, red, and hard with a much more sour taste. The cultivars Himalayan Giant and Theodore Reimers are commonly planted. Rubus armeniacus was used in the cultivation of the Marionberry cultivar of blackberry. Cover When established for several years, if left alone Rubus armeniacus can grow into a large cluster of canes. These thickets can provide good nesting grounds for birds, and help to provide places to rest/hide for other slightly larger mammals, such as rabbits, squirrels, and beavers. While areas with R.\u00a0armeniacus provide good sources for bird nests, birds prefer areas with more natural/native plants when given the option.

For other uses, see Dairy (disambiguation) . The Dairy, Central Park, in 2013 The Dairy is a small building in Central Park in Manhattan , New York City , designed by the architect Calvert Vaux . The building was completed in 1871 as a restaurant but is now one of the park's five visitor centers managed by the Central Park Conservancy , and also contains a gift shop. The Dairy is located in the southern section of Central Park just south of the 65th Street transverse road. Adjacent features include the Central Park Carousel and the Heckscher Playground and Ballfields to the west, Sheep Meadow to the northwest, Central Park Mall to the north, Central Park Zoo to the east, The Pond and Hallett Nature Sanctuary to the southeast, and Wollman Rink to the south. History Design and construction The Dairy was included in the Greensward Plan , the winner of the 1857 competition for the design of Central Park, but construction of the building only began in September 1869. In a progress report written by Olmsted Vaux & Co. to the Department of Public Parks, dated June 6, 1870, the architects stated, \"The Dairy [is] a stone structure, the cellar of which connects directly with one of the traffic roads, it being the intention that the building should receive its main supplies from the exterior of the park. The Dairy is intended to serve as a refreshment room for adult visitors, and for the furnishing of supplies to parties of children who will congregate in the rustic shelter and in the play-grounds. The completion of this building, as designed in accordance with an estimate prepared in conjunction with the Architect-in-chief, will cost $3,000.\" The Dairy was incorporated into the Children's District, which was not part of the initial plans for Central Park. The district also included Playmates Arch , Heckscher Playground and Ballfields, the Chess & Checkers House, the now-demolished Children's Cottage, and the Central Park Carousel . As originally planned, the Dairy would be used as a place to buy milk and other small snacks, as well as borrow board games. The cows that provided the milk would be housed in the cottage's basement. However, after an incident regarding the sale of tainted milk, more stringent regulations were instituted in the 1860s. The game loans ultimately became the purview of the Children's Cottage. On the southern facade, a loggia or covered porch allowed visitors to enjoy the nearby Pond ; the portion of the pond facing the Dairy is now occupied by Wollman Rink . The building also contains several Gothic Revival elements including a great hall with large church-like windows, a spire, and a roof with a steep pitch . Decline The Dairy was completed in 1871, and following political pressure from legislator William Tweed , was used as a restaurant. In 1921, the restaurant operator Eugene Glenn paid an annual fee of $12,250 for the franchise. In the 1930s, Park Commissioner Robert Moses converted it to a storage facility, and by 1950, the building was in decline. That year, a reporter for The New York Times wrote that, \"untrimmed tree branches jut into its shingled roof,\" and \"leader pipes have long since separated from the gutters and sag uselessly.\" The loggia of the Dairy was demolished in 1955. The building was later closed altogether due to the New York City fiscal crisis of the 1970s. In the interim, it was used as a maintenance shed. Restoration and loggia reconstruction Restoration of the Dairy was identified in 1978 by Parks Commissioner Gordon Davis as a demonstration project that could prove the capacity of the Parks Department to restore and manage the city's decrepit parks system. The idea was to build public support -- especially among the affluent neighbors of Central Park -- that would translate into both private funding and political support for increased municipal appropriations. In 1979, the architects Weisberg, Castro Associates, following designs prepared in 1978 by the architect James R. Lamantia (1923\u20132011), restored the northern half of the structure, a renovation undertaken by the Central Park Community Fund and financed in part by Revlon, Inc. The renovated building reopened on November 17, 1979, with a polychrome information and sales desk designed by the architect Richard B. Oliver (1943-1985). In 1981, the Central Park Conservancy rebuilt the loggia that had been demolished in 1955. The loggia reconstruction was designed by James R. Lamantia and the firm of Russo + Sonder. Restoration (2020\u20132021) In 2016, the Conservancy began raising funds for the restoration of several structures in Central Park, including the Dairy. In September 2020, the Conservancy closed the building for restoration, and reopened it in November 2021. Gallery The Architect's sketch published in 1869.

{"id": "doc_random_276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosnarite", "text": "Kosnarite is an alkali zirconium phosphate mineral (KZr 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ) named after an expert of pegmatites Richard Andrew \"Rich\" Kosnar, well-known mineral dealer and collector from Colorado (November 13, 1946 - January 15, 2007). Kosnarite contains potassium , oxygen , phosphorus , and zirconium with sodium, rubidium , hafnium , manganese and fluorine (Na, Rb, Hf, Mn, and F) being common impurities found in kosnarite. It was discovered in nature for the first time in 1991 by Vandall T. King. Samples that were found in granitic pegmatites from the Mount Mica Quarry, Paris , Oxford County, Maine, US were sent to Eugene E. Foord for study. This became the first recorded case of naturally occurring kosnarite. Occurrence The first naturally occurring kosnarite was discovered in northern Maine in the United States. Another deposit was later found in Black Mountain, Oxford County, Maine . Both of these deposits were found in zoned granitic pegmatites associated with several minerals such as quartz , lepidolite , and beryl . Another deposit was found in Wycheproof , Northern Victoria, Australia, and this sample of kosnarite was also found in granitic pegmatite. Pegmatite is the term for a form of igneous rock with relatively large interlocking crystals, and there are three popular theories on how pegmatites named metamorphic , magmatic , and metasomatic . The pegmatites that the kosnarite are found in are believed to be formed by a mixture of magmatic and metamorphic as the kosnarite forms in the later stages of paragenesis by the alterations of hydrothermal fluids. Analysis Due to the rarity of kosnarite, forms of analysis that involve the powdering of the sample such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) can not be used, so other methods have to be used. To find the data that would have been provided by the XRD, a Gandolfi camera with an 114.6mm diameter was used to find the d-spacing and intensity. Kosnarite's density was found using the sink-float method while using an acetone mixture and methylene iodide . In order to find the chemical composition of kosnarite without damaging any sample, an ARL-SEMQ electron microprobe using an Opus microprobe automation system was used. To help find the chemical composition, CITZAF correction procedures were added to the study. Additionally, emission spectrographic analysis was completed by using a Jarrel-Ash 3.2-m spectrograph using a laser energy source. Chemical composition Properties The results of the testing found that kosnarite had large amounts of zirconium, phosphorus, and potassium. In the samples, there were also traces of calcium, zinc, and manganese, but these elements make up less than one percent, so they were classified as impurities. Physically, kosnarite from the pegmatites found in Maine occurred as rhombohedral crystals with a hexagonal unit cell and were pseudocubic with a maximum size of around 0.9 mm. This is important as zirconium is in the form of a six coordinated octahedron and potassium is structured in a shape called a trigonal antiprism that is also six coordinated. Kosnarite's structure was then determined by using [100] Patterson projection, and interatomic vector projection was also used to help determine the crystal structure. Special positions in the mineral were then found for potassium, zirconium, and phosphate while the two oxygen atoms had general positions. Multiple refinement cycles using a unit weighing system, and least-squares refinements were used to minimize the deviation of the shifting of the atoms. Later tests showed that zirconium polyhedra groups were joined by groups of phosphate these are both connected to each other by oxygen atoms. However, the oxygens are always bridges between the zirconium and phosphate and one oxygen is never shared between two the same groups and half of the oxygens are also shared with K groups. The pattern of two zirconium polyhedron, one potassium polyhedron, two zirconium polyhedron, and the oxygen and phosphate groups filling in the gaps creates kosnarite's unique crystal structure. Depending on the impurities present in the sample, the color of kosnarite can range from pale blue to blue-green depending on the amount of iron, manganese, or other impurities, and kosnarite can sometimes appear to be nearly colorless. Other physical properties of kosnarite include its vitreous lust, non-fluorescence, a hardness of 4.5 on the mohs scale of mineral hardness , conchoidal fracturing, and perfect cleavage in the {102} direction. Structurally, kosnarite is part of the hexagonal crystal family meaning that the crystals have three or six-fold symmetry and has a space group of R 3 c. The unit cell of kosnarite was calculated to be a = 8.687\u00a0 \u00c5 , c = 23.877\u00a0\u00c5; V = 1,560.45 \u00c5 3 , and no twinning growth has been observed. It was discovered that kosnarite is uniaxial (+) with its axes being N w = 1.656(2), N c = 1.682(2), and being nonpleochronic. Due to the small number of available samples, some tests have not been carried out, such as infrared spectra. Related minerals Kosnarite is part of the alkali zirconium phosphates in which there are only two other known members of this group: gainesite , and a Cs analogue of gainesite.

It was the first and only Nationwide Championship ever played, including the participation of Albanian and Kosovan teams at an official football event. This event is still not officially recognized from AFA , but in December 2012 the Albanian sports media have reported that this championship, along with the other two championships of World War II is expected to be recognized soon. Overview 1942 Albanian National Championship was the 10th season of Albania 's annual main competition. It started on 14 June 1942, and ended on 29 June 1942. Ten teams were separated in one group of 4 teams and two groups of 3 teams, playing single round-robin system. Two first teams of the bigger group and only the first team of other two smaller groups would go into the semifinals. North Zone teams were: Shkodra, Prishtina, Peja and Prizreni. Middle Zone teams were: Tirana, Elbasani and Durr\u00ebsi. South Zone teams were: Gjirokastra, Berati and Kor\u00e7a. KF Tirana won the championship.

The Renaissance Riverview Plaza Hotel is the third-tallest building and largest hotel in Mobile and the tallest hotel in the state of Alabama. Upon its completion, the 374-foot (114\u00a0m) and 277-unit Stouffer's Hotel (later Adam's Mark Hotel) became the second-tallest hotel in Mobile, after the 325-foot (99\u00a0m) Mobile Marriott , and the third-tallest building in the city. The building later fell to fourth-tallest upon the 1994 completion of the 325-foot (99\u00a0m) City-County Administration Building . The building underwent a $5 million renovation ( USD ) in 2002, and in 2008 a large spire was constructed over the existing structure. The spire was designed to complement the spire of the RSA Battle House Tower ; in shape and design, the two structures are nearly identical. With the addition of the spire, the Renaissance Riverview Plaza Hotel reached a new height of 374 feet (114\u00a0m), allowing it to surpass the Mobile Marriott and City-County Administration Building to become the third-tallest building in the city and the tallest hotel in the state.

{"id": "doc_random_280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mander_family", "text": "Coat of arms of the Mander family The Mander family has held for over 200 years a prominent position in the Midland counties of England, both in the family business and public life. In the early Industrial Revolution , the Mander family entered the vanguard of the expansion of Wolverhampton, on the edge of the largest manufacturing conurbation in the British Isles. Mander Brothers was a major employer in the city of Wolverhampton , a progressive company which became the Number One manufacturers of varnish , paint and later printing ink in the British Empire . The family became distinguished for public service, art patronage and philanthropy. Charles Tertius Mander (1852\u20131929) was created the first baronet of The Mount in the baronetage of the United Kingdom in the Coronation honours of George V , on 8 July 1911. Early history The family were franklins , settled by 1291 at Tredington on the Warwickshire / Worcestershire borders of Midland England. The Wolverhampton family descends from Henry Mander (1601\u201372), of Aston Cantlow , whose son, Samuel Mander , migrated about 1695 to Lapworth Hall (also known as 'Irelands'), where the family remained for about 200 years. In 1742, his grandson Thomas Mander (1720\u20131764), a younger son, migrated a few miles north to Wolverhampton, then a market town of just 7,500 people. There he settled as a merchant, maltster and manufacturer, and in due course inherited property from the family of his wife, Elizabeth Clemson, in John Street, which today forms the core of the modern city. Family members Benjamin (1752\u20131819) and John Mander (1754\u20131827) were Thomas's sons. By 1773, they were setting up a cluster of loosely integrated businesses in Wolverhampton, including one of the largest chemical manufacturing works in the country, together with businesses in baking, japanning and tin-plate working, canals and gas manufacture. Benjamin Mander was chairman of the Wolverhampton Union Flour and Bread Company, a milling co-operative company set up for charitable purposes to provide subsidised bread and flour in the period of social distress following the Napoleonic Wars . The two brothers campaigned actively against the slave trade, founded chapels, libraries and schools, and entered into local politics as town commissioners, four Manders sitting at one time for the Georgian borough. A third brother, Thomas Mander, set up in the hardware trade, as a factor and gun and flintlock manufacturer of Five Ways, Birmingham ; he was ancestor of the Sparrows, iron masters, of Albrighton Hall, Shrewsbury . Hereafter, the eldest sons of the senior line of the family have been given the first name Charles: Charles Mander (1780\u20131853), the eldest son of Benjamin, founded a varnish works in 1803 which was to prosper though the 19th century. He was a penal reformer who campaigned against the Blood Money Act, successfully petitioning for its repeal in 1818. The romantic story of how he rescued two soldiers from the gallows accused of stealing just 1s.1d. became the subject of a novel by the jurist Samuel Warren , Now and Then (1848). He was a noted nonconformist , whose exertions for the tenure of endowments by a 23-year Chancery case led, with other similar cases, to the Dissenters' Chapels Act 1844 . Charles Benjamin Mander JP (1819\u20131878) was the eldest son of Charles. He was the force behind the establishment of the first publicly funded institution for art education in Britain in 1852. As a town councillor, he campaigned for clean drinking water fountains, and for the free library in Wolverhampton. With the rise of the railways, he greatly expanded the business of Mander Brothers , forming a partnership with his brother Samuel in 1845. He is commemorated by a blue plaque at The Mount, Tettenhall Wood, the house he built after 1862 (now a hotel). Sir Charles Tertius Mander JP, DL (1852\u20131929), the eldest son of Benjamin, among many public offices was uniquely four times mayor of Wolverhampton 1892\u20136, an alderman , was awarded an honorary freedom of the borough ; he was a colonel in the Staffordshire Yeomanry , and the first of the family to serve as High Sheriff of Staffordshire . He was a progressive industrialist and manufacturer as the first chairman of Mander Brothers (1923), the family paint and varnish works, but also in many other companies, including a Midland electrical company credited with the invention of the spark plug . He was created the first baronet of the Mount, Tettenhall Wood , for his public services on 8 July 1911. Sir Charles Arthur Mander JP, DL, TD (1884\u20131951), the second baronet, was the elder son of Charles Tertius by Mary Le Mesurier, daughter of Henry Nicholas Paint , a Member of the Dominion Parliament of Canada . He was twice mayor of Wolverhampton, and an honorary freeman of the borough. He shot (rifle) for England while at Trinity College, Cambridge . In World War I he was a major in the Staffordshire Yeomanry, attached to the Yeomanry Mounted Division in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign . He was wounded in the Third Battle of Gaza at Beersheba in 1917, and following the decisive battle of Megiddo entered Damascus in triumph with General Allenby . He served on over 65 committees and organisations at one time, was in demand as a public speaker, and presented early radio discussion programmes. He was vice-chairman of the National Savings Committee and President of Rotary International for Britain and Ireland. In the US, he was made an honorary chief Red Crow of the Blackfoot tribe in Montana when he gave the address at the dedication of the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park , the first national park to be so dedicated, in 1932. Sir Charles Marcus Mander (1921\u20132006), the third baronet, was the only son of Charles Arthur by Monica Neame , of Kent . He fought with the Coldstream Guards in World War II in North Africa, Germany and Italy, where following the Salerno landings he was gravely wounded in the fierce fighting at Calabritto , on the slopes of Monte Camino, in October 1943. He was a director of Mander Brothers, responsible for its property portfolio, and redeveloped the centre of Wolverhampton, from 1968 establishing the Mander Shopping Centre and Mander Square on the site of the early family works. Sir Charles was High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1962\u201363 before two City posts, first as chairman of Arlington Securities (sold to British Aerospace ) and then as chairman of another property group, London & Cambridge Investments, which went bust in 1991. He developed a township for 11,500 people at Perton outside Wolverhampton on the family agricultural estate, which had been requisitioned as an airfield during World War II. His wife sustained underwriting losses as a Name in the Lloyd's insurance market in the 1990s. The Times newspaper reported on 24 June 2000, that Lady Mander, having refused a settlement offered to her by Lloyd's, was declared bankrupt. In due course, the mansion house at Little Barrow, Donnington , near Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire , was sold to meet a debt believed to be well over one million pounds.

The Spaldings of Ashintully and their cadet branches were Jacobites , or followers of the House of Stuart . The castle is reached from the B950 road to the Northeast of Kirkmichael . The name Ashintully is an anglicised spelling of the Gaelic Eas an Tulaich and means \"cascade of the hillock\". In 1597 the Earl of Atholl and his followers attacked Andrew Spalding at Ashintully, bringing great guns, hagbuts, and pistols and raising fire at the house.

The monastery was founded in 1485 by St. Savva Krypetsky, a Serbian monk from Mount Athos , in what was then described as an impracticable mire. Two years later, the Pskov veche supported his establishment by granting a large plot of land to the monks. Prince Obolensky had a road for pilgrims built through the mire to the monastery. St. Savva died on 28 August 1495 and was interred in the then timber cathedral, which was rebuilt in stone in 1547 and still stands. Famous monks of the Krypetsky Monastery included Basil, who described the life of St. Savva in the 1540s; St. Nilus, who founded the Nilov Monastery on Stolbnyi Island ; and the former chancellor Afanasy Ordin-Nashchokin , who had the monastery grounds greatly expanded and improved. In the 18th century, the abbey fell into disrepair, but was restored by Evgeny Bolkhovitinov , a bishop best known for his friendship with Gavriil Derzhavin and the latter's poems dedicated to him. In 1918, the monastery was disbanded by the Bolsheviks who plundered more than five poods (2,600 troy ounces ) of gold in the monastery sacristy and had its Neoclassical belltower disfigured. The abbey was briefly revived during the German occupation of the area in World War II and was finally restituted to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1991.

{"id": "doc_random_286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denisko_uprising", "text": "The Denisko uprising ( Polish : Insurekcja Deniski ), named after Joachim Denisko, was the first Polish rebellion after the failed Kosciuszko Uprising . It took place in late June 1797 in the regions of Pokucie and Podole , which after the Partitions of Poland became part of Austrian Galicia . Joachim Mokosiej Denisko was born in c. \u20091756 , in a Polish szlachta family of Volhynia . A Jacobin , he took part in the Kosciuszko Uprising, as a political and military commandant of the County of Krzemieniec . In 1794, he carried out a failed rebel raid on Volhynia, after which he fled to the Ottoman Empire , a traditional enemy of the Russian Empire . While in Turkey, Denisko worked on another rebellion, cooperating with a patriotic organization from Lw\u00f3w , Centralizacja Lwowska. Centralizacja Lwowska was founded in January 1796 in Krak\u00f3w , but soon afterwards its office was moved to Lw\u00f3w. Its members were mainly rich landowners from Austrian and Russian occupied parts of Poland, with bulk of them living in Galicia. Centralizacja also had members in Volhynia and former Grand Duchy of Lithuania : its target was a general insurrection, with support of Turkey and revolutionary France . The organization was commanded by Walerian Dzieduszycki , while Joachim Denisko was one of key members. First Polish military units were organized in Podole, Bukovina and Wallachia in 1795. Polish patriots hoped for an armed conflict between Russia and Turkey (see History of the Russo-Turkish wars ), in which they supported the Ottomans. The number of Polish military personnel in northern provinces of the Ottoman Empire was about 1700; their camps were visited by French and English officers. In early March 1797, a group of Polish officers created Zwiazek Wojskowy (Military Association), commanded by Joachim Denisko. An Act of Insurrection was published, in which the abolition of social divisions and serfdom was promised. Walerian Dzieduszycki was named military leader of the rebellion, while Karol Kniaziewicz became its civilian leader, and speaker of the National Assembly. In May 1797, after an internal conflict, Denisko was forced to give up his post. Furthermore, as a result of activities of Russian intelligence services, several members of Centralizacja Lwowska were arrested, including Dzieduszycki. Despite these setbacks, on 26 June Denisko, with 200 supporters, crossed the Austrian - Turkish border near Zaleszczyki . Four days later, on 30 June, after the Battle of Debronowice (the only major battle of the uprising), Austrian forces destroyed the Polish detachment. Some Poles managed to return to Turkey; those captured were hanged on 11 July near Czerniowce . By the end of July, all Polish military camps were destroyed. Denisko himself fled to Turkey. In 1798 he returned to Volhynia, after the Russian government declared an amnesty. He died in 1812 in Saint Petersburg .

Etymology Its name comes from Syriac - Aramaic \u0725\u072a\u0721\u0710 ( \u2018arma ), feminine counterpart being \u0725\u072a\u0721\u072c\u0710 ( \u2018armta ), which means 'rugged', 'rough', 'steep', or 'high'. History In the 1596 tax records , the village was named in the Ottoman nahiya (subdistrict) of Sagif under the liwa' (district) of Safad , with a population of 14 households, all Muslim . The villagers paid a fixed tax-rate of 25% on agricultural products, such as wheat , barley , fruit trees, goats and beehives, in addition to \"occasional revenues\"; a total of 1,355 ak\u00e7e . On 14 April 1994 three SLA militiamen were killed by a landmine near the village. In response the SLA shelled Sidon killing three civilians. Two days later the SLA attacked Aaramta killing two people and expelling the villagers to Jezzine . Five SLA men had been killed the same day near Jezzine. In May 2023, Hezbollah 's Redwan Force conducted training exercises near the village, as part of a media tour aimed at showcasing the organization's military prowess. These drills encompassed various demonstrations, such as drone displays that featured flags, hand-to-hand combat, explosive exercises, and simulations of cross-border incursions into Israel. Demographics In 2014, Muslims made up 97.94% of registered voters in Aaramta. 95.27% of the voters were Shiite Muslims .

{"id": "doc_random_290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967%E2%80%9368_St._Louis_Blues_season", "text": "The 1967\u201368 St. Louis Blues season was the inaugural season in the history of the franchise. The Blues were one of the six new teams added to the NHL in the 1967 expansion . The other franchises were the Minnesota North Stars , Los Angeles Kings , Philadelphia Flyers , Pittsburgh Penguins , and California Seals (later rebranded to the Oakland Seals during the season before the Blues had a chance to play the Seals while they used their California name). The league doubled in size from its Original Six . St. Louis was the last of the expansion teams to officially get into the league. The Blues were chosen over Baltimore at the insistence of the Chicago Black Hawks . The Black Hawks were owned at that time by the Wirtz family, who also owned the St. Louis Arena . The team's first owners were insurance tycoon Sid Salomon Jr., his son, Sid Salomon III, and Robert L. Wolfson. Sid Salomon III convinced his initially wary father to make a bid for the team. Salomon then spent several million dollars on renovations for the 38-year-old Arena, which increased the number of seats from 12,000 to 15,000 and provided its first significant maintenance since the 1940s. Because the playoff format required an expansion team to make it to the Stanley Cup finals, the Blues became the first expansion team to reach that mark. However, they were the last of the still operating 1967 expansion teams to win the cup, which they did in 2019. Offseason NHL draft The Blues attempted to select Saskatoon Blades forward Dale Fairbrother with their first round pick, but the pick was ruled invalid since Fairbrother was on the Portland Buckaroos ' sponsored list. The Blues passed on making selections in the second and third rounds. Regular season Original logo of the St. Louis Blues The franchise's first game was played on October 11, 1967. The Blues and Minnesota North Stars played to a 2\u20132 tie at the St. Louis Arena, with the Blues' first ever team goal scored by Larry Keenan of North Bay, Ontario. A St. Michaels product, Keenan had his career end prematurely due to injuries. He relocated back to North Bay where he coached a local Midget AAA team for many years. The Blues were originally coached by Lynn Patrick who resigned in late-November and was replaced by Scotty Bowman . Although the league's rules effectively kept star players with the Original Six teams, the Blues were one of the stronger teams of the West Division . The playoff format required an expansion team to make it to the Stanley Cup finals, and the Blues made it to the final round. Season standings Record vs. opponents Playoffs Stanley Cup Final The Blues beat the North Stars in a game 7 double overtime and made the Stanley Cup Final. Although they lost in four straight games, they played proudly, as all four games each were decided by just one goal (and two of the four were decided in overtime ). Glenn Hall was especially noted for his goaltending, especially in game three when the Blues were outshot 46 to 15. Red Burnett , one of the most prominent hockey writers of the day, said of Hall's playing, \"A number of Hall's saves were seemingly impossible. Experts walked out of the Forum convinced no other goaltender had performed so brilliantly in a losing cause.\" In overtime in game three, Hall made an exceptional save on Dick Duff and then, standing on his head, made another. Burnett said, \"It was a heartbreaker to see. After the saves on Duff, Bobby Rousseau came and batted home the second rebound.\" Hall's playing won him the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player in the playoffs. However, Montreal was not to be denied and won the Stanley Cup in game four as J. C. Tremblay fired home the winning goal. When the game ended, the fans came on the ice to celebrate, and balloons, hats and programs were thrown from the stands.

{"id": "doc_random_291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Samaritan", "text": "USS Samaritan (AH-10) was a hospital ship that served with the US Navy in World War II . Prior to that, she served as a US Navy transport ship under the name USS Chaumont (AP-5) . USS Chaumont , one of twelve 13,400-ton (displacement) Hog Island Type B (Design 1024) transports laid down in November 1918 as SS Shope for the U.S. Shipping Board , launched in March 1920 at Hog Island, Pennsylvania by the American International Shipbuilding Corporation. In November 1920 the ship was delivered to the Shipping Board and transferred to the War Department on 15 December 1920 with assignment to the U.S. Army Transport Service . Redundant to Army needs, she was transferred \"on loan\" to the Navy on 3 November 1921 and commissioned on the 22nd, Lieutenant Commander G. H. Emmerson in temporary command. On 1 December 1921, Commander C.L. Arnold assumed command. Permanent transfer to the Navy by Executive order was effective 6 August 1924. Peacetime service Assigned to transport duty, Chaumont sailed the Atlantic , Pacific , and Caribbean throughout the 1920s and 1930s. From her home port at San Francisco , she commenced a career of trans-Pacific troop service that initially consisted of voyages between California and Manila via Honolulu . Two or three voyages in 1925-26 took her to Shanghai instead of Manila, and she continued to stop at Shanghai at least once during most subsequent years. One of her most important contributions, when in the Pacific, was aiding in the collection of meteorological information used by the Weather Map Service of the Asiatic Fleet . She also carried military supplies, Marine expeditionary forces, sailors and their dependents, and occasionally members of congressional committees on inspection tours, calling at ports from Shanghai to Bermuda . In August 1926 she sailed from San Francisco through the Panama Canal to Annapolis . The return trip took her to Norfolk, Virginia , where she was drydocked for routine maintenance, and then to Guantanamo Bay . Such voyages between the East and West Coasts also became near-annual events. Missions to Shanghai Chaumont' s voyages to Shanghai provided important assistance to U.S. Far Eastern diplomacy during the 1920s and 1930s by supporting the Marine Corps units deployed to the International Settlement in that city to protect U.S. nationals there. At the end of January 1932 Japanese forces in the Settlement attacked nearby Chinese forces, leading to intensive fighting in the city. USS Chaumont with the 6th Marine Regiment, Shanghai , China 1937 Chaumont was in Manila at the time, and on 31 January the Navy Department ordered her to embark the 1,000 men of the Army's 31st Infantry Regiment and sail for Shanghai. Responding rapidly, Chaumont cleared Manila with the troops on board on 2 February and arrived at Shanghai on the 5th. Five years later, in mid-September 1937, Chaumont rushed the 6th Marine Regiment to Shanghai to reinforce the 4th Regiment that was protecting the Settlement during the all-out Japanese effort to seize the city from tenacious Chinese defenders. Chaumont suffered two mishaps during her China service in 1936\u201337, a week-long period aground at Qinhuangdao and a collision at Shanghai with the Italian cruiser Raimondo Montecuccoli . World War II When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Chaumont was on one of her regular voyages from Hawaii to Manila, carrying sailors, civilian workmen, and cargo that included munitions. She was diverted as part of the \" Pensacola Convoy \" to Brisbane then, after a period of reloading the convoy's men and cargo, she proceeded to Darwin , Australia with Navy supplies where she discharged her passengers and cargo on 5 January 1942. After returning to Brisbane she went to Sydney then Wellington, New Zealand and Balboa before returning to San Francisco on 29 March 1942. After two runs to Pearl Harbor, the now elderly transport was assigned to service between Seattle and Alaska , bringing men and supplies to assist in the defense of the Aleutians . Selected in March 1943 for conversion to a hospital ship , Chaumont was decommissioned in August for conversion at Seattle. Renamed Samaritan (AH-10), she was recommissioned in March 1944. Between 25 March and 11 May, she made two voyages from San Francisco to Hawaii, with passengers outward bound and patients homeward bound. Arriving in Honolulu a third time 11 May, she continued to Kwajalein , where from 17 June to 1 July, she treated casualties from the Saipan invasion. On 8 July she arrived off Saipan itself to embark patients for evacuation to Noumea , New Caledonia , from which she returned to Saipan 1 August for two weeks of duty as a receiving hospital. Off Iwo Jima , February 1945 Samaritan evacuated patients from Guam to Guadalcanal , and from Peleliu to the Russell Islands in August and September 1944. After a brief overhaul at Espiritu Santo , she served as base hospital at Ulithi until 16 February 1945, when she sailed for Iwo Jima . She arrived off the bitterly engaged island 20 February, and sailed 2 days later with 606 patients on board for Saipan. On the second day out, eight men were buried at sea. The hospital ship returned to Iwo Jima 25 February 1945 to embark patients for transportation to Guam on the first of two such voyages. She arrived at Ulithi 2 April, and a week later got underway for embattled Okinawa . Arriving 13 April, she received casualties at the beach during the daytime and withdrew at night to the transport areas offshore, alternating her stays at Okinawa with evacuation voyages to Saipan until 1 July, when she sailed from Saipan for Pearl Harbor. Here she took patients from several island hospitals on board, sailed to San Francisco, and on 10 September back to Pearl Harbor thence Sasebo , where she provided hospital facilities to occupation forces until 15 March 1946. Decommissioning She returned to San Francisco 23 April, and was decommissioned there 25 June 1946. On 29 August 1946 she was transferred to the Maritime Commission for disposal, and was delivered to a scrapping firm in January 1948. Awards Samaritan received four battle stars for World War II service. Media USS Chaumont features in the WEB Griffin series of novels, \"The Corps\" .

It is a shrub or small tree with densely hairy branchlets, egg-shaped to broadly elliptic leaves, and racemes or panicles of cream-coloured flowers. Description Pomaderris racemosa is a shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20138\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in\u00a0\u2013 26\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) and has its branchlets densely covered with soft, star-shaped hairs. Its leaves are egg-shaped to broadly elliptic, mostly 15\u201320\u00a0mm (0.59\u20130.79\u00a0in) long and 8\u201312\u00a0mm (0.31\u20130.47\u00a0in) wide with stipules 2\u20134\u00a0mm (0.079\u20130.157\u00a0in) long at the base, but that fall off as the leaf develops. The upper surface of the leaves is more or less glabrous and the lower surface is covered with soft, star-shaped hairs. The flowers are cream-coloured and borne at the ends of branchlets or in leaf axils in racemes or panicles 20\u201340\u00a0mm (0.79\u20131.57\u00a0in) long. Each flower is on a pedicel 1\u20133.5\u00a0mm (0.039\u20130.138\u00a0in) long with egg-shaped bracts 5\u20136\u00a0mm (0.20\u20130.24\u00a0in) long at the base, but that fall off as the flowers open. The sepals are 1.5\u20131.8\u00a0mm (0.059\u20130.071\u00a0in) long but fall off as the flowers mature and there are no petals. Flowering occurs from October to December. Taxonomy Pomaderris racemosa was first formally described in 1834 by William Jackson Hooker in The Journal of Botany from specimens collected by Robert William Lawrence in 1831. Distribution and habitat This pomaderris grows in sheltered forest or in scrub from south-eastern South Australia to Rosedale in Victoria and in scattered locations along rivers and on the edges of lakes in Tasmania.

Also a journalist, writing since 1993 for The New York Times , she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism in 1995. Other publications for which she has written include Vogue , New York Magazine , The Nation , and Guernica . Biography Jefferson received her B.A. degree from Brandeis University , where she graduated cum laude , and her M.S. from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism . She became an associate editor at Newsweek in 1973 and stayed at the magazine until 1978. She then served as an assistant professor at the Department of Journalism and Mass Communication at New York University from 1979 to 1983 and from 1989 to 1991. Since then, Jefferson has taught at the Columbia University School of the Arts , where she is now professor of professional practice in writing. Jefferson also taught at The New School 's Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts . She joined The New York Times in 1993, initially as a book reviewer, then went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism in 1995. She also served as the newspaper's theater critic in 2004. In addition to the Times , she has written for Vogue , New York Magazine , The Nation , and Guernica . Jefferson has a longstanding interest in jazz, and appeared in Ken Burns ' 2001 television documentary series about the history of the music. Writing Jefferson's 2006 book, On Michael Jackson , was described by Publishers Weekly as a \"slim, smart volume of cultural analysis\". According to Lucy Scholes in The Independent : \"The excellent On Michael Jackson is not a straightforward biography, nor is it an attempt to claim either his innocence or his guilt when it comes to the child abuse scandals that, although he was acquitted, haunt his afterlife. A 'deciphering' is probably the most accurate description of the book, the shrewd playfulness of Jefferson's prose the perfect vehicle for analysis that's as smart as it is readable.\" Jefferson's autobiographical book, Negroland: A Memoir , was published in 2015. It was described by Dwight Garner in The New York Times as a \"powerful and complicated memoir\", and by Margaret Busby in The Sunday Times as \"utterly compelling\", while Anita Sethi wrote in The Observer : \"Jefferson fascinatingly explores how her personal experience intersected with politics, from the civil rights movement to feminism, as well as history before her birth.\" Tracy K. Smith wrote in The New York Times : \"The visible narrative apparatus of 'Negroland' highlights its author's extreme vulnerability in the face of her material. It also makes apparent the all-too-often invisible fallout of our nation's ongoing obsession with race and class: Namely, that living a life as an exemplar of black excellence \u2014 and living with the survivor's guilt that often accompanies such excellence \u2014 can have a psychic effect nearly as deadening and dehumanizing as that of racial injustice itself.\" In 2016, Negroland was shortlisted for the Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction and won the National Book Critics Circle Award in the Autobiography category. Jefferson is a contributor to the 2019 anthology New Daughters of Africa , edited by Margaret Busby . In 2022, Jefferson was the recipient of a Windham-Campbell Literature Prize in the category of non-fiction. Her book Constructing a Nervous System was a finalist for ALA 2023 Carnegie Medal and the 2023 National Book Critics Circle award in criticism.

{"id": "doc_random_295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Zamborlin", "text": "Bruno Zamborlin (born 1983 in Vicenza ) is an AI researcher , entrepreneur and artist based in London , working in the field of human-computer interaction . His work focuses on converting physical objects into touch-sensitive, interactive surfaces using vibration sensors and artificial intelligence . In 2013, he founded Mogees Limited a start-up to transform everyday objects into musical instruments and games using a vibration sensor and a mobile phone. With HyperSurfaces, he converts physical surfaces of any material, shape and form into data-enabled-interactive surfaces using a vibration sensor and a coin-sized chipset . As an artist, he has created art installations around the world, with his most recent work comprising a unique series of \"sound furnitures\" that was showcased at the Italian Pavilion of the Venice Biennale 2023. He regularly performed with UK-based electronic music duo Plaid ( Warp Records ). He is also honorary visiting research fellow at Goldsmiths, University of London . Early life and education From 2008-2011, Zamborlin worked at the IRCAM (Institute for Research and Coordination Acoustic Musical) \u2013 Centre Pompidou as a member of the Sound Music Movement Interaction team. Under the supervision of Frederic Bevilacqua, he started experimenting with the use of artificial intelligence and human movements, and contributed to the creation of Gesture Follower, a software used to analyse body movements of performers and dancers through motion sensors in order to control sound and visual media in real-time , slowing down or speeding up their reproduction based on the speed the gestures are performed. He has lived in London since 2011, where he developed a joint PhD between Goldsmiths, University of London and IRCAM - Centre Pompidou / Pierre and Marie Curie University Paris in AI, focussing on the concept of Interactive Machine Learning applied to digital musical instruments and performing arts. Career Zamborlin founded Mogees Limited in 2013 in London , with IRCAM being amongst the early partners. Mogees transform physical objects into musical instruments and games using a vibration sensor and a series of apps for smartphones and desktop . After a campaign on Kickstarter in 2014, Mogees was used both by common users and artists such as Rodrigo y Gabriela , Jean-Michel Jarre and Plaid . The algorithms implemented in these apps employ a special version of physical modelling sound synthesis , where the vibration produced by users when interacting with the physical object are used as exciter for a digital resonator which runs in the app. The result is a hybrid, half acoustic and half digital sound which is a function of both software and acoustic properties of the physical object the users decide to play. In 2017, Zamborlin founded HyperSurfaces together with computational artist Parag K Mital. to merge \"the physical and the digital worlds\". HyperSurfaces technology converts any surface made of any material, shape and size into data-enabled interactive objects, employing a vibration sensor and proprietary AI algorithms running on a coin-sized chipset . The vibrations generated by people's interactions on the surface are converted into an electric signal by a piezoelectric sensor and analysed in realtime by AI algorithms that run on the chipset. Anytime the AI recognises in the vibration signal one of the events that have been predefined by the user beforehand, a corresponding notification message is generated in realtime and sent to some application. The technology can be applied to anything ranging from button-less human-computer interaction applications for automotive and smart home to the Internet of things . Because the AI algorithms employed by HyperSurfaces run locally on a chipset, without the need to access cloud-based services, they are considered to be part of the field of edge computing . Also, because the AI can be trained beforehand to recognise the events its users are interested in, HyperSurfaces algorithms belong to the field of supervised machine learning .

The name Wazap! originates from the fusion of the Japanese word 'waza (\u6280)' meaning 'technique' and 'up', symbolizing improvement. History Wazap first launched in Japan in 2001 as a community website for gamers . Initially a mix of gaming news and user generated content , Wazap was then redeveloped as a gaming search and information distribution site. Following initial success in Japan, Wazap was launched in other markets, beginning with Germany in 2004 under the auspices of Wazap AG. In November 2006, Wazap launched Wazap (CN) in China . The US version of Wazap launched in June 2007. By 2008, however, Wazap had failed to gain traction outside of Japan, and its German , Chinese and American operations were closed down. As of October 2018, it continues to operate solely in Japan.

The series starts with One Life to Live storylines (1968\u20131979) . The plot continues in One Life to Live storylines (1980\u20131989) . The plot in the next decade is outlined in One Life to Live storylines (1990\u20131999) and the story concludes in One Life to Live storylines (2000\u20142013) . 1968\u20131978 The earliest storylines of One Life to Live focused on the blue collar , Polish Catholic Wolek family , and the super-rich Lords . Additionally, there was also the Rileys , although most of the latter were featured much less prominently. One Life to Live is also noteworthy for including a Black family, the Grays, from the show's earliest episodes. Sadie and Carla Further information: Carla Gray \"A woman came to town with a mystery. Everybody knew she was important, because she was on almost every day of the week. So they knew that she was going to be some kind of major story but they couldn't figure out what she was gonna be, because she wasn't the usual blonde, blue-eyed leading female. She looked very...exotic. And she had this exotic name, Carla Benari.\" \u2014Ellen Holly on the beginnings of her One Life to Live character, Television Academy Foundation One of the show's earliest and most controversial storylines was the one that played out between housekeeping director at Llanview Hospital, Sadie Gray ( Lillian Hayman ), and Carla Benari ( Ellen Holly ), an actress who arrived in Llanview and became a patient of Dr. Jim Craig's ( Robert Milli ) at the hospital. Assumed to be Italian American , Carla Benari is an important character immediately upon her arrival, becoming involved in a love triangle between Dr. Craig and internist Price Trainor (Peter DeAnda). Carla also strikes up a friendship with Anna Wolek ( Doris Belack ), unaware that Sadie is Anna's neighbor and best friend which would become relevant as the storyline progressed on-screen. At this point in the storyline, one ABC affiliate in Texas briefly dropped One Life to Live from its schedule due to the storyline in which Price Trainor, a black man, kissed Carla Benari, who was believed to be white. The character of Carla, despite debuting in episode 61, months after the show's July 1968 premiere, was conceptualized in Agnes Nixon's original show Bible, and as such is considered part of the story of Llanview from the beginning. Nixon has said she was inspired to create the Carla Gray character after seeing singer Eartha Kitt in a television interview. Kitt expressed her own frustration at facing prejudice from both white and black audiences because of her light-skinned complexion, and the feeling of not belonging to either group. (Even Carla's surname \"Gray\" reflects the in-between nature of the character, not \"black\" or \"white\".) According to actress Ellen Holly's memoir , One Life: An Autobiography of an African American Actress , Nixon based Carla's mother Sadie on a maid who worked for Nixon's family when she was growing up much the same way that Sadie on One Life initially worked as a maid for the Lord family . Nixon based Carla and Sadie's original story on the film Imitation of Life , in which a light-skinned Black woman denies her heritage and her darker-complected mother, and enters white society by passing . The revelation that Carla Benari was actually Black did not come until Ellen Holly had appeared in the role on-screen for five months. It was to be revealed that Carla Benari was actually \"Clara Gray\", who was mentioned from the earliest episodes by Sadie as the daughter who was \"lost to her\". Anna Wolek and her family, and by extension the audience, assumed Clara was dead. Holly spoke about the historic episodes in a 2018 Television Academy Foundation interview: [In] the fifth month in which everybody's invested all their energy in learning about these people for these five months, that day, on a Friday \u2014 deliberately chosen for Friday \u2014 the cameras started following a whole bunch of people during their daily [routines], including Carla and Sadie...And at the end of the day, five minutes before that, Sadie and Carla Benari meet in front of Anna Wolek's door. [Sadie's] visiting her neighbor. [Carla's] going there for some other reason. They stand there and they look at each other and Sadie looks at me and says, \"Clara!\" And I say, \"Mama!\" Cut to black! Well, everybody got on the phone that week: \"Did you see that on Friday? Clara, that dead girl, that was supposed to...?\" ...The world checked in on Monday to get the backstory. The backstory was that she was an actress and she wanted to be a big star and she went to the bright lights of the big city and found out nobody could give a damn, and also it wasn't helpful to be black, so she started passing for white, and that didn't do too well either, and she ended up on some lousy bus-and-truck tour that had come back to town. \u2014\u200aEllen Holly Carla chooses to live as \"Carla Benari\" for a little while longer, eventually becoming engaged to Dr. Craig, who was willing to keep her secret should she continue to want to live as \"Carla Benari\". The storyline eventually ended with Carla calling off her engagement and informing everyone in Llanview of her true identity, including to Price Trainor, who is furious. He tries to give Carla another chance, but it does not work out and he accepts a job offer overseas. While originally very heartbroken by Carla's rejection, Sadie regains a close and loving relationship with her daughter, who apologizes for her hurtful actions. While changing her surname back to \"Gray\", she decides to keep the forename \"Carla\". Ratings shot up for the then-fledgling soap, and as it was the first daytime soap opera to feature a Black woman, namely Ellen Holly, in a leading role, One Life to Live began to score high ratings in the African American demographic. Larry/Merrie in love Young intern Dr. Larry Wolek (Paul Tulley, Jim Storm , from 1969 onward Michael Storm ) falls in love with Meredith Lord ( Trish Van Devere , Lynn Benesch ) the younger of two daughters of Victor Lord ( Ernest Graves , Shepperd Strudwick ). They initially met when Larry helped treat Merrie's heart condition. Victor disapproved of Larry as a suitor for his daughter and forbade her seeing him. Frustrated, Larry turned to Karen Martin (Niki Flacks), a nurse who saved his life when he was trapped in a fire. Larry wed Karen, but realized soon afterward it was a mistake; he didn't love her. He did stay with her when he found out she was pregnant however. Meanwhile, a heart-broken Merrie became involved with Tom Edwards (Joseph Gallison), a young man whom she found wandering in the park with amnesia and who was more to Victor's liking. Karen miscarried her baby and agreed to a divorce . Larry wanted to court Merrie again, but she had already accepted Tom's proposal. Ultimately though, Merrie chose to wed Larry. Merrie went through her own extremely difficult pregnancy, but successfully delivered twins, a son Danny (who would eventually grow up to be a doctor as well) and a daughter who died at birth. She suffered from post-partum depression . She was also held hostage by two escaped convicts for a prolonged period. Tragically, she died of a brain aneurysm in 1973, leaving Larry crushed. \"Niki Smith\" Merrie's sister Victoria Lord (originated by Gillian Spencer , from 1971 onward Erika Slezak ) was a sexually repressed young woman who lived for her father's approval. When brash reporter Joe Riley (Lee Patterson) began to chip away at her defenses, the fun-loving blonde-wigged \"Niki Smith\" began showing up at local bars. Joe's best friend, truck-driver (and later police officer) Vinny Wolek ( Antony Ponzini , Jordan Charney , Michael Ingram), fell in love with Niki. When he realized she was really a split-personality (or 'alter') of Viki, he told Joe the truth. Viki underwent psychoanalysis with Dr. Polk, and her split-personality seemed at the time to be cured. She married Joe soon afterward. A few years later, Joe was presumed dead. Viki married reporter Steve Burke ( Bernard Grant ), who at the time was being stalked by the psychopathic Marcy Wade ( Francesca James ). Steve went on trial for her murder, and was ultimately cleared by none other than Joe himself, who had survived his presumably fatal car crash, but had been amnesiac for over a year. Poor Viki suddenly found herself with two husbands, and had a difficult time deciding on which husband to stay married. Viki and Joe reunited, but not before he had a child with Cathy Craig ( Dorrie Kavanaugh ). When the child died, Cathy kidnapped Viki and Joe's baby, Kevin Riley, in 1977. Anti-drugs The show also had a sustained anti- drug storyline centering on wild child Cathy Craig ( Catherine Burns , Amy Levitt, Jane Alice Brandon, Dorrie Kavanaugh, Jennifer Harmon). Cathy was the only daughter of widower Dr. Jim Craig (Robert Milli, Nat Polen). She resented her father's second marriage to Anna Wolek ( Doris Belack , Kathleen Maguire , Phyllis Behar). Cathy rebelled by taking drugs, and spiralled into addiction. While on a bad acid trip , she murdered her drug dealer Artie Duncan (John Cullum), but blocked the incident out of her memory. Vinnie was wrongly accused and sentenced for the crime. Cathy finally recalled her actions and confessed. Rather than go to jail, she was sent to Odyssey House , a real-life NYC treatment center for drug-addicted youths. In an unusual move, Cathy's portrayer, actress Amy Levitt, was videotaped while sitting in on real-life therapy sessions at Odyssey House, which were then broadcast as OLTL episodes during the summer of 1970. Dorian Cramer Dr. Dorian Cramer ( Nancy Pinkerton , on-and-off from 1979 Robin Strasser ) arrived in Llanview in April 1973 with her sister, Melinda ( Patricia Pearcy ); the following year she and her married lover Dr. Mark Toland ( Tommy Lee Jones ) conspired to cover up their complicity in the death of patient, Rachel Wilson ( Nancy Barrett ). When the truth came out, Dorian was suspended from Llanview hospital; erroneously believing Viki was partly responsible, Dorian vowed revenge. After becoming the private physician to Viki's ailing father Victor, she married him, and schemed to control his fortune. Dorian's machinations further fueled the enmity between Viki and herself. After Victor's mysterious death in 1976, the shadow of suspicion surrounded Dorian for decades. Decline and resurgence As social issue-oriented stories on matters such as race and drug addiction played themselves out, ratings fell; in response, in 1975 ABC hired high-priced Another World actors George Reinholt and Jacqueline Courtney to portray Tony Lord and Pat Ashley . The numbers rose, but the pairing never achieved the success expected by executives. Reinholt left after only two years and replaced by Philip MacHale and, later, Chip Lucia; Courtney was fired in 1983. The show did have huge success in the middle and late 1970s with new character-siblings Jenny ( Katherine Glass , Brynn Thayer ) and Karen Wolek (Kathryn Breech, Julia Duffy , Judith Light ), distant cousins of the original Wolek family . Jenny was a novitiate nun who left the convent after falling in love with Tim Siegel ( Tom Berenger ). Her cousin Vinnie was angry, and accused Tim of 'stealing Jenny from the church.' Vinnie & Tim got into a physical fight, one that left Tim with grave head injuries from which he died soon afterwards. Jenny married Tim on his deathbed. Later, Jenny married bad boy Brad Vernon (Steve Fletcher, Jameson Parker ), a philandering Lothario who caused her no small amount of grief. Karen seduced Larry into marrying her, a controversial move in itself given that they were related (albeit several familial relations removed). But Karen, bored with married life and suffering overwhelming self-esteem problems, began turning tricks in the daytime with rich suitors in exchange for expensive 'gifts.' The sleazy opportunist Marco Dane ( Gerald Anthony ) discovered Karen's trysts and blackmailed her into becoming a housewife hooker, turning tricks for his clientele while Larry was at work. Karen was overwhelmed with guilt, and finally confessed to Viki her secret life. Viki helped Karen escape Marco's control. Also appearing for the first time in 1978 was Viki's teenage ward Tina Clayton ( Andrea Evans ), introduced as the orphaned daughter of Viki's college friend Irene Manning Clayton (Kate McKeown) who asked Viki to be Tina's guardian before she died. Red-headed, free-spirited Tina seemed quite a lot like Viki's alter-ego Niki Smith, and was almost as troublesome. Nevertheless, Viki did her best to be a good mother figure to Tina. It would be years later that the two women learned how close their bond really was. 1979: Murder of Marco Dane A Grand Jury indicted Viki for the murder of Marco Dane . Karen Wolek searched for her hooker friend, Katrina Karr (Nancy Snyder), because she believed Katrina knew who killed Marco. Karen confided this to her client Talbot Huddleston (Byron Sanders), who was concerned Katrina may have seen him kill Marco. D.A. Herb Callison (Anthony Call) dropped the biggest bombshell of all by calling a surprise witness; Marco Dane's twin brother, Dr. Mario Corelli (also played by Gerald Anthony). Mario introduced damaging letters Marco had written to him about how Viki had threatened him. Viki's trial reached a thrilling climax when Karen took the stand for the defense. Karen had finally found Katrina. In exchange for money she needed for drugs, Katrina gave Karen the combination to a Post Office box, which Katrina claimed contained information revealing the identity of Marco Dane's killer. When Karen went to the Post Office to get the information, she discovered to her horror the killer had beaten her to it. Also, Katrina had been run down by a car and was now lying comatose in Llanview hospital. Karen correctly guessed Talbot was the killer and prepared to break the news in court. As Karen took the stand, she was savagely cross-examined by Herb, who forced her to reveal her secret life as a hooker. Larry listened in stunned silence as his wife revealed she had been turning tricks when he thought she was tending to their home. Katrina later came out of her coma and named Talbot as the killer. This was enough to exonerate Viki, but Karen's marriage to Larry appeared to be doomed. Dorian led a vicious campaign to have Larry ousted as Chief of Staff of Llanview Hospital. Dorian ordained her old friend and mentor, Dr. Ivan Kipling (Jack Betts), as Larry's replacement; A move the ambitious and cutthroat Dr. Kipling strongly favored. Larry offered to make another go of his marriage. Karen realized she'd always be Larry's albatross, and decided to divorce him. Dr. Mario Corelli settled in Llanview. In time, Karen discovered an amazing truth. Mario was really Marco Dane. He wasn't dead after all. Karen forced Marco to tell what really happened the night he was supposedly murdered. Marco was horrified to discover the dead body of his brother Mario, and made the instant decision to exchange identities with the corpse. Marco implored Karen to keep his secret, telling her he'd been \"born again.\" Karen agreed on one condition. He had to stop practicing medicine. Marco agreed. Gambling debts Jenny was delighted to be pregnant with Brad's baby. Brad had developed a compulsion for gambling . With his losses mounting, Brad stole Jenny's key to the hospital's pharmacy . Brad gave the key to a mobster named Brick in exchange for forgiving Brad's gambling debts. When Brick and an accomplice tried to rob the pharmacy, they were caught by Dr. Jack Scott (Arthur Burghardt), who was shot and paralyzed in the violent exchange. Feeling guilty Brad was home alone without her, Jenny asked Karen to look after him. Karen knew Brad did not like her, but Karen would do whatever Jenny wanted. Brad and Karen clashed at first, but eventually Brad became fascinated by his sexy sister-in-law . The fascination grew into obsession. One night, Brad tried to seduce his sister-in-law, but the seduction turned to rape . Karen knew she couldn't reveal a word about the rape because if Jenny were to find out, it would all but destroy her. Larry began his own detective work and realized Brad raped Karen. In a rage, Larry beat Brad to a pulp. Jenny threw Brad out of their apartment. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge, and was sentenced to three months in prison. Jenny gave premature birth to her tiny baby about the same time Katrina gave birth to her own healthy baby. When Karen and Marco were visiting the hospital, Jenny's baby went into cardiac arrest and died before their eyes. In a panic, Karen and Marco switched Jenny's baby with Katrina's baby. Katrina fell into a deep depression when she was told her baby died. Jenny took baby Mary home, never suspecting the precious little girl belonged to another woman. When Pat discovered her new husband Adam Brewster (John Mansfield) had put all moral considerations aside in order to get his financial empire back in order, she quickly had their new marriage annulled. For comfort, Pat turned to her TV producer, Dick Grant (A.C. Weary). In Pat's presence, Dick was a cheerful, charming, very outgoing gentleman. However, unbeknownst to Pat, Dick had developed a psychotic crush on her. When Samantha discovered Dick had turned his apartment into a photo-covered shrine to Pat, he kidnapped her, and then Pat, before the police apprehended him. Viki received some joyous news when she discovered she was pregnant with her second child. Joe began suffering all the classic signs of a recurrence of his brain tumor . When Joe learned he had only a few weeks left, he treated Viki to a wonderful wedding anniversary . With time running out, Joe hand-picked his successor as editor of The Banner. He sent for the editor of a small but prestigious newspaper in Arizona. The man's name was Clint Buchanan (Clint Ritchie). Joe broke the news of his prognosis to Viki, shortly before succumbing to his illness. He beseeched Viki to move on with her life after he was gone. Viki poured her energies into working with Clint at The Banner, and fending off a takeover attempt by her arch-rival, Dorian Lord.
